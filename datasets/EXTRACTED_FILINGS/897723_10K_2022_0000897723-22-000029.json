With our extensive market knowledge and global/regional footprint, we can align these solutions to our facilities in each region around the world.\nSales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50% of our net sales. Nokia and Motorola each represented 10% or more of our net sales in 2022. Nokia represented 10% or more of our net sales in 2021 and 2020.\nWe typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers with terms ranging from three to five years. Our supply agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products. However, the customer is typically liable for the cost of the materials and components we have ordered to meet their production forecast but which are not used, provided that the material was ordered in accordance with an agreed-upon procurement plan. In some cases, the procurement plan contains provisions regarding the types of materials for which our customers will assume responsibility. Our supply agreements generally contain provisions permitting cancellation and rescheduling of orders upon notice and are subject to cancellation charges and, in some cases, rescheduling charges. In some circumstances, our supply agreements with customers include provisions for cost reduction objectives during the term of the agreement, which can have the effect of reducing revenue and profitability from these arrangements.\nCompetition\nFor our integrated manufacturing solutions business, we face competition from other major global EMS companies such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), Jabil Inc. and Plexus Corp. Our components, products and services business faces competition from EMS and non-EMS companies that often have a regional product, service or industry-specific focus. In addition, our potential customers may also compare the benefits of outsourcing their manufacturing to us with the merits of manufacturing products themselves.\nWe compete with different companies depending on the type of solution or geographic area. We believe the primary competitive factors in our industry include manufacturing technology, quality, global/regional footprint, delivery, responsiveness, provision of value-added solutions and price. We believe our primary competitive strengths include our ability to provide mission critical end-to-end solutions, product design and engineering resources, vertically integrated manufacturing solutions, advanced technologies, global manufacturing capabilities, global supplier base, customer focus and responsiveness, expertise in serving diverse end markets, and expertise in industry standards and regulatory requirements.\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications relating to, among other things, printed circuit board manufacturing technology, enclosures, cables, memory modules, optical technology, medical devices and computing and\nstorage. For other proprietary processes, we rely primarily on trade secret protection. A number of our patents have expired or will expire in the near term. The expiration and abandonment of patents reduces our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use similar technologies and to license such patents to third parties. We have registered a number of trademarks and have pending trademark applications in both the U.S. and internationally. Sanmina, Viking, Viking Enterprise Solutions, Viking Technology and 42Q are registered trademarks of Sanmina Corporation.\nCompliance with Government Regulations\nEnvironmental Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the storage and use of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing processes, as well as the storage, treatment, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous waste that are by-products of these processes. We are also subject to occupational safety and health laws, product labeling and product content requirements, either directly or as required by our customers. Proper waste disposal is a major consideration for printed circuit board manufacturers due to the metals and chemicals used in the manufacturing process. Water used in the printed circuit board manufacturing process must be treated to remove metal particles and other contaminants before it can be discharged into municipal sanitary sewer systems. We operate on-site wastewater treatment systems at our printed circuit board manufacturing plants in order to treat wastewater generated in the fabrication process.\nAdditionally, the electronics assembly process can generate lead dust. Upon vacating a facility, we are responsible for remediating lead dust from the interior of the manufacturing facility. Although there are no applicable standards for lead dust remediation in manufacturing facilities, we endeavor to remove the residues. To date, lead dust remediation costs have not been material to our results of operations. We also monitor for airborne concentrations of lead in our buildings and are unaware of any significant lead concentrations in excess of the applicable OSHA or other local standards.\nWe have a range of corporate programs that aim to reduce the use of hazardous materials in manufacturing. We developed corporate-wide standardized environmental management systems, auditing programs and policies to enable better management of environmental compliance activities. For example, almost all of our manufacturing facilities are certified under ISO 14001, a set of standards and procedures relating to environmental compliance management. In addition, the electronics industry must adhere to the European Union's Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE). Parallel initiatives have been adopted in other jurisdictions throughout the world, including several states in the U.S. and the Peoples' Republic of China. RoHS limits the use of lead, mercury and other specified substances in electronics products. WEEE requires producers to assume responsibility for the collection, recycling and management of waste electronic products and components. We have implemented procedures intended to ensure our manufacturing processes are compliant with RoHS and the European Union's Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals (REACH) legislation, when required. WEEE compliance is primarily the responsibility of OEMs.\nAsbestos containing materials, or ACM, are present at several of our manufacturing facilities. Although ACM is being managed and controls have been put in place pursuant to ACM operations and maintenance plans, the presence of ACM could give rise to remediation obligations and other liabilities.\nOur facilities generally operate under environmental permits issued by governmental authorities. For the most part, these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws. Any such revocation may require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites, including those located in Owego, New York; Derry, New Hampshire; and Brockville, Ontario. In addition, we have been named in a lawsuit alleging operations at our current and former facilities in Orange County, California contributed to groundwater contamination, and also have ongoing investigation activities at and adjacent to a former facility to determine the extent of any soil, soil vapor, and groundwater contamination. Finally, there are some sites, including our acquired facility in Gunzenhausen, Germany, which are known to have groundwater contamination caused by a third-party, and that third-party has provided indemnification to us for the related liability. However, in certain situations, third-party indemnities may not be effective to reduce our liability for environmental contamination.\nWe use environmental consultants primarily for risk assessments and remediation, including remedial investigation and feasibility studies, remedial action planning and design and site remediation. Our consultants provide information regarding the nature and extent of site contamination, acceptable remediation alternatives and estimated costs associated with each remediation alternative. We consider their recommendations together with other information when determining the appropriate amount to accrue for environmental liabilities.\nOur capital expenditures for environmental control facilities were not material in any of the last three fiscal years and we do not expect to make material expenditures for this purpose during the current fiscal year.\nOther Regulations\nWe are also subject to a number of domestic and foreign regulations relating to our operations worldwide. In particular, our sales activities must comply with restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Asset Controls of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). We must also comply with regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense business, including regulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and many other aspects of performance under government contracts and subcontracts. These regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures in the form of additional personnel, systems and processes, and, in some cases, require us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations. Furthermore, our compliance with these regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities and, from time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. Finally, the design, manufacture and repair of products that we conduct for the medical industry often requires compliance with domestic and foreign regulations, including the Food and Drug Administrations (FDAs) quality system regulations and the European Unions medical device directive. In addition to complying with these standards, our medical facilities comply with ISO 13485 (formerly EN 46002) and ISO 9001, where required. Should we be found to have violated one or more of such regulations, we could become subject to civil damages (which in some cases can be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including fines, penalties, appointment of government monitors, termination of our government contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier.\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral Information About Our Human Capital Resources\nAs of October 1, 2022, we had approximately 34,000 employees and approximately 4,000 temporary employees, in 24 countries.\nRegion Approximate Breakdown of Employees\nAmericas 51 %\nAPAC 37 %\nEMEA 12 %\nTotal 100 %\nCore Principles\nAt Sanmina, we believe our employees are the key to our success. We cultivate an agile, innovative workplace culture fueled by collaboration, diversity, equity and inclusion. Having highly engaged employees is essential to our culture and achieving our mission. We embrace diverse perspectives and empower our employees to improve our organization, help us innovate, and continuously strengthen our workplace.\nAs a founding member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), the principles of the RBA are fundamental to our corporate culture and core values and are reflected in our commitments to our customers, stakeholders, employees and communities in which we do business around the world. We have aligned our work programs, processes and procedures to the RBA Code of Conduct to help ensure a safe and positive work environment for our employees that emphasizes learning and professional development, respect for individuals and ethical conduct, and that is facilitated by a direct management-employee engagement model.\nFor over a decade, we have tracked human capital metrics that we consider to be key to our business, including health and safety, career growth and development, turnover, hiring and diversity, equity and inclusion. Management regularly reviews these metrics and seeks to improve them.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. In the U.S., we are subject to the requirements of the United States Department of Labors Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) and we are guided by the Environmental Health and Safety principles as described in the RBAs Code of Conduct worldwide. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. Our ultimate goal is to achieve a level of work-related injuries as close to zero as possible through continuous investment in our safety programs. We provide protective gear (e.g. eye protection, masks and gloves) as required by applicable standards and as appropriate given employee job duties. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have invested heavily to help ensure the health of our employees. Through the use of education and awareness, provision of necessary PPE, and changes to our manufacturing sites and screening, we strive to make our workplaces a safe place for employees during the workday.\nCareer Growth and Development\nWe invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee performance and retaining our employees. We leverage both formal and informal programs, including in-person, virtual, social and self-directed learning, mentoring, coaching, and outside seminars and educational programs, when applicable, to identify, foster, and retain top talent. Employees have access to courses through our learning and development platforms including Pilgrim, Sanmina Online Education and Sanmina University.\nOur performance review process is intended to promote transparent communication of team member performance, which we believe is a key factor in our success. The performance reviews enable ongoing assessments, reviews, and mentoring to identify career development and learning opportunities for our employees. Our emphasis on employee retention, talent reviews, employee evaluations and succession planning contributed to a promotion rate of approximately 5% in 2022.\nTurnover\nWe continually monitor employee turnover rates, both regionally and as a whole, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained manufacturing and operating personnel. We believe the combination of competitive compensation, career growth and development opportunities have helped increase employee tenure and reduce voluntary turnover. The average tenure of our employees is approximately seven years and approximately 30% of our employees have been employed by us for more than ten years.\nHiring Practices\nWe recruit the best people for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAt Sanmina, we are focused on creating a culture of belonging where employees can be their authentic selves and cultivate a workplace where everyone has an opportunity to succeed. Recognizing and respecting our global presence, we strive to maintain a diverse, equitable and inclusive workforce everywhere we operate. Almost 50% of our employees worldwide are female and, in the U.S., non-Caucasian employees account for almost 55% of the employee base. Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are reflected in our employee training, in particular with respect to our policies against harassment and bullying and the elimination of bias in the workplace.\nManagement Engagement Practices\nWe believe in a direct management-employee engagement model by which managers and employees maintain a regular dialogue about working conditions, compensation, compliance with laws and applicable standards, safety and advancement opportunities. This model is also reflected in our training and compliance programs, which emphasize the need to report concerns about violations of policy or law. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. In some\ninternational locations, our employees are represented by labor unions on either a national or plant level or are subject to collective bargaining agreements.\nAvailable Information\nOur Internet address is http://www.sanmina.com. We make available through our website, free of charge, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.

Risk Factors\nEnd Market and Operational Risks\nWorldwide supply chain shortages caused by supply/demand imbalances, most notably in the semiconductor industry, the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical events are collectively limiting our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products, for which we have demand; our profitability will be reduced if we are unable to pass on increasing component costs.\nOur supply chain is being significantly impacted by a number of factors, including supply/demand imbalances, most notably in the semiconductor industry, interruptions in supplier and port operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic during a time when strong worldwide demand for electronic products and components has resumed and geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine. As a result, we are experiencing delays in delivery and shortages of certain components, particularly certain types of capacitors, resistors and discrete semiconductors needed for many of the products we manufacture. These conditions have limited our ability to manufacture and ship all of the products for which we have demand and that require these components and have resulted in an increase in our inventories of other components that cannot be assembled into finished products without these components. These factors are exacerbated by the fact that we are dependent on a number of limited and sole source suppliers to provide key components, which we incorporate into our products. We expect these delays and shortages to persist through at least the remainder of calendar year 2022 and that such shortages could result in delays in shipments to our customers during the period of such shortages. Any such delays would reduce our revenue, margins and operating cash flow for the periods affected.\nIn addition, inflationary pressures resulting from supply chain constraints and generally improved economic conditions are leading to sustained increases in the prices we pay for components and materials used in production and in our labor and transportation costs. While we seek to pass on to our customers the increased prices for components and shipping, plus a margin, our gross margins and profitability could decrease, perhaps significantly, over a sustained period of time if we are unable to do so.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition by reducing demand from our customers, interrupting the flow of components needed for our customers products, limiting the operations or productivity of our manufacturing facilities and creating health risks to our employees.\nOur business, operations and results of operations were significantly and negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two years. Among other impacts, the pandemic:\nResulted in the temporary closure of certain of our facilities;\nTemporarily reduced the amount of staffing at certain of our plants;\nRequired us in some cases to pay staff who are not able to work due to government orders or illness;\nLimited the capacity of logistics providers to deliver the components we use and ship the products we manufacture;\nReduced demand for certain of our customers products;\nResulted in interruptions in supply of components, either because our suppliers have themselves been prevented from operating or because major distribution channels (e.g. sea transport) were disrupted by the pandemic; and\nResulted in certain of our customers and suppliers experiencing financial difficulties, which could impact their ability or willingness to satisfy their payment or delivery obligations, respectively, to us in the future.\nAlthough conditions have improved in many of the regions in which we operate, we cannot predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to present risks to our business due to a large number of uncertainties, including the duration of ongoing supply chain constraints directly and indirectly caused by the pandemic, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers businesses, the number of our employees who may become infected, the continued efficacy and availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, the geographic locations of any future outbreaks, including outbreaks caused by variants of COVID-19, such as the Omicron variant of COVID-19 and its subvariants, and actions that government authorities may take in response. For example, China continues to maintain a zero tolerance policy towards COVID-19 infections, which has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our operations and our suppliers operations there. Thus, we believe that the pandemic could continue to have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nAdverse changes in the key end markets we target could harm our business by reducing our sales.\nWe provide products and services to companies that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure industries. Adverse changes in any of these end markets could reduce\ndemand for our customers products or make these customers more sensitive to the cost of our products and services, either of which could reduce our sales, gross margins and net income. A number of factors could affect these industries in general and our customers in particular, leading to reductions in net sales. These factors include:\nintense competition among our customers and their competitors, leading to reductions in prices for their products and increases in pricing pressure placed on us;\nfailure of our customers products to gain widespread commercial acceptance, which could decrease the volume of orders our customers place with us;\nchanges in regulatory requirements affecting the products we build for our customers, leading to product redesigns or obsolescence and potentially causing us to lose business; and\nthe negative effects of inflation and any potential resultant recession on customer demand.\nWe realize a substantial portion of our revenues from communications equipment customers. This market is highly competitive, particularly in the area of price. Should any of our larger customers in this market fail to effectively compete with their competitors, they could reduce their orders to us or experience liquidity difficulties, either of which could have the effect of substantially reducing our revenue and net income. There can be no assurance that we will not experience declines in demand in this or in other end markets in the future.\nOur operating results are subject to significant uncertainties, which can cause our future sales, net income and cash generated from operations to be variable.\nOur operating results can vary due to a number of significant uncertainties, including:\nour ability to replace declining sales from end-of-life programs and customer disengagements with new business wins;\nconditions in the global economy as a whole and in the industries we serve, which have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic;\nfluctuations in component prices, component shortages and extended component lead times caused by high demand and supply chain constraints, disruptions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, such as the war in Ukraine, natural disasters or otherwise;\ntiming and success of new product developments and ramps by our customers, which create demand for our services, but which can also require us to incur start-up costs relating to new tooling and processes;\nlevels of demand in the end markets served by our customers;\ntiming of orders from customers and the accuracy of their forecasts;\nour inventory levels, which have been driven higher as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions, with higher levels of inventory reducing our operating cash flow;\ncustomer payment terms and the extent to which we factor customer receivables during the quarter;\nincreasing labor costs in the regions in which we operate;\nmix of products ordered by and shipped to major customers, as high volume and low complexity manufacturing services typically have lower gross margins than more complex and lower volume services;\nour ability to pass tariffs and price increases of components through to our customers;\nresolution of quality or other claims made by our customers;\nthe degree to which we are able to fully utilize our available manufacturing capacity;\ncustomer insolvencies resulting in bad debt or inventory exposures that are in excess of our reserves;\nour ability to efficiently move manufacturing operations to lower cost regions when requested by our customers;\nchanges in our tax provision due to changes in our estimates of pre-tax income in the jurisdictions in which we operate, uncertain tax positions and our continued ability to utilize our deferred tax assets; and\npolitical and economic developments in countries in which we or our customers or our suppliers have operations, which could restrict our operations or those of our suppliers and/or customers or increase our costs.\nVariability in our operating results may also lead to variability in cash generated by operations, which can adversely affect our ability to make capital expenditures, engage in strategic transactions and repurchase stock.\nWe are subject to risks arising from our international operations.\nThe substantial majority of our net sales are generated through our non-U.S. operations. As a result, we are or can be negatively impacted by economic, political and other conditions in the foreign countries in which we do business, including:\nchanges in trade and tax laws that may result in us or our customers being subject to increased taxes, duties and tariffs and import and export restrictions, which could increase our costs and/or reduce our customers willingness to use our services in countries in which we are currently manufacturing their products;\ncompliance with foreign laws, including labor laws that generally provide for increased notice, severance and consultation requirements compared to U.S. labor laws;\nlabor unrest, including strikes;\ndifficulties in staffing due to immigration or travel restrictions imposed by national governments, including the U.S.;\nsecurity concerns;\npolitical instability and/or regional military tension or hostilities, such as the war in Ukraine, the possibility of such conflict broadening to areas outside of Ukraine, and the actions taken by national governments in response to such hostilities, such as sanctions and export bans;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may either increase or decrease our operating costs and for which we have significant exposure;\nthe imposition of currency controls, which would have the effect of preventing us from repatriating profits from our foreign subsidiaries;\nexposure to heightened corruption risks;\naggressive, selective or lax enforcement of laws and regulations by national governmental authorities; and\npotentially increased risk of misappropriation of intellectual property.\nWe operate in countries that have experienced labor unrest, political instability or conflict and strife in the past, including China, India, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico and Thailand, and we have experienced work stoppages and similar disruptions at our plants in these countries. To the extent these factors prevent us from adequately staffing our plants and manufacturing and shipping products in those jurisdictions, our margins and net income could be reduced and our reputation as a reliable supplier could be negatively impacted.\nWe rely on a relatively small number of customers for a substantial portion of our sales, and declines in sales to these customers could significantly reduce our net sales and net income.\nSales to our ten largest customers have historically represented approximately half of our net sales. We expect to continue to depend upon a relatively small number of customers for a significant percentage of our sales for the foreseeable future. The loss of, a significant reduction in sales or pricing to, or an inability to recover components liabilities from our largest customers could therefore substantially reduce our revenue and margins.\nCurrent U.S. trade policy could increase the cost of using both our onshore and offshore manufacturing services for our U.S. customers, leading them to reduce their orders to us.\nAlthough we maintain significant manufacturing capacity in the U.S., the majority of our manufacturing operations are located outside the U.S. The U.S., China, the E.U. and several other countries have imposed tariffs on certain imported products. In particular, the U.S. has imposed tariffs impacting certain components and products imported from China by us into the U.S. These tariffs apply to both components imported into the U.S. from China for use in the manufacture of products at our U.S. plants and to certain of our customers products that we manufacture for them in China and that are then imported into the U.S. Any decision by a large number of our customers to cease using our manufacturing services due to the application of tariffs would materially reduce our revenue and net income. In addition, our gross margins would be reduced in the event we are for any reason unable to pass on any tariffs that we incurred to our customers. Although our customers are generally liable for tariffs we pay on their behalf on importation of components used in the manufacture of their products, our gross margins would be reduced in the event we were for any reason unable to recover tariffs or duties from our customers. Further, although we are required to pay tariffs upon importation of the components, we may not be able to recover these amounts from customers until sometime later, if at all, which would adversely impact our operating cash flow in a given period.\nCustomer order cancellations, push-outs and reduced forecasts could reduce our sales, net income and liquidity.\nWe generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers and our bookings may generally be canceled prior to the scheduled shipment date. Although customers are generally liable for components we procure on their behalf, finished goods and work-in-process at the time of cancellation, customers may fail to honor this commitment or we may be unable or, for other business reasons, choose not to enforce our contractual rights. Cancellations, reductions or push-outs of orders by customers and reduced customer forecasts customers could cause our inventory levels to increase, consuming working capital, lead to write-offs of inventory that customers fail to purchase for any reason and reduce our sales, net income and liquidity.\nOur strategy to pursue higher margin business depends in part on the success of our CPS businesses, which, if not successful, could cause our future gross margins and operating results to be lower.\nA key part of our strategy to capitalize on our ability to provide end-to-end manufacturing solutions is to grow our Components, Products and Services (CPS) businesses, which supplies printed circuit boards, backplane and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts, memory, RF, optical and microelectronic solutions, and data storage solutions and design, engineering, logistics and repair services and our SCI defense and aerospace products. A decrease in orders for these components, products and services can have a disproportionately adverse impact on our profitability since these components, products and services generally carry higher than average contribution margins than our core IMS business. In addition, in order to grow this portion of our business profitably, we must continually make substantial investments in the development of our product development capabilities, research and development activities, test and tooling equipment and skilled personnel, all of which reduce our operating results in the short term. The success of our CPS businesses also depends on our ability to increase sales of our proprietary products, convince our customers to purchase our components rather than those of third parties for use in the manufacture of their products, and expand the number of our customers who contract for our design, engineering, logistics and repair services. We may face challenges in achieving commercially viable yields and difficulties in manufacturing components in the quantities and to the specifications and quality standards required by our customers, as well as in qualifying our components for use in our customers designs. Our proprietary products and design, engineering, logistics and repair services must compete with products and services offered by established vendors which focus solely on development of similar technologies or the provision of similar services. Any of these factors could reduce the revenue and margins of our CPS businesses, which in turn would have an adverse and potentially disproportionate effect on our overall revenues and profitability.\nCustomer requirements to transfer business may increase our costs.\nOur customers sometimes require that we transfer the manufacturing of their products from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions, tariff reductions and other objectives. These transfers have resulted in increased costs to us due to facility downtime, less than optimal utilization of our manufacturing capacity and delays and complications related to the transition of manufacturing programs to new locations. These transfers, and any decision by a significant customer to terminate manufacturing services in a particular facility, could require us to close or reduce operations at certain facilities and, as a result, we may incur in the future significant costs for the closure of facilities, employee severance and related matters. We may be required to relocate additional manufacturing operations in the future and, accordingly, we may incur additional costs that decrease our net income.\nTransfers of our operations to other facilities caused by lease terminations could cause disruptions in our ability to service our customers\nCertain of our foreign manufacturing facilities are leased from third parties. To the extent we are unable to renew the leases covering such facilities as they expire on reasonable terms, or are forced to move our operations at those facilities to other locations as a result of a failure to agree upon renewal terms, production for our customers may be interrupted, we may breach our customer agreements, we could incur significant start-up costs at new facilities and our lease expense may increase, potentially significantly.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. export control and other regulatory requirements, with which the failure to comply could result in fines and reduction of future revenue.\nWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to the export of U.S. technology, anti-corruption and the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts. In particular, our activities must comply with the restrictions relating to the export of controlled technology and sales to denied or sanctioned parties contained in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and sanctions administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Treasury Department (OFAC). The U.S. Commerce Department recently released rules that in some cases significantly restrict the export of U.S. technology to or from China. These laws could negatively impact our operations in China by making it more difficult to import components containing U.S. technology into China and to export finished products containing such components out of China. Any failure to comply with export control laws could result in significant fines or penalties. We must also comply with regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts and subcontracts with respect to our defense business, including regulations that govern price negotiations, cost accounting standards, procurement practices, termination at the election of the government and many other aspects of performance under government contracts and subcontracts. These laws and regulations are complex, require extensive compliance efforts and expenditures in the form of additional systems and personnel, and, in some cases,\nrequire us to ensure that our suppliers adhere to such regulations. Furthermore, our compliance with such regulations is subject to audit or investigation by governmental authorities. From time to time, we receive formal and informal inquiries from government agencies and regulators regarding our compliance. Should we be found to have violated one or more of such laws or regulations, we could become subject to civil damages (which in some cases could be trebled) or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including appointment of government monitors, termination of our government contracts and, ultimately, debarment from doing further business with the U.S. government. Any of such results would increase our expenses, reduce our revenue and damage our reputation as both a commercial and government supplier.\nIf we manufacture or design defective products, if there are manufacturing defects in the components we incorporate into customer products or if our manufacturing processes do not comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards, we could be subject to claims, damages and fines and lose customers.\nWe manufacture products to our customers specifications, and in some cases our manufacturing processes and facilities need to comply with various statutory and regulatory requirements and standards. For example, many of the medical products that we manufacture, as well as the facilities and manufacturing processes that we use to produce them, must comply with standards established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and products we manufacture for the automotive end market are generally subject to the IATF 16949:2016 standard. In addition, our customers products and the manufacturing processes that we use to produce them often are highly complex. As a result, products that we design or manufacture may at times contain design or manufacturing defects, and our manufacturing processes may be subject to errors or may not be in compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards. Finally, customer products can experience quality problems or failures as a result of defects in the components they specify to be included in the products we manufacture for them. Defects in the products we design or manufacture, even if caused by components specified by the customer, may result in product recalls, warranty claims by customers, including liability for repair costs, delayed shipments to customers or reduced or canceled customer orders. The failure of the products that we design or manufacture or of our manufacturing processes and facilities to comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and standards may subject us to legal fines or penalties, cause us to lose business and, in some cases, require us to shut down or incur considerable expense to correct a manufacturing program or facility. In addition, these defects may result in product liability claims against us by third parties. The risk and magnitude of such claims may increase as we continue to expand our presence in the medical and automotive end markets since defects in these types of products can result in death or significant injury to end users of these products. Even when our customers are contractually responsible for defects in the design of a product and defects in components used in the manufacture of such products, there is no guarantee that these customers will have the financial resources to indemnify us for such liabilities and we could nonetheless be required to expend significant resources to defend ourselves if named in a product liability suit over such defects.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, upon the intellectual property of others, we could be required to pay significant amounts in costs or damages.\nWe rely on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property rights. However, a number of our patents covering certain aspects of our manufacturing processes or products have expired and will continue to expire in the future. Such expirations reduce our ability to assert claims against competitors or others who use or sell similar technology. Any inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our proprietary technology. In addition, should a current or former employee use or disclose any of our or our customers proprietary information, we could become subject to legal action by our customers or others, our key technologies could become compromised and our ability to compete could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, we may become involved in administrative proceedings, lawsuits or other proceedings if others allege that the products we manufacture for our customers or our own manufacturing processes and products infringe on their intellectual property rights. If successful, such claims could force our customers and us to stop importing or producing products or components of products that use the challenged intellectual property, to pay up to treble damages and to obtain a license to the relevant technology or to redesign those products or services so as not to use the infringed technology. The costs of defense and potential damages and/or impact on production of patent litigation could be significant and have a materially adverse impact on our financial results. In addition, although our customers typically indemnify us against claims that the products we manufacture for them infringe others intellectual property rights, there is no guaranty that these customers will have the financial resources to stand behind such indemnities should the need arise, nor is there any guarantee that any such indemnity could be fully enforced. We sometimes design products on a contract basis or jointly with our customers. In such situations, we may become subject to claims that products we design infringe third party intellectual property rights and may also be required to indemnify our customer against liability caused by such claims.\nAny of these events could reduce our revenue, increase our costs and damage our reputation with our customers.\nAllegations of failures to comply with domestic or international employment and related laws could result in the payment of significant damages, which would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to a variety of domestic and foreign employment laws, including those related to safety, wages and overtime, discrimination, harassment, organizing, whistleblowing, classification of employees, privacy and severance payments. We may be required to defend against allegations that we have violated such laws. Allegations that we have violated labor laws could lead to damages being awarded to employees or fines from or settlements with plaintiffs or federal, state or foreign regulatory authorities, the amounts of which could be substantial, and which would reduce our net income. For example, in the first quarter of 2022, we paid approximately $4 million in a judicially approved settlement in connection with a lawsuit against the Company alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, wages, wage statements and reimbursements of business expenses.\nCyberattacks and other disruptions of our information technology network and systems could interrupt our operations, lead to loss of our customer and employee data and subject us to damages.\nWe rely on internal and cloud-based networks and systems furnished by third parties for worldwide financial reporting, inventory management, procurement, invoicing, employee payroll and benefits administration and email communications, among other functions. In addition, our 42Q manufacturing execution solutions software used by us and certain of our customers operates in the cloud. Despite our business continuity planning, including maintaining redundant data sites and network availability, both our internal and cloud-based infrastructure may be susceptible to outages due to fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. In addition, despite the implementation of numerous network security measures, both our internal and our cloud-based infrastructure may also be vulnerable to hacking, computer viruses, the installation of malware and similar disruptions either by third parties or employees with access to key IT infrastructure. Cybersecurity attacks can come in many forms, including distributed denial of service attacks, advanced persistent threat, phishing, business email compromise efforts and ransomware attacks. Recently, a cyberattack involving malware delivered through network monitoring software sold by SolarWinds resulted in the penetration of the systems of a multitude of governmental and commercial entities. While we were not affected by this cyberattack, there can be no assurance that a future malware attack will not be successful in breaching our systems. Hacking, malware and other cybersecurity attacks, if not prevented, could lead to the collection and disclosure of sensitive personal or confidential information relating to our customers, employees or others, exposing us to legal liability and causing us to suffer reputational damage. In addition, our SCI defense and aerospace business is subject to U.S. government regulations requiring the safeguarding of certain unclassified government information and to report to the U.S. government certain cyber incidents that affect such information. The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks requires us to continually evaluate new technologies and processes intended to detect and prevent these attacks. Our insurance coverage for cyberattacks is limited. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity measures will be sufficient to protect the data we manage. If we and our cloud infrastructure vendors are not successful in preventing such outages and cyberattacks, our operations could be disrupted, we could incur losses, including losses relating to claims by our customers, employees or privacy regulators relating to loss of personal or confidential business information, the willingness of customers to do business with us may be damaged and, in the case of our defense business, we could be barred from future participation in U.S. government programs.\nGlobal, national and corporate initiatives addressing climate change could increase our costs.\nConcern over climate change may lead to state, federal and international legislative and regulatory initiatives aimed at reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions through incentives, taxes or mandates and there is increased stockholder interest generally in voluntary corporate commitments to reduce the generation of greenhouse gases. Collectively, such initiatives and commitments could lead to an increase in both the price of energy and our operating costs. A sustained increase in energy prices for any reason could increase our raw material, components, operations and transportation costs, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers and which would therefore reduce our profitability, as would increased operating costs and investments due to our adoption, whether voluntary or mandatory, of measures to reduce our carbon footprint. We could also suffer reputational damage if our sustainability practices are perceived to be inadequate.\nAny failure to comply with applicable environmental laws could adversely affect our business by causing us to pay significant amounts for cleanup of hazardous materials or for damages or fines.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations, including those governing the use, generation, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous substances and waste in the ordinary course of our manufacturing operations. If we violate environmental laws or if we own or operate, or owned or operated in the past, a site at which we or a predecessor company caused contamination, we may be held liable for damages and the costs of remedial\nactions. For example, in June 2022, a court issued a tentative ruling finding us liable for certain investigation costs relating to a site owned by a predecessor company in Southern California at which a disposal was alleged to have occurred. Although we estimate and regularly reassess our potential liability with respect to violations or alleged violations and accrue for such liability, our accruals may not be sufficient. Any increase in existing reserves or establishment of new reserves for environmental liability would reduce our net income. Our failure or inability to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could also limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations.\nPartly as a result of certain of our acquisitions, we have incurred liabilities associated with environmental contamination. These liabilities include ongoing investigation and remediation activities at a number of current and former sites. The time required to perform environmental remediation can be lengthy and there can be no assurance that the scope, and therefore cost, of these activities will not increase as a result of the discovery of new contamination or contamination on adjoining landowners properties or the adoption of more stringent regulatory standards covering sites at which we are currently performing remediation activities.\nWe cannot assure that past disposal activities will not result in liability that will materially affect us in the future, nor can we provide assurance that we do not have environmental exposures of which we are unaware and which could adversely affect our future operating results. Changes in or restrictions on discharge limits, emissions levels, permitting requirements and material storage or handling could require a higher than anticipated level of remediation activities, operating expenses and capital investment or, depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors, costly plant relocation, any of which would reduce our net income.\nChanges in financial accounting standards or policies have affected, and in the future may affect, our reported financial condition or results of operations; there are inherent limitations to our system of internal controls; changes in corporate governance policies and practices may impact our business.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). The preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the recorded amounts of assets, liabilities and net income during the reporting period. A change in the facts and circumstances surrounding those estimates could result in a change to our estimates and could impact our future operating results. GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create accounting policies. A change in those policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions which are completed before a change is announced. For example, in fiscal 2019, we implemented the new revenue recognition standard, which is complex and requires significant management judgment. Although we believe the judgments we applied in implementation of the new revenue recognition standard are appropriate, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to change our judgments relating to implementation of such standard in the future, whether as a result of new guidance or otherwise. A significant change in our accounting judgments could have a significant impact on our reported revenue, gross profit, assets and liabilities. In general, changes to accounting rules or challenges to our interpretation or application of the rules by regulators may have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results or on the way we conduct business.\nOur system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. As a result, there can be no assurance that our system of internal and disclosure controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors, theft and fraud, or in informing management of all material information in a timely manner.\nFinally, corporate governance, public disclosure and compliance practices continue to evolve based upon continuing legislative action, SEC rulemaking and policy positions taken by large institutional stockholders and proxy advisors. As a result, the number of rules, regulations and standards applicable to us may become more burdensome to comply with, could increase scrutiny of our practices and policies by these or other groups and increase our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time management must devote to governance and compliance activities. For example, the SEC has recently proposed rules requiring that issuers provide significantly increased disclosures concerning cybersecurity matters and the impact of climate changes on their business. Increasing regulatory burdens and corporate governance requirements could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board of Directors and qualified executive officers.\nLiquidity and Credit Risks\nOur customers could experience credit problems, which could reduce our future revenues and net income.\nCertain of our customers have experienced significant financial difficulties in the past, with a few filing for bankruptcy. Financial difficulties experienced by one or more of our customers, could negatively affect our business by decreasing demand from such customers and through the potential inability of these companies to make full payment on amounts owed to us. Customer bankruptcies also entail the risk of potential recovery by the bankruptcy estate of amounts previously paid to us that are deemed a preference under bankruptcy laws. There can be no assurance that additional customers will not declare bankruptcy or suffer financial distress, in which case our future revenues, net income and cash flow could be reduced.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient liquidity to maintain or expand our operations, which would reduce the amount of business our customers and vendors are able to do with us and impact our ability to continue operations at current levels without seeking additional funding; we could experience losses if one or more financial institutions holding our cash or other financial counterparties were to fail; repatriation of foreign cash could increase our taxes.\nOur liquidity is dependent on a number of factors, including profitability, business volume, inventory requirements, the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, the degree of alignment of payment terms from our suppliers with payment terms granted to our customers, the amount we invest in our facilities and equipment, the timing of acquisitions and divestitures, the schedule for repayment of our outstanding indebtedness, the timing of stock repurchases, availability under the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of September 27, 2022, as amended (the Amended Cash Flow Revolver), and the amount of accounts receivable eligible for sale under our factoring programs. In the event we need or desire additional liquidity beyond the sources described above to maintain or expand our business levels, make acquisitions or repurchase stock, there can be no assurance that such additional liquidity will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Any failure to maintain adequate liquidity would prevent us from maintaining operations at current or desired levels, which in turn would reduce both our revenue and profitability.\nAlthough we believe our existing cash resources and sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next 12 months, should demand for our services increase significantly over the next 12 months or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, including in particular worsening economic conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our cash provided by operations could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level. In such a case, there can be no assurance that such additional sources of financing would be available.\nA principal source of our liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents, which are held with various financial institutions. Although we distribute such funds among a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost. Finally, if one or more counterparties to our interest rate or foreign currency hedging instruments were to fail, we could suffer losses and our hedging of risk could become less effective.\nApproximately 50% of our cash is held in foreign jurisdictions. Some of these jurisdictions restrict the amount of cash that can be transferred to the U.S. or impose taxes and penalties on such transfers of cash. To the extent we have excess cash in foreign locations that could be used in, or is needed by, our U.S. operations, we may incur significant foreign taxes to repatriate these funds which would reduce the net amount ultimately available for such purposes.\nOur Amended Cash Flow Revolver contains covenants that may adversely impact our business; the failure to comply with such covenants or the occurrence of an event of default could cause us to be unable to borrow additional funds and cause our outstanding debt to become immediately payable.\nOur Amended Cash Flow Revolver contains a maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12-month look-back period, and a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions, with which we must comply. Collectively, these covenants could constrain our ability to grow our business through acquisition or engage in other strategic transactions. Such facility also contains customary events of default, including that a material business interruption or cessation has not occurred. Finally, such facility includes covenants requiring, among other things, that we file quarterly and annual financial statements with the SEC, comply with all laws, pay all taxes and maintain casualty insurance. If we are not able to comply with these covenants or if an event of default were to occur and not be\ncured, all of our outstanding debt would become immediately due and payable and the incurrence of additional debt under our Amended Cash Flow Revolver would not be allowed, either of which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to continue to conduct our business.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are subject to intense competition in the EMS industry, which could cause us to lose sales and, therefore, harm our financial performance.\nThe EMS industry is highly competitive and the industry has experienced a surplus of manufacturing capacity. Our competitors include major global EMS providers, including Benchmark Electronics, Inc., Celestica, Inc., Flex Ltd., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd. (Foxconn), Jabil Circuit, Inc. and Plexus Corp., as well as other companies that have a regional, product, service or industry-specific focus. We also face competition from current and potential OEM customers who may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather than outsourcing to EMS providers.\nCompetition is based on a number of factors, including end markets served, price and quality. We may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors for any number of reasons, including the willingness of competitors to provide EMS services at prices we are unable or unwilling to offer. There can be no assurance that we will win new business or maintain existing business due to competitive factors, which could decrease our sales and net income. In addition, due to the extremely price sensitive nature of our industry, business that we do win or maintain may have lower margins than our historical or target margins. As a result, competition may cause our gross and operating margins to fall.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry may adversely affect our business by increasing customer buying power and increasing prices we pay for components.\nConsolidation in the electronics industry among our customers, our suppliers and/or our competitors may increase, which could result in a small number of very large electronics companies offering products in multiple sectors of the electronics industry. If one of our customers is acquired by another company that does not rely on us to provide EMS services, we may lose that customers business. Similarly, consolidation among our suppliers could result in a sole or limited source for certain components used in our customers products. Any such consolidation could cause us to be required to pay increased prices for such components, which could reduce our gross margin and profitability if we are unable to pass on the corresponding cost to our customers.\nUnanticipated changes in our income tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities could increase our taxes and decrease our net income; our projections of future taxable income that drove the release of our valuation allowance in prior years could prove to be incorrect, which could cause a charge to earnings.\nWe are or may become subject to income, sales, value-added, goods and services, withholding and other taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for taxes and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective income tax rates and liability for other taxes could increase as a result of changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in enacted tax laws, the effectiveness of our cash and tax management strategies, our ability to negotiate advance pricing agreements with foreign tax authorities, compliance with local trade laws and other factors. International initiatives require multinational enterprises, like ours, to report profitability on a country-by-country basis, which could increase scrutiny by foreign tax authorities. In addition, our tax determinations are regularly subject to audit by tax authorities. For example, we are currently undergoing audits of our tax returns for certain recent tax years in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. Developments in these or future audits could adversely affect our tax provisions, including through the disallowance or reduction of deferred tax assets or the assessment of back taxes, interest and penalties, any of which could result in an increase to income tax expense and therefore a decrease in our net income.\nWe can experience losses due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls, which could reduce our net income and impact our ability to repatriate funds.\nBecause we manufacture and sell the majority of our products abroad, our operating results can be negatively impacted due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly in volatile currencies to which we are exposed, such as the Euro, Mexican peso, Malaysian ringgit and Chinese renminbi. We use financial instruments, primarily short-term foreign currency forward contracts, to hedge our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. However, the success of our foreign currency hedging activities in preventing foreign exchange losses depends largely upon the accuracy of our forecasts of future sales,\nexpenses, capital expenditures and assets and liabilities. As such, our foreign currency hedging program may not fully cover all of our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. If our hedging activities are not successful, our net income may be reduced. In addition, certain countries in which we operate have adopted currency controls requiring that local transactions be settled only in local currency rather than in our functional currency, which is generally different than the local currency. Such controls could require us to hedge larger amounts of local currency than we otherwise would and/or prevent us from repatriating cash generated by our operations in such countries.\nWe may not have sufficient insurance coverage for potential claims and losses, which could leave us responsible for certain costs and damages.\nWe carry various forms of business and liability insurance in types and amounts we believe are reasonable and customary for similarly situated companies in our industry. However, our insurance program does not generally cover losses due to failure to comply with typical customer warranties for workmanship, product and medical device liability, intellectual property infringement, product recall claims, or environmental contamination. In particular, our insurance coverage with respect to damages to or closure of our facilities, or damages to our customers products caused by cyberattacks and certain natural disasters, such as earthquakes, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), is limited and is subject to policy deductibles, coverage limits, and exclusions, and as a result, may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses. For example, our policies have very limited coverage for damages due to earthquakes or losses caused by business disruptions. In addition, such coverage may not continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms. Our policies generally have deductibles and/or limits or may be limited to certain lines or business or customer engagements that reduce the amount of our potential recoveries from insurance. As a result, not all of our potential business losses are covered under our insurance policies. Should we sustain a significant uncovered loss, our net income will be reduced. Additionally, if one or more counterparties to our insurance coverage were to fail, we would bear the entire amount of an otherwise insured loss.\nRecruiting and retaining our key personnel is critical to the continued growth of our business.\nOur success depends upon the continued service of our key personnel, particularly our highly skilled sales and operations executives, managers and engineers with many years of experience in the EMS industry. Such individuals can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain and are heavily recruited by our competitors. As our key employees choose to retire or terminate their employment with us, we will be required to replace them with new employees with the required experience. This has become more difficult in the U.S. recently due to the strong employment market. Should we be unable to recruit new employees to fill key positions with us, our operations and growth prospects could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not be successful in implementing and integrating strategic transactions or in divesting assets or businesses, which could harm our operating results; we could become required to book a charge to earnings should we determine that goodwill and other acquired assets are impaired.\nFrom time to time, we may undertake strategic transactions that give us the opportunity to access new customers and new end markets, increase our proprietary product offerings, obtain new manufacturing and service capabilities and technologies, enter new geographic manufacturing locations, lower our manufacturing costs, increase our margins or further develop existing customer relationships. Strategic transactions involve a number of risks, uncertainties and costs, including integrating acquired operations and workforce, businesses and products, resolving quality issues involving acquired products, incurring severance and other restructuring costs, diverting management attention from their normal operational duties, maintaining customer, supplier or other favorable business relationships of acquired operations, terminating unfavorable commercial arrangements, losing key employees, integrating the systems of acquired operations into our management information systems and satisfying the liabilities of acquired businesses, including liability for past violations of law and material environmental liabilities. Any of these risks could cause our strategic transactions not to be ultimately profitable. We may also choose to divest plants, businesses or products lines in the future. Divestitures reduce revenue and, potentially, margins and can involve the risk of retained liabilities from the operations divested, including environmental liabilities.\nIn addition, we have in the past recorded, and may be required to record in the future, goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions. We evaluate, at least on an annual basis, whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. Should we determine in the future that our goodwill or other intangible assets have become impaired, an impairment charge to earnings would become necessary, which could be significant. For example, during our fiscal 2018 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we fully impaired goodwill of $31 million associated with the acquisition of a storage software business we purchased in 2016.\nWe are subject to risks associated with natural disasters and global events.\nOur activities, including manufacturing, administration and information technology management, can be adversely affected by natural disasters such as major earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, tornadoes, fires and epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Climate change may cause these events to become more severe and therefore more damaging. In the event of a major natural disaster affecting one or more of our facilities, our operations and management information systems, which control our worldwide procurement, inventory management, shipping and billing activities, could be significantly disrupted. Such events could delay or prevent product manufacturing for an extended period of time. Any extended inability to continue our operations at affected facilities following such an event could reduce our revenue.\nRisks of Investing in Our Stock\nThe market price of our common stock is volatile and is impacted by factors other than our financial performance.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected our stock price. These fluctuations have often been unrelated to our operating performance. Factors that can cause such fluctuations include announcements by our customers, suppliers, competitors or other events affecting companies in the electronics industry, such as component shortages, currency fluctuations, the impact of natural disasters and global events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, such as the war in Ukraine, general market fluctuations and macroeconomic conditions, including concerns about inflation and recession, any of which may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate widely. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nFacilities. Our customers sell their products throughout the world and therefore need access to manufacturing services globally. For this reason, we maintain facilities both near our major customers and their end markets and also in lower cost locations, including Latin America, Eastern Europe, China, India and Southeast Asia. Many of our plants located near customers or their end markets are focused primarily on new product introduction and high-level assembly and test, and plants located in lower cost areas are engaged primarily in higher volume, less complex component and subsystem manufacturing and assembly.\nWe continually evaluate our global manufacturing operations and adjust our facilities and operations to keep our manufacturing capacity in line with demand and our manufacturing strategy and to provide cost efficient services to our customers. As a result, we have closed certain facilities not required to satisfy current demand levels in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nAs of October 1, 2022, the approximate square footage of our active manufacturing facilities by region was as follows:\nApproximate\nSquare Footage\nAmericas 5,717,385\nAPAC 3,938,308\nEMEA 1,640,780\nTotal 11,296,473\nAs of October 1, 2022, our active manufacturing facilities consist of nine million square feet in facilities that we own and two million square feet in leased facilities with lease terms expiring between 2022 and 2042.\nWe regularly evaluate our expected future facilities requirements and believe our existing facilities are adequate to meet our requirements for the next 12 months.\nCertifications and Registrations. Certifications and registrations under industry standards are important to our business because many customers rely on them to confirm our adherence to manufacturing process and quality standards. Certain markets, such as telecommunications, medical, defense, aerospace, automotive and oil and gas, require adherence to industry-specific standards. Substantially all of our manufacturing facilities are certified to ISO 9001:2015, a standard published by the International Organization for Standardization. As part of the ISO 9001:2015 certification process, we have a highly developed quality management system and continually improve its effectiveness in accordance with its requirements. We use this certification to demonstrate our ability to consistently provide product that meets customer and applicable regulatory requirements and enhance customer satisfaction through its effective application.\nIn addition to ISO 9001:2015, many of our facilities are TL 9000 6.3 certified. The TL 9000 quality system requirements and quality system metrics are designed specifically for the telecommunications industry to promote consistency and efficiency, reduce redundancy and improve customer satisfaction. Included in the TL 9000 system are performance-based metrics that quantify reliability and quality performance of the product. The majority of our facilities are also compliant with the standards set by Underwriters Laboratories (UL). These standards define requirements for quality, manufacturing process control and manufacturing documentation and are required by many OEMs in the communications sector of the electronics industry.\nOur medical systems division has identified certain manufacturing facilities to be centers of excellence for medical products manufacturing. These facilities are ISO 13485:2016 certified and, where appropriate, FDA registered and MDSAP certified. All such facilities are fully compliant with the FDA's quality systems regulations.\nOur defense and aerospace operations are headquartered in Huntsville, Alabama in a facility dedicated to meeting the specialized needs of our defense and aerospace customers. These defense and aerospace operations are AS9100 2016 certified and maintain other certifications in accordance with various U.S. military specifications, ANSI and other standards as appropriate for defense and aerospace suppliers. Other selected operations around the world are also AS9100 Rev. D certified.\nOur automotive facilities are strategically located worldwide. Substantially all of our automotive facilities are certified to IATF16949:2016, the automotive industry standard.\nOur oil and gas related manufacturing operations are, as applicable, certified to American Petroleum Institute (API) requirements. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nIn June 2008, we were named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor companys actions at a plant we sold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint seeks recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory relief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against us were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the Superior Court of California for trial. The first phase of a multi-phase trial commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence concluded in May 2022. On June 28, 2022, the Court issued a tentative ruling finding Sanmina and the other defendants liable for certain past investigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. A final statement of decision in this phase of the trial is expected on or about the middle of calendar year 2023. Based upon the Courts tentative ruling, we believe a loss in this matter is probable and have recorded an estimated loss. Subsequent trial phases to assess Sanminas and certain other defendants liability for the plaintiffs future remediation and other costs, and the allocation of damages among the liable defendants, are anticipated to occur in 2024 and beyond. It is probable that we will record additional losses in connection with this matter, and it is reasonably possible that the amount of such additional losses will be material. However, at the current time, we are unable to estimate the amount of such additional losses or a range of losses. We intend to continue defending the case vigorously and to seek appellate review of any adverse liability rulings or judgment at the appropriate time.\nOn December 20, 2019, we sued our former customer, Dialight plc (Dialight), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to collect approximately $10 million in unpaid accounts receivable and net obsolete inventory obligations. Later the same day, Dialight commenced its own action in the same court. Dialights complaint, which asserts claims for fraudulent inducement, breach of contract and gross negligence/willful misconduct, alleges that we fraudulently misrepresented our capabilities to induce Dialight to enter into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (Dialight MSA), and then breached our obligations under the Dialight MSA relating to quality, on-time delivery and supply chain management. Dialight seeks compensatory and punitive damages that it contends exceed $200 million, but which we believe are vastly overstated and subject to a contractual limitation of liability that limits any Dialight recovery to less than $2 million. We continue to vigorously prosecute our claims against Dialight. Further, we strongly disagree with Dialights allegations and are defending against them vigorously. No trial date has been set in this matter.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may become involved in routine legal proceedings, demands, claims, threatened litigation and regulatory inquiries and investigations that arise in the normal course of our business. We record liabilities for such matters when a loss becomes probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and unfavorable outcomes could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us as a result of incurrence of litigation costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nSee also Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5.

Our revenue is generated from sales of our products and services primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud solutions industries.\nOur operations are managed as two businesses:\n1) Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS). Our IMS segment consists of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.\n2) Components, Products and Services (CPS). Components include printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions (VES) division; optical, radio frequency (RF) and microelectronic (microE) design and manufacturing services from Advanced Microsystems Technologies; defense and aerospace products from SCI Technology; and cloud-based manufacturing execution software from our 42Q division. Services include design, engineering and logistics and repair.\nOur only reportable segment for financial reporting purposes is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of our total revenue in 2022. Our CPS business consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled Components, Products and Services.\nAll references in this section to years refer to our fiscal years ending on the Saturday nearest to September 30. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were each 52-weeks and fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, with the extra week occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nOur strategy is to leverage our comprehensive product and service offerings, advanced technologies and global capabilities to further penetrate diverse end markets that we believe offer significant growth opportunities and have complex products that require higher value-added services. We believe this strategy differentiates us from our competitors and will help drive more sustainable revenue growth and provide opportunities for us to ultimately achieve operating margins that exceed industry standards.\nThere are many challenges to successfully executing our strategy. For example, we compete with a number of companies in each of our key end markets. This includes companies that are much larger than we are and smaller companies that focus on a particular niche. Although we believe we are well-positioned in each of our key end markets and seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors, competition remains intense and profitably growing our revenues has been challenging. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic created a unique and challenging environment in which our revenue and profitability in 2021 and 2020 were significantly and negatively impacted. These impacts arose from rapidly changing market and economic conditions caused by the pandemic, as well as by numerous measures imposed by government authorities to try to limit the spread of the virus. These conditions and measures disrupted our operations and those of our customers, interrupted the supply of components, reduced the capacity of our logistics providers to deliver the components we use and ship the products we manufacture and resulted in temporary closures of manufacturing sites and reduced staffing of our plants. Although conditions have improved in many of the regions in which we operate, we cannot predict when the COVID-19 pandemic will cease to present risks to our business due to a large number of uncertainties, including the duration of ongoing supply chain constraints directly and indirectly caused by the pandemic, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our customers businesses, the number of employees who may become infected or exposed to infected persons, the need for temporary plant closures caused by large scale employee infections, the duration of the outbreak, the continued efficacy and availability of COVID-19 vaccines, the geographic locations of any future outbreaks, including outbreaks caused by variants of COVID-19, such as the Omicron variant and its subvariants, and actions that government authorities may take in response. For example, China continues to maintain a zero tolerance policy towards COVID-19 infections, which has disrupted and could continue to disrupt our operations and our suppliers operations there. Thus, we believe the pandemic and related supply chain disruptions could continue to have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future.\nSeparately, over the past three years, we incurred restructuring charges of $31 million under our company-wide restructuring plan adopted in October 2019 (Q1 FY20 Plan). These charges consist primarily of severance. Substantially all cash payments have occurred.\nSales to our ten largest customers typically represent approximately 50% of our net sales in any given year. Sales to Nokia and Motorola each represented 10% or more of our net sales in 2022. Nokia represented 10% or more of our net sales in 2021 and 2020.\nWe typically generate about 80% of our net sales from products manufactured in our foreign operations. The concentration of foreign operations has resulted primarily from a desire on the part of many of our customers to manufacture in lower cost locations in regions such as Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe.\nHistorically, we have had substantial recurring sales to existing customers. We typically enter into supply agreements with our major OEM customers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from three to five years and cover the manufacture of a range of products. Under these agreements, a customer typically purchases its requirements for specific products in particular geographic areas from us. However, these agreements generally do not obligate the customer to purchase minimum quantities of products, which can have the effect of reducing revenue and profitability. In addition, some customer contracts contain cost reduction objectives, which can also have the effect of reducing revenue from such customers.\nThe U.S., China, the E.U. and several other countries have imposed tariffs impacting certain imported products. Although our customers are generally liable to us for reimbursement of tariffs we pay on components imported for the manufacture of their products, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in recovering all of the tariffs that are owed to us. Unrecovered tariffs paid on behalf of our customers reduce our gross margins. Also, although we are required to pay tariffs upon importation of the components, we may not recover these amounts from customers until sometime later, which adversely impacts our operating cash flow in a given period. However the net impact of tariffs, after recovery from customers, has not been, and is not expected to be, material to us.\nOn October 3, 2022, subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, we completed a joint venture transaction in which we entered into a Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement (the SSPA) and a Joint Venture and Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. Pursuant to the SSPA and the Shareholders Agreement, the parties established Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (SIPL), our existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture to engage in manufacturing in India of telecommunications equipment, data center and internet equipment, medical equipment, clean technology equipment and other high-tech equipment. As a result of the transaction, RSBVL acquired shares of SIPL for approximately $215 million of cash such that immediately after the closing of the transaction, RSBVL holds 50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL and Sanmina holds the remaining 49.9% of the outstanding shares of SIPL. The amount received from RSBVL was based on preliminary calculations and is subject to adjustment based on final calculations. Given the terms of the agreements entered into by the parties concerning management of the joint venture, we expect to continue to consolidate SIPL in future periods.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). We review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the process used to develop estimates related to accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, environmental matters, litigation and other contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy and financial markets were disrupted and there is a significant amount of uncertainty about the length and severity of the consequences caused by the pandemic. We have considered information available to us as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and, other than the impairments described in Note 5, are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to our estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used by us in preparing our consolidated financial statements:\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated manufacturing solutions, components and Company-proprietary products. Other sources of revenue include logistic and repair services; design, development and engineering services; defense and aerospace programs; and sales of raw materials to customers whose requirements change after we have procured inventory to fulfill the customers forecasted demand.\nFor purposes of determining when to recognize revenue, and in what amount, we apply a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) we satisfy a performance obligation. Each of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments.\nWe recognize revenue for the majority of our contracts on an over time basis. This is due to the fact that 1) we do not have an alternative use for the end products we manufacture for our customers and have an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work-in-progress upon a customers cancellation of a contract for convenience or 2) our customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by our services. For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which we believe best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized on an over time basis include sales of vertically integrated manufacturing solutions (integrated manufacturing solutions and components); logistics and repair services; design, development and engineering services; and defense and aerospace programs.\nApplication of the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in our Defense and Aerospace division requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs. This division is an operating segment whose results are combined with eleven other operating segments and reported under CPS. In 2022, CPS revenue and gross profit were $1.5 billion and $194 million, respectively.\nWe update our estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs on a quarterly basis. These updated estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change.\nFor contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, we recognize revenue when we have transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include Company-proprietary products and sales of raw materials.\nInventories- We state inventories at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes raw materials, labor and manufacturing overhead. We regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and make provisions to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of\ninventory carrying amounts is affected by changes in customer demand for inventory that customers are not contractually obligated to purchase and inventory held for specific customers who are experiencing financial difficulties. Inventory write-downs are recorded based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or return inventories to our suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. Certain payments received from customers for inventories that have not been shipped to customers or otherwise disposed of are netted against inventory.\nWe generally procure inventory based on specific customer orders and forecasts. Customers generally have limited rights of modification (for example, rescheduling or cancellations) with respect to specific orders. Customer modifications of orders affecting inventory previously procured by us and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs may result in excess and obsolete inventory. Although we may be able to use some excess inventory for other products we manufacture, a portion of this excess inventory may not be returnable to vendors or recoverable from customers. Write-offs or write-downs of inventory could be caused by:\nchanges in customer demand for inventory, such as cancellation of orders, and our purchases of inventory beyond customer needs that result in excess quantities on hand that we are not able to return to the vendor, use to fulfill orders from other customers or charge back to the customer;\nfinancial difficulties experienced by specific customers for whom we hold inventory; and\ndeclines in the market value of inventory.\nLong-lived Assets-We review property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting that represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which a building is the primary asset, we estimate fair value primarily based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other assets, we estimate fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows, which requires significant judgment.\nIncome Taxes- We estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities. We believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter. Although we believe our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate, tax regulations are subject to interpretation and the tax controversy process is inherently lengthy and uncertain; therefore, our assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. To the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes, such changes in estimate will impact our income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. We only recognize or continue to recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold of being upheld. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nWe must also make judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. The carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. We evaluate positive and negative evidence each reporting period when assessing the need for a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if we believe realization of such assets is not more likely than not. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change due to changes in market conditions, new or modified tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions, and consequently our estimates, change in the future, the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased, resulting in a respective increase or decrease in income tax expense.\nOur effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the amount and geographic distribution of our worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations, rates and holidays in each geographic region, the utilization of net operating losses, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies.\nResults of Operations\nYears Ended October 1, 2022, October 2, 2021 and October 3, 2020.\nThe following table presents our key operating results.\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nNet sales $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\nGross profit $ 640,514 $ 551,805 $ 525,707\nGross margin 8.1 % 8.2 % 7.6 %\nOperating expenses $ 272,727 $ 270,505 $ 298,020\nOperating income $ 367,787 $ 281,300 $ 227,687\nOperating margin 4.7 % 4.2 % 3.3 %\nNet income $ 256,121 $ 268,998 $ 139,713\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased from $6.8 billion for 2021 to $7.9 billion for 2022, an increase of 16.8%. Net sales decreased from $7.0 billion for 2020 to $6.8 billion for 2021, a decrease of 2.9%. Sales by end market were as follows:\nYear Ended 2022 vs. 2021\n2021 vs. 2020\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020 Increase/(Decrease) Increase/(Decrease)\n(Dollars in thousands)\nIndustrial, Defense, Medical and Automotive $ 4,714,941 $ 3,890,041 $ 4,127,720 $ 824,900 21.2 % $ (237,679) (5.8) %\nCommunications Networks and Cloud Infrastructure 3,175,534 2,866,602 2,832,650 308,932 10.8 % 33,952 1.2 %\nTotal $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370 $ 1,133,832 16.8 % $ (203,727) (2.9) %\nComparison of 2022 to 2021 by End Market\nThe increase in sales was primarily due to three factors. First, there was stronger demand overall in each of our end markets, driven in part by the continued stabilization of lead times for supply constrained parts. Secondly, we were able to pass to our customers the vast majority of the increased cost of components caused by supply constraints. Lastly, we added several new programs that contributed to increased sales in 2022.\nComparison of 2021 to 2020 by End Market\nThe decrease in sales in our industrial, defense, medical and automotive end market was caused primarily by the continuing negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, which resulted in supply shortages, restrictions on the types of products we could manufacture and disruptions to our operations and those of our customers. In particular, there was a shortage of components in our industrial segment starting in the second half of 2021 that prevented us from shipping all of the product for which we had demand. The slight increase in sales in our communications networks and cloud infrastructure end market was primarily due to a more significant impact from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 than in 2021.\nGross Margin\nGross margin was 8.1%, 8.2% and 7.6% in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. IMS gross margin increased to 7.2% in 2022 from 7.1% in 2021. Despite an increase in revenue, IMS gross margin increased only slightly because there was little to no markup on the increased cost of components that we were able to pass on to our customers. Despite higher revenues, CPS gross margin decreased to 11.9% in 2022 from 12.7% in 2021, primarily due to a less favorable mix of revenue between the individual businesses in CPS.\nIMS gross margin increased to 7.1% in 2021 from 6.7% in 2020, primarily due to increased operational efficiencies and the benefit of cost reduction and containment efforts implemented in 2020, some of which were in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. CPS gross margin increased to 12.7% in 2021 from 11.5% in 2020, primarily due to increased volume, operational efficiencies, favorable product mix and the benefit of cost reduction and containment efforts described above.\nWe have experienced fluctuations in gross margin in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Fluctuations in our gross margin may be caused by a number of factors, including:\nthe ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain constraints on our operations, the operations of our suppliers and on our customers' businesses;\ncapacity utilization which, if lower, results in lower margins due to fixed costs being absorbed by lower volumes;\nchanges in the mix of high and low margin products demanded by our customers;\ncompetition in the EMS industry and pricing pressures from OEMs due to greater focus on cost reduction;\nthe amount of our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory, including those associated with distressed customers;\nlevels of operational efficiency and production yields; and\nour ability to transition the location of and ramp manufacturing and assembly operations when requested by a customer in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses were $244.6 million, $234.5 million and $240.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 3.1%, 3.5% and 3.5% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in absolute dollars in 2022 was primarily due to higher incentive compensation, partially offset by a decrease in our deferred compensation liability resulting from a decline in the market value of participant investment accounts in 2022. The decrease in absolute dollars in 2021 was primarily attributable to reduced headcount in 2021 resulting from continued actions under our Q1 FY20 Plan and reduced travel and certain other expenses in 2021 in continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRestructuring\nRestructuring costs were $11 million, $15 million, and $27 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table is a summary of restructuring costs:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020\n(In thousands)\nSeverance costs $ 319 $ 9,405 $ 17,919\nOther exit costs (recognized as incurred) 1,500 1,834 71\nTotal - Q1 FY20 Plan 1,819 11,239 17,990\nCosts incurred for other plans 9,606 3,818 8,793\nTotal - all plans\n$ 11,425 $ 15,057 $ 26,783\nQ1 FY20 Plan\nOn October 28, 2019, we adopted a Company-wide restructuring plan (Q1 FY20 Plan) under which we have incurred restructuring costs of approximately $31 million through October 1, 2022. These charges consist primarily of severance. Substantially all cash payments have occurred and actions under this plan are complete.\nOther plans\nOther plans include a number of plans for which costs are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate.\nAll Plans\nOur Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS) segment incurred costs of $1 million and $9 million for the year ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. Our CPS segment incurred costs of $10 million and $5 million for the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. In addition, we incurred costs of $1 million for the year ended October 2, 2021 for corporate headcount reductions that were not allocated to our IMS and CPS segments. We had accrued liabilities of $6 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021 for restructuring costs (exclusive of long-term environmental remediation liabilities).\nWe expect to incur restructuring costs, which could be material, in future periods primarily relating to vacant facilities and former sites for which we are or may be responsible for environmental remediation.\nGoodwill And Other Impairments\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $2 million in 2022 and 2020 for certain long-lived assets.\nDuring the second quarter of 2020, commodity prices in the oil and gas market experienced a sharp decline due to a combination of an oversaturated supply and a decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This commodity price decline negatively impacted the projected cash flows of our oil and gas reporting unit, which is part of our CPS operating segment. Therefore, we performed a goodwill impairment test for this particular reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge of $7 million. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. We had no such charge in 2022 and 2021.\nGain on Sale of Long-lived Assets\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we recognized a gain of $4.6 million primarily from the sale of a certain real property.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $22.5 million, $19.6 million and $28.9 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest expense increased $3 million in 2022 primarily due to higher daily average borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Interest expense decreased $9 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to lower daily average borrowings under our revolving credit facility in 2021.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther income (expense), net was $(26.3) million in 2022, $44.3 million in 2021 and a $(0.3) million in 2020.\nOther income (expense), net of $(26.3) million in 2022 consists primarily of a $7 million allowance that was provided for a note receivable from the 2021 sale of certain intellectual property assets based on our expectation that we will incur credit losses with the counterparty, a $6 million decline in the market value of participant investment accounts in our deferred compensation plan in 2022, $5 million in fees for sales of accounts receivable, a pension settlement charge of $2 million for the termination of our frozen U.S. defined benefit plan and a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nOther income (expense), net of $44.3 million in 2021 consists primarily of receipt of payments of $16 million in connection with settlements of certain anti-trust class action matters, a $15 million gain from the sale of certain intellectual property assets and an $8 million gain on liquidation of a foreign entity.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe recorded income tax expense of $64.5 million, $38.0 million and $61.0 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate was 20.1%, 12.4% and 30.4% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to a $16 million and $43 million tax benefit, respectively, resulting from the release of foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nNet cash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities $ 330,854 $ 338,342 $ 300,555\nInvesting activities (132,214) (91,325) (64,409)\nFinancing activities (314,299) (77,318) (210,280)\nEffect of exchange rate changes (4,510) (199) (81)\nIncrease (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (120,169) $ 169,500 $ 25,785\nKey Working Capital Management Measures\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\nDays sales outstanding (1) 48 64\nContract asset days (2) 20 19\nInventory turns (3) 4.9 6.3\nDays inventory on hand (4) 74 58\nAccounts payable days (5) 90 83\nCash cycle days (6) 52 58\n(1)Days sales outstanding (a measure of how quickly we collect our accounts receivable), or DSO, is calculated as the ratio of average accounts receivable, net, to average daily net sales for the quarter.\n(2)Contract asset days (a measure of how quickly we transfer contract assets to accounts receivable) are calculated as the ratio of average contract assets to average daily net sales for the quarter.\n(3)Inventory turns (annualized) (a measure of how quickly we sell inventory) are calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average inventory.\n(4)Days inventory on hand (a measure of how quickly we turn inventory into sales) is calculated as the ratio of average inventory for the quarter to average daily cost of sales for the quarter.\n(5)Accounts payable days (a measure of how quickly we pay our suppliers), or DPO, is calculated as the ratio of 365 days to accounts payable turns, in which accounts payable turns is calculated as the ratio of four times our cost of sales for the quarter to average accounts payable.\n(6)Cash cycle days (a measure of how quickly we convert investments in inventory to cash) is calculated as days inventory on hand plus days sales outstanding minus accounts payable days.\nCash and cash equivalents were $530 million at October 1, 2022 and $650 million at October 2, 2021. Our cash levels vary during any given period depending on the timing of collections from customers and payments to suppliers, borrowings under credit facilities, sales of accounts receivable under numerous programs we utilize, repurchases of capital stock and other factors. Our working capital was approximately $1.5 billion as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $331 million, $338 million and $301 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities consists of: (1) net income adjusted to exclude non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes and stock-based compensation expense and (2) changes in net operating assets, which are comprised of accounts receivable, contract assets, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities. Our working capital metrics tend to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter based on factors such as the linearity of our shipments to customers and purchases from suppliers, customer and supplier mix, and payment terms with customers and suppliers. These fluctuations can significantly affect our cash flows from operating activities.\nDuring 2022, we generated $446 million of cash from earnings, excluding non-cash items, and used $115 million of cash because of an increase in our net operating assets and liabilities, resulting primarily from increases in inventories and contract assets of $663 million and $155 million, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $554 million and $134 million, respectively. The increase in inventories is primarily due to shortages of certain components that prevented us from shipping all products for which we had both demand and the other components necessary to build such products. The increase in contract assets is primarily due to an increase in overall demand in 2022, which resulted in a higher level of services performed for which revenue has been recognized, but products had not been delivered to the customer. The increase in accounts payable is primarily attributable to an increase in inventory. The increase in accrued liabilities is primarily due to an increase in advance payments from customers and an increase in amounts collected under our accounts receivable sales program that had not been remitted as of the end of the quarter to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. DSO decreased from 64 days as of 2021 to 48 days as of 2022 due primarily to an increase in accounts receivable factoring.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $132 million, $91 million and $64 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, we used $139 million of cash for capital expenditures, purchased $2 million of long-term investments and received $8 million primarily from the sale of a certain property. In 2021, we used $73 million of cash for capital expenditures, paid $21 million in connection with a business combination, purchased $3 million of long-term investments and received $5 million from the sale of certain intellectual property assets.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $314 million, $77 million and $210 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In 2022, we repurchased $331 million of common stock (including $14 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $333 million of long-term debt using $350 million of proceed from the issuance of a term loan, incurred $3 million of costs in connection with the amendment of the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2018 (the Existing Credit Agreement) and received $2 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises. In 2021, we repurchased $64 million of common stock (including $10 million in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations), repaid an aggregate of $19 million of long-term debt, received $3 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock pursuant to stock option exercises and received $3 million of installment payments from the sale of certain intellectual property assets.\nRevolving Credit Facility. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) that amended and restated the Existing Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement provides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (Term Loan Due 2027), together with an accordion feature by which we can obtain, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions and commitment of the lenders, additional revolving commitments in an aggregate amount of up to $200 million.\nCosts incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement of $3 million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.\nThe Term Loan Due 2027 was fully drawn on the Closing Date and proceeds were used to repay the term loan outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. Upon repayment, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs for the Existing Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at our option, at either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate (SOFR) or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on our credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three-month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Credit Agreement, including the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on September 27, 2027. We are required to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to 1.25% of the principal in quarterly installments.\nOur and our subsidiary guarantors obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets (excluding real property) of Sanmina and its subsidiary guarantors, including cash, accounts receivable, inventory and the shares of certain of our subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs of October 1, 2022, no borrowings and $9 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $791 million was available to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of October 2, 2021.\nShort-term Borrowing Facilities. As of October 1, 2022, certain of our foreign subsidiaries had a total of $70 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were outstanding. These facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2024.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio, measured at the end of each fiscal quarter, and at all times a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, including covenants regarding the payment of taxes and other obligations, maintenance of insurance, reporting requirements and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Further, the Credit Agreement contains customary negative covenants limiting our ability and that of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur debt, grant liens, make investments, make acquisitions, make certain restricted payments and sell assets, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs of October 1, 2022, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nDuring 2022 and 2021 we repurchased 8.0 million shares and 1.5 million shares of our common stock for $317 million and $54 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of our business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce our liquidity. As a result, the timing of future repurchases depends upon our future capital needs, market conditions and other factors. As of October 1, 2022, an aggregate of $164 million remains available under these programs.\nWe are party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the RPA) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of trade receivables generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA. As of October 1, 2022, a maximum of $539 million of sold receivables can be outstanding at any point in time under this program, as amended, subject to limitations under our Existing Credit Agreement. Additionally, the amount available under the RPA is uncommitted and, as such, is available at the discretion of our third-party banking institutions. Under the Credit Agreement, the percentage of our total accounts receivable that can be sold and outstanding at any time is 50%. Trade receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by us.\nIn addition to the RPA, we have the option to participate in trade receivables sales programs that have been implemented by certain of our customers, as in effect from time to time. We do not service trade receivables sold under these other programs.\nThe sale of receivables under all of these programs is subject to the approval of the banks or customers involved and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell the maximum amount of receivables permitted by these programs when desired.\nUnder each of the programs noted above, we sell our entire interest in a trade receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. For the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, we sold $1.9 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and cash received is presented as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Discounts on sold receivables were not material for any period presented. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, $194 million and $7 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by us remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. Our sole risk with respect to receivables we service is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such receivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, we have not been required to repurchase any receivable we have sold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, we are required to remit amounts collected by us as servicer on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, $49 million and $18 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe enter into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate (Term SOFR) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of December 1, 2023, and effectively converts a portion of our variable interest rate obligations under our Amended Cash Flow Revolver to fixed interest rate obligations. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $350 million were outstanding as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of October 1, 2022 was approximately 4.1%. Given the recent rise in interest rates and the continued likelihood of additional rate increases, these interest rate swaps had a positive value of $6 million as of October 1, 2022, of which the majority is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining amount is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are or may become party to legal proceedings, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, warranty and employee matters and examinations by government agencies. As of October 1, 2022, we had accrued liabilities of $38 million related to such matters. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of these matters or the amount or timing of cash flows that may be required to defend ourselves or to settle such matters or that these reserves will be sufficient to fully satisfy our contingent liabilities.\nAs of October 1, 2022, we had a liability of $65 million for uncertain tax positions. Our estimate of liabilities for uncertain tax positions is based on a number of subjective assessments, including the likelihood of a tax obligation being assessed, the amount of taxes (including interest and penalties) that would ultimately be payable, and our ability to settle any such obligations on favorable terms. Therefore, the amount of future cash flows associated with uncertain tax positions may be significantly higher or lower than our recorded liability and we are unable to reliably estimate when cash settlement may occur.\nOur liquidity is largely dependent on changes in our working capital, including sales of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and the extension of trade credit by our suppliers, investments in manufacturing inventory, facilities and equipment, repayments of obligations under outstanding indebtedness and repurchases of common stock. In 2022, we generated $331 million of cash from operations. Our primary sources of liquidity as of October 1, 2022 consisted of (1) cash and cash equivalents of $530 million; (2) our Credit Agreement, under which $791 million, net of outstanding borrowings and letters of credit, was available; (3) our foreign short-term borrowing facilities of $70 million, all of which was available; (4) proceeds from the sale of accounts receivable under our receivables sales programs and (5) cash generated from operations. Subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, we may increase the revolver commitments under the Credit Agreement by an additional $200 million.\nWe believe our existing cash resources and other sources of liquidity, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, should demand for our services decrease significantly over the next 12 months, should we be unable to recover on inventory obligations owed to us by our customers or should we experience significant increases in delinquent or uncollectible accounts receivable for any reason, our cash provided by operations could decrease significantly and we could be required to seek additional sources of liquidity to continue our operations at their current level.\nWe distribute our cash among a number of financial institutions that we believe to be of high quality. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of such institutions will not become insolvent in the future, in which case all or a portion of our uninsured funds on deposit with such institutions could be lost.\nAs of October 1, 2022, approximately 50% of our cash balance was held in the United States. Should we choose or need to remit cash to the United States from our foreign locations, we may incur tax obligations which would reduce the amount of cash ultimately available to the United States. We believe that cash held in the United States, together with liquidity available under our Amended Cash Flow Revolver and cash from foreign subsidiaries that could be remitted to the United States without tax consequences, will be sufficient to meet our United States liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months.\nContractual Obligations\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. These obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs. Our estimated future obligations consist of leases, the Term Loan, pension plan funding obligations and unrecognized tax benefits as of October 1, 2022.\nA summary of our operating lease obligations as of October 1, 2022 can be found in Note 8, Leases, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nA summary of our long-term debt obligations as of October 1, 2022 can be found in Note 7, Debt, to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report.\nWe have defined benefit pension plans with an underfunded amount of $34 million as of October 1, 2022. We will be required to provide additional funding to these plans in the future if our returns on plan assets are not sufficient to meet our funding obligations. Additionally, as of October 1, 2022, we were unable to reliably estimate when cash settlements or closure of audits with taxing authorities may occur with respect to our long-term liabilities arising from unrecognized tax benefits of $65 million. The statutes of limitations for these matters range up to 10 years, and unsettled liabilities are released upon expiration of the statutes.\nWe also have outstanding firm purchase orders with certain suppliers for the purchase of inventory, which are not included in the table above. These purchase orders are generally short-term in nature. Orders for standard, or catalog, items can typically be canceled with little or no financial penalty. Our policy regarding non-standard or customized items dictates that such items are only ordered specifically for customers who have contractually assumed liability for the inventory, although exceptions are made to this policy in certain situations. Accordingly, our liability from purchase obligations under these purchase orders is not expected to be significant. Lastly, pursuant to arrangements under which vendors consign inventory to us, we may be required to purchase such inventory after a certain period of time. To date, we have not been required to purchase a significant amount of inventory pursuant to these time limitations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of October 1, 2022, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC, that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in our financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our Term Loan of $350 million under our Credit Agreement for which the interest rate we pay is determined at the time of borrowing based on a floating index. As of October 1, 2022, we had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $350 million that effectively convert $350 million of our outstanding floating rate debt to fixed rate debt. An immediate 10 percent change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe transact business in foreign currencies. Our foreign exchange policy requires that we take certain steps to limit our foreign exchange exposures resulting from certain assets and liabilities and forecasted cash flows. However, our policy does not require us to hedge all foreign exchange exposures. Furthermore, our foreign currency hedges are based on forecasted transactions and estimated balances, the amount of which may differ from that actually incurred. As a result, we can experience foreign exchange gains and losses in our results of operations.\nOur primary foreign currency cash flows are in certain Asian and European countries, Israel, Brazil and Mexico. We enter into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts generally have maturities of up to two months. Accordingly, these forward contracts are not designated as part of a hedging relationship for accounting purposes. All outstanding foreign currency forward contracts are marked-to-market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income. As of October 1, 2022, we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts to exchange various foreign currencies for U.S. dollars in an aggregate notional amount of $532 million.\nWe also utilize foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (cash flow) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts may be up to twelve months in duration and are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the contracts is recorded in stockholders' equity as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings when the hedged item affects earnings. We had forward contracts related to cash flow hedges in various foreign currencies in an aggregate notional amount of $123 million as of October 1, 2022.\nThe net impact of an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates would not be material to our consolidated financial statements, provided we accurately forecast and estimate our foreign currency exposure. If such forecasts are materially inaccurate, we could incur significant gains or losses. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe information required by this item is included below and incorporated by reference from the financial statement schedule included in Part IV-Item 15(a)(2).\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Sanmina Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Sanmina Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2022, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the Defense and Aerospace division\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues for the CPS segment were $1.5 billion for the year ended October 1, 2022, of which the defense and aerospace division represents a portion of the segment. The Company recognizes revenue for defense and aerospace government contracts on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion), which management believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Recognition of revenue on government contracts requires the use of significant judgment with respect to estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining the estimated costs for such contracts, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence related to managements determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the defense and aerospace division. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for determining the estimation of costs for a sample of defense and aerospace government contracts, (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of managements determination of estimated materials, labor, and subcontractor costs. Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs used involved assessing managements ability to reasonably estimate costs for government contracts by assessing the nature and status of government contracts, performing retrospective reviews of government contract estimates and changes in estimates over time, and obtaining evidence to support estimated costs.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSan Jose, California\nNovember 10, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2016.\nSANMINA CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n(In thousands, except par value)\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 529,857 $ 650,026\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances of approximately $8 million and $7 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively\n1,138,894 1,192,434\nContract assets 503,674 348,741\nInventories 1,691,081 1,036,511\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 62,044 53,952\nTotal current assets 3,925,550 3,281,664\nProperty, plant and equipment, net 575,170 532,985\nDeferred income tax assets, net 198,588 235,117\nOther 160,192 156,953\nTotal assets $ 4,859,500 $ 4,206,719\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 2,029,534 $ 1,464,693\nAccrued liabilities 275,735 161,896\nAccrued payroll and related benefits 130,892 117,648\nShort-term debt, including current portion of long-term debt 17,500 18,750\nTotal current liabilities 2,453,661 1,762,987\nLong-term liabilities:\nLong-term debt 329,237 311,572\nOther 215,333 253,532\nTotal long-term liabilities 544,570 565,104\nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 10)\nStockholders' equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, authorized 5,000 shares, none issued and outstanding\n- -\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, authorized 166,667 shares; 110,160 and 108,734 shares issued and 57,394 and 64,307 shares outstanding as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively\n574 643\nTreasury stock, 52,766 and 44,427 shares as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively, at cost\n(1,378,159) (1,047,202)\nAdditional paid-in capital 6,380,774 6,338,863\nAccumulated other comprehensive income 56,325 40,690\nAccumulated deficit (3,198,245) (3,454,366)\nTotal stockholders' equity 1,861,269 1,878,628\nTotal liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 4,859,500 $ 4,206,719\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSANMINA CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet sales $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\nCost of sales 7,249,961 6,204,838 6,434,663\nGross profit 640,514 551,805 525,707\nOperating expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative 244,569 234,537 240,931\nResearch and development 21,343 20,911 22,564\nRestructuring and other 11,425 15,057 27,916\nGoodwill impairment -

Organization of Sanmina\nSanmina Corporation (Sanmina, or the Company) was incorporated in Delaware in 1989. The Company is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. The Company provides these comprehensive solutions primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that serve the industrial, medical, defense and aerospace, automotive, communications networks and cloud infrastructure industries.\nThe Company's operations are managed as two businesses:\n1)Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS). IMS is a single operating segment consisting of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct-order-fulfillment.\n2)Components, Products and Services (CPS). Components include printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies, fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions (VES) division; optical, radio frequency (RF) and microelectronic (microE) design and manufacturing services from Advanced Microsystems Technologies; defense and aerospace products from SCI Technology; and cloud-based manufacturing execution software from the Company's 42Q division. Services include design, engineering and logistics and repair.\nThe Company's only reportable segment is IMS, which represented approximately 80% of total revenue in 2022. CPS consists of multiple operating segments which do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for being presented as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled Components, Products and Services.\nBasis of Presentation\nFiscal Year. The Company operates on a 52 or 53 week year ending on the Saturday nearest September 30. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were each 52 weeks and fiscal 2020 was a 53-week year, with the extra week occurring during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. All references to years relate to fiscal years unless otherwise noted.\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nNote 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nManagement Estimates and Uncertainties. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy and financial markets were disrupted and there is a significant amount of uncertainty about the length and severity of the consequences caused by the pandemic. The Company has considered information available to it as of the date of issuance of these financial statements and is not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require an update to its estimates or judgments, or a revision to the carrying value of its assets or liabilities. Significant estimates made in preparing the consolidated financial statements relate to allowances for accounts receivable; provisions for excess and obsolete inventories, environmental matters, and legal exposures; determining liabilities for uncertain tax positions; determining the realizability of deferred tax assets; and determining fair values of tangible and intangible assets for purposes of impairment tests. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information becomes available. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nFinancial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk. Financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swap agreements, accounts payable and debt obligations. The fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying amount as of October 1, 2022 and\nOctober 2, 2021 due to the nature or short maturity of these instruments, or because, in some cases, the instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit and investments in highly liquid debt instruments with maturities of three months or less.\nAccounts Receivable and Other Related Allowances. The Company had allowances of approximately $8 million and $7 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively, for uncollectible accounts, product returns and other net sales adjustments. To establish the allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company estimates credit risk associated with accounts receivable by considering the creditworthiness of its customers, past experience, specific facts and circumstances, and the overall economic climate in industries that it serves. To establish the allowance for product returns and other adjustments, the Company primarily utilizes historical data.\nAccounts Receivable Sales. The Company is a party to a Receivables Purchase Agreement (the RPA) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of trade receivables generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA. Trade receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by the Company.\nIn addition to the RPA, the Company has the option to participate in trade receivables sales programs that have been implemented by certain of the Company's customers, as in effect from time to time. The Company does not service trade receivables sold under these other programs. Under each of the programs noted above, the Company sells its entire interest in a trade receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. Accounts receivable balances sold are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and the related proceeds are reported as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nInventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and manufacturing overhead.\nProvisions are made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. The ultimate realization of inventory carrying amounts is primarily affected by changes in customer demand. Inventory provisions are established based on forecasted demand, past experience with specific customers, the age and nature of the inventory, the ability to redistribute inventory to other programs or back to suppliers, and whether customers are contractually obligated and have the ability to pay for the related inventory. Certain payments received from customers for inventory held by the Company are recorded as a reduction of inventory.\nLong-lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or, in the case of property and equipment acquired through business combinations, at fair value as of the acquisition date. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over 20 to 40 years for buildings and 3 to 15 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and fixtures. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the asset.\nThe Company reviews property, plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. An asset group is the unit of accounting which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. An asset or asset group is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flows the asset or asset group is expected to generate. If an asset or asset group is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. For asset groups for which the primary asset is a building, the Company estimates fair value based on data provided by commercial real estate brokers. For other asset groups, the Company estimates fair value based on projected discounted future net cash flows.\nForeign Currency Translation. For foreign subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated to U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. The effects of these translation adjustments are reported in stockholders' equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). For all entities, remeasurement adjustments for non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities are included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Remeasurement gains and losses arising from long-term intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than an entity's functional currency are recorded in AOCI if repayment of the loan is not anticipated in the foreseeable future.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company conducts business on a global basis in numerous currencies and certain of the Company's outstanding debt has a variable interest rate. Therefore, the Company is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company uses derivatives, such as foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps, to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.\nThe Company accounts for derivative instruments and hedging activities in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, which requires each derivative instrument to be recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value as either an asset or a liability. If a derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the Company excludes time value from its assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the amount of time value in earnings over the life of the derivative. Gains or losses on the derivative not caused by changes in time value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), a component of equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. If a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the item being hedged are recognized in earnings in the current period.\nDerivative instruments are entered into for periods of time consistent with the related underlying exposures and are not entered into for speculative purposes. At the inception of a hedge, the Company documents all relationships between derivative instruments and related hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for the hedging transaction.\nThe Company's foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps potentially expose the Company to credit risk to the extent the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreement. The Company minimizes such risk by seeking high quality counterparties.\nLeases. The Company's leases consist primarily of operating leases for buildings and land and have initial lease terms of up to 44 years. Certain of these leases contain an option to extend the lease term for additional periods or to terminate the lease after an initial non-cancelable term. Renewal options are considered in the measurement of the Company's initial lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset only if it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. Leases with lease terms of twelve months or less are not recorded on the Company's balance sheet.\nThe Companys lease liability and ROU assets represent the present value of future lease payments which are a combination of lease components and non-lease components such as maintenance and utilities. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease. Certain of the Companys lease payments are variable because such payments adjust periodically based on changes in consumer price and other indexes. Variable payments are expensed as incurred and not included in the measurement of lease liabilities and ROU assets. Since the Company's leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date for purposes of determining the present value of lease payments. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease and the effect of collateralization, if any.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company derives revenue principally from sales of integrated manufacturing solutions, components and Company-proprietary products. Other sources of revenue include logistics and repair services; design, development and engineering services; defense and aerospace programs; and sales of raw materials to customers whose requirements change after the Company has procured inventory to fulfill the customers forecasted demand.\nFor purposes of determining when to recognize revenue, and in what amount, the Company applies a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Each of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for the majority of its contracts on an over time basis. This is due to the fact that 1) the Company does not have an alternative use for the end products it manufactures for its customers and has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work-in-progress upon a customers cancellation of a contract for convenience or 2) the Companys customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Companys services. For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized on an over time basis include sales of vertically integrated manufacturing solutions (integrated manufacturing solutions and components); global services (logistics and repair); design, development and engineering services; and defense and aerospace programs.\nApplication of the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the Companys Defense and Aerospace division requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs. This division is an operating segment whose results are combined with eleven other operating segments and reported under Components, Products and Services (CPS) for segment reporting purposes. In 2022, CPS revenue and gross profit were $1.5 billion and $194 million, respectively.\nThe Company updates its estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs on a quarterly basis. These updated estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change.\nFor contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, the Company recognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer. Revenue streams for which revenue is recognized at a point-in-time include Company-proprietary products and sales of raw materials.\nRefer to Note 4 for further discussion.\nIncome taxes. The Company estimates its income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates, including estimating exposures and making judgments regarding the realizability of deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The carrying value of the Company's net deferred tax assets is based on the Company's belief that it is more likely than not that the Company will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets. A valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which do not meet the more likely than not criteria discussed above.\nThe Company's tax rate is dependent upon the geographic distribution of its worldwide income or losses, the tax regulations and tax holidays in each geographic region, the availability of tax credits and carryforwards, including net operating losses, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies.\nThe Company makes an assessment of whether each income tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, if any. For each income tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold, the Company then assesses the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon effective settlement with the tax authority. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncement Adopted\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The amendments are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted this ASU during the fourth quarter of 2022. The impact of adoption was not material.\nNote 3.

Refer to Note 17 for discussion.\nThe Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs arising from the amendment and restatement of the Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2018. Refer to Note 7 for discussion.\nIn 2021, the Company sold intellectual property for $15 million, of which $8 million has been received in cash. The sale of intellectual property was included in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company concluded it expected to incur credit losses with the counterparty for the remaining $7 million due under the arrangement. Accordingly, the Company recorded a charge of $7 million in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income to establish an allowance for the expected credit loss.\nA foreign entity of the Company was substantially liquidated in 2021 and the Company reclassified $8 million of cumulative translation adjustments associated with this entity from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income in 2021.\nThe Company received $16 million of cash in 2021 in connection with settlements of certain anti-trust class action matters.\nNote 4. Revenue Recognition\nThe Company is a leading global provider of integrated manufacturing solutions, components, products and repair, logistics and after-market services. For purposes of determining when to recognize revenue, and in what amount, the Company applies a 5-step model: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. Each of these steps may involve the use of significant judgments, as discussed below.\nStep 1 - Identify the contract with a customer\nA contract is defined as an agreement between two parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. The Company generally enters into a master supply agreement (MSA) with its customers that provides the framework under which business will be conducted, and pursuant to which a customer will issue purchase orders or other binding documents to\nspecify the quantity, price and delivery requirements for products or services the customer wishes to purchase. The Company generally considers its contract with a customer to be a firm commitment, consisting of the combination of an MSA and a purchase order or any other similar binding document.\nStep 2 - Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nA performance obligation is a promised good or service that is material in the context of the contract and is both capable of being distinct (customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with other readily available resources) and distinct within the context of the contract (separately identifiable from other promises). The Company reviews its contracts to identify promised goods or services and then evaluates such items to determine which of those items are performance obligations. The majority of the Companys contracts have a single performance obligation since the promise to transfer an individual good or service is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The Companys performance obligations generally have an expected duration of one year or less.\nStep 3 - Determine the transaction price\nThe Companys contracts with its customers may include certain forms of variable consideration such as early payment discounts, volume discounts and shared cost savings. The Company includes an estimate of variable consideration when determining the transaction price and the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized. This estimate is limited to an amount which will not result in a significant reversal of revenue in a future period. Factors considered in the Companys estimate of variable consideration are the potential amount subject to these contract provisions, historical experience and other relevant facts and circumstances.\nStep 4 - Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nA contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. In the event that more than one performance obligation is identified in a contract, the Company is required to allocate a portion of the transaction price to each performance obligation. This allocation would generally be based on the relative standalone price of each performance obligation, which most often would represent the price at which the Company would sell similar goods or services separately.\nStep 5 - Recognize revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied\nThe Company is required to assess whether control of a product or services promised under a contract is transferred to the customer at a point-in-time or over time as the product is being manufactured or the services are being provided. If the criteria in ASC 606 for recognizing revenue on an over time basis are not met, revenue must be recognized at the point-in-time determined by the Company at which its customer obtains control of a product or service.\nThe Company has determined that revenue for the majority of its contracts is required to be recognized on an over time basis. This determination is based on the fact that 1) the Company does not have an alternative use for the end products it manufactures for its customers and has an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit, for work-in-progress upon a customers cancellation of a contract for convenience or 2) the Companys customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the Companys services. For these contracts, revenue is recognized on an over time basis using the cost-to-cost method (ratio of costs incurred to date to total estimated costs at completion) which the Company believes best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. At least 95% of the Company's revenue is recognized on an over time basis, which is as products are manufactured or services are performed. Because of this, and the fact that there is no work-in-process or finished goods inventory associated with contracts for which revenue is recognized on an over-time basis, 99% or more of the Companys inventory at the end of a given period is in the form of raw materials. For contracts for which revenue is required to be recognized at a point-in-time, the Company recognizes revenue when it has transferred control of the related goods, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery of the goods to the customer.\nApplication of the cost-to-cost method for government contracts in the Companys Defense and Aerospace division requires the use of significant judgments with respect to estimated materials, labor and subcontractor costs. This division is an operating segment whose results are combined with eleven other operating segments and reported under Components, Products and Services (CPS) for segment reporting purposes. In 2022, CPS revenue and gross profit were $1.5 billion and $194 million, respectively.\nThe Company updates its estimates of materials, labor and subcontractor costs on a quarterly basis. These updated estimates are reviewed each quarter by a group of employees that includes representatives from numerous functions such as engineering, materials, contracts, manufacturing, program management, finance and senior management. If a change in estimate is deemed necessary, the impact of the change is recognized in the period of change.\nContract Assets\nA contract asset is recognized when the Company has recognized revenue, but has not issued an invoice to its customer for payment. Contract assets are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets and transferred to accounts receivable when rights to payment become unconditional. Because of the Companys short manufacturing cycle times, the transfer from contract assets to accounts receivable generally occurs within the next fiscal quarter.\nOther\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue.\nShipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control of a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of sales.\nThe Company applies the following practical expedients or policy elections under ASC 606:\nThe promised amount of consideration under a contract is not adjusted for the effects of a significant financing component because, at inception of a contract, the Company expects the period between when a good or service is transferred to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will generally be one year or less.\nThe Company has elected to not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less, which is substantially all of the Companys remaining performance obligations.\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract are not capitalized if the period over which such costs would be amortized to expense is less than one year.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nIn the following table, revenue is disaggregated by segment, market sector and geography.\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nSegments:\nIMS $ 6,372,442 $ 5,454,269 $ 5,699,751\nCPS 1,518,033 1,302,374 1,260,619\nTotal $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\nEnd Markets:\nCommunications Networks and Cloud Infrastructure $ 3,175,534 $ 2,866,602 $ 2,832,650\nIndustrial, Defense, Medical and Automotive 4,714,941 3,890,041 4,127,720\nTotal $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\nGeography:\nAmericas (1) $ 3,719,496 $ 3,182,849 $ 3,450,527\nAPAC 3,007,904 2,517,963 2,514,005\nEMEA 1,163,075 1,055,831 995,838\nTotal $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\n(1) Mexico represents approximately 60% of the Americas revenue and the U.S. represents approximately 35%.\nNote 5. Financial Instruments\nFair Value Measurements\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of cash equivalents (generally 10% or less of cash and cash equivalents), accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term debt approximate carrying value due to the short-term duration of these instruments. Additionally, the fair value of variable rate long-term debt approximates carrying value as of October 1, 2022.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe Company's primary financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are deferred compensation plan assets and defined benefit plan assets, which are both measured using Level 1 inputs. Deferred compensation plan assets were $37 million and $46 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. Defined benefit plan assets were $17 million and $40 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. Other financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, which are both measured using Level 2 inputs. Foreign exchange contracts were not material as of October 1, 2022 or October 2, 2021. Interest rate swaps had a positive value of $6 million and a negative value of $19 million, as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively.\nOffsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company has entered into master netting arrangements with each of its derivative counterparties that allows net settlement of derivative assets and liabilities under certain conditions, such as multiple transactions with the same currency maturing on the same date. The Company presents its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on a gross basis on the consolidated balance sheets. The amount that the Company had the right to offset under these netting arrangements was not material as of October 1, 2022 or October 2, 2021.\nNon-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nOther non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets, are measured at fair value as of the date such assets are acquired or in the period an impairment is recorded. During 2020, commodity prices in the oil and gas market experienced a sharp decline due to a combination of an oversaturated supply and a decrease in demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. This commodity price decline resulted in a negative impact to the projected cash flows of the Companys oil and gas reporting unit that is part of the Company's Components, Products and Services (CPS) operating segment and, therefore, the Company performed a goodwill impairment test for this particular reporting unit. The Company concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit was below its carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge of $7 million. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. The Company also recorded an impairment charge of $2 million in 2022 and 2020 for certain long-lived assets.\nDerivative Instruments\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nThe Company is exposed to certain risks related to its ongoing business operations. The primary risk managed by using derivative instruments is foreign currency exchange risk.\nForward contracts on various foreign currencies are used to manage foreign currency risk associated with forecasted foreign currency transactions and certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. The Company's primary foreign currency cash flows are in certain Asian and European countries, Brazil, Israel and Mexico.\nThe Company had the following outstanding foreign currency forward contracts that were entered into to hedge foreign currency exposures:\nAs of\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021\nDerivatives Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nNotional amount (in thousands) $ 123,172 $ 110,098\nNumber of contracts 50 48\nDerivatives Not Designated as Accounting Hedges:\nNotional amount (in thousands) $ 531,558 $ 353,108\nNumber of contracts 43 46\nThe Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain operational (cash flow) exposures resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Such exposures generally result from (1) forecasted non-functional currency sales and (2) forecasted non-functional currency materials, labor, overhead and other expenses. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are generally one to two months in duration but, by policy, may be up to twelve months in duration.\nFor derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the Company excludes time value from its assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognizes the amount of time value in earnings over the life of the derivative instrument. Gains or losses on the derivative not caused by changes in time value are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), a component of equity, and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The amount of gain or loss recognized in Other Comprehensive Income on derivative instruments and the amount of gain or loss reclassified from AOCI into income were not material for any period presented herein.\nThe Company enters into short-term foreign currency forward contracts to hedge currency exposures associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. These contracts have maturities of up to two months and are not designated as accounting hedges. Accordingly, these contracts are marked-to-market at the end of each period with unrealized gains and losses recorded in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income. The amount of gains or losses associated with these forward contracts was not material for any period presented herein. From an economic perspective, the objective of the Company's hedging program is for gains and losses on forward contracts to substantially offset gains and losses on the underlying hedged items. In addition to the contracts disclosed in the table above, the Company has numerous contracts that have been closed from an economic and financial accounting perspective and will settle early in the first month of the following quarter. Since these offsetting contracts do not expose the Company to risk of fluctuations in exchange rates, these contracts have been excluded from the above table.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe Company enters into forward interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in Secured Overnight Financing Rate benchmark interest rate (SOFR) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These interest rate swaps have a maturity date of December 1, 2023, and effectively convert the Company's variable interest rate obligations to fixed interest rate obligations. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $350 million were outstanding as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of October 1, 2022 was approximately 4.1%. Given the recent rise in interest rates and the likelihood of additional rate increases, these interest rate swaps had a positive value of $6 million as of October 1, 2022, of which the majority is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining amount is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 6. Financial Instruments and Concentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable, foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements. The carrying value of assets such as cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable is expected to approximate fair value due to the short duration of the assets. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents with recognized financial institutions that management believes to be of high credit quality. One of the Company's most significant credit risks is the ultimate realization of accounts receivable. This risk is mitigated by ongoing credit evaluations of, and frequent contact with, the Company's customers, especially its most\nsignificant customers, thus enabling it to monitor changes in business operations and respond accordingly. The Company generally does not require collateral for sales on credit. The Company considers these concentrations of credit risks when estimating its allowance for doubtful accounts. Foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps are maintained with high quality counterparties to reduce the Company's credit risk and are recorded on the Company's balance sheets at fair value.\nNokia and Motorola each represented more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 2022. Nokia represented more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 2021 and 2020. Motorola represented 10% or more of the Company's gross accounts receivable as of October 1, 2022 and Nokia represented 10% or more of the Company's gross accounts receivable as of October 2, 2021.\nNote 7. Debt\nLong-term debt consisted of the following:\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n(In thousands)\nTerm loan due 2023, net of issuance costs $ - $ 330,322\nTerm loan due 2027, net of issuance costs 346,737 -\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt 17,500 18,750\nLong-term debt $ 329,237 $ 311,572\nRevolving Credit Facility.\nOn September 27, 2022 (the Closing Date), the Company entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) that amended and restated the Companys existing Fourth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated as of November 30, 2018 (the Existing Credit Agreement) by, among other things: (i) increasing the revolving commitments amount, (ii) providing for a term loan facility and (iii) replacing LIBOR with SOFR for purposes of determining the interest rate payable for borrowings under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for an $800 million revolving credit facility and a $350 million secured term loan (Term Loan Due 2027). Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders, the Company may increase the revolving commitment up to an additional $200 million. Costs incurred in connection with the amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement of $3 million are classified as long-term debt and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the Term Loan Due 2027 using the effective interest method.\nThe Term Loan Due 2027 was fully drawn on the Closing Date and the proceeds were used to repay the term loan outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement. Upon repayment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1 million consisting of a write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs of the Existing Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option, at either the SOFR or a base rate, in each case plus a spread determined based on the Company's credit rating. Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears with respect to base rate loans and at the end of an interest period (and at three month intervals if the interest period exceeds three months) in the case of SOFR loans. The outstanding principal amount of all loans under the Credit Agreement, including, the Term Loan Due 2027, together with accrued and unpaid interest, is due on September 27, 2027. The Company is required to repay a portion of the principal amount of the Term Loan Due 2027 equal to 1.25% of the principal in quarterly installments.\nMaturities of the Term Loan Due 2027 as of October 1, 2022 by fiscal year are as follows:\n(In Thousands)\n2023 $ 17,500\n2024 13,125\n2025 17,500\n2026 21,875\n2027 280,000\n$ 350,000\nCertain of the Companys domestic subsidiaries are guarantors in respect of the Credit Agreement. The Company and the subsidiary guarantors obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of their respective assets (excluding real property), including cash, accounts receivable and the shares of certain Company subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.\nAs of October 1, 2022, no borrowings and $9 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the Credit Agreement, under which $791 million was available to borrow. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of October 2, 2021.\nForeign Short-term Borrowing Facilities. As of October 1, 2022, certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company had a total of $70 million of short-term borrowing facilities available, under which no borrowings were outstanding. These facilities expire at various dates through the second quarter of 2024.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company's Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, namely a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio, in both cases measured on the basis of a trailing 12 month look-back period. In addition, the Company's debt agreements contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making investments and other restricted payments, selling assets and paying dividends, subject to certain exceptions. The Company was in compliance with these covenants as of October 1, 2022.\nNote 8. Leases\nROU assets and lease liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows:\nAs of\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2,\n(In thousands)\nOther assets $ 79,495 $ 68,012\nAccrued liabilities $ 16,695 $ 17,219\nOther long-term liabilities 48,566 38,587\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 65,261 $ 55,806\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years) 15.74 14.46\nWeighted average discount rate 2.4 % 2.72 %\nLease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to operating leases are as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\nOperating lease expense (1) $ 23,978 $ 21,455 $ 20,670\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n(In thousands)\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities $ 19,249 $ 19,531\n(1) Includes immaterial amounts of short term leases, variable lease costs and sublease income.\nFuture lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases as of October 1, 2022, by fiscal year, are as follows:\nOperating Leases\n(In thousands)\n2023 $ 18,109\n2024 15,350\n2025 12,450\n2026 8,907\n2027 5,724\nThereafter 10,412\nTotal lease payments\n70,952\nLess: imputed interest 5,691\nTotal\n$ 65,261\nNote 9. Accounts Receivable Sale Program\nThe Company is a party to a Receivable Purchase Agreement (the RPA) with certain third-party banking institutions for the sale of trade receivables generated from sales to certain customers, subject to acceptance by, and a funding commitment from, the banks that are party to the RPA. Trade receivables sold pursuant to the RPA are serviced by the Company.\nIn addition to the RPA, the Company has the option to participate in trade receivables sales programs that have been implemented by certain of the Company's customers, as in effect from time to time. The Company does not service trade receivables sold under these other programs.\nUnder each of the programs noted above, the Company sells its entire interest in a trade receivable for 100% of face value, less a discount. For the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company sold approximately $1.9 billion and approximately $0.5 billion, respectively, of accounts receivable under these programs. Upon sale, these receivables are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and cash received is presented as cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Discounts on sold receivables were not material for any period presented. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, $194 million and $7 million, respectively, of accounts receivable sold under the RPA and subject to servicing by the Company remained outstanding and had not yet been collected. The Company's sole risk with respect to receivables it services is with respect to commercial disputes regarding such receivables. Commercial disputes include billing errors, returns and similar matters. To date, the Company has not been required to repurchase any receivable it has sold due to a commercial dispute. Additionally, the Company is required to remit amounts collected as servicer under the RPA on a weekly basis to the financial institutions that purchased the receivables. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, $49 million and $18 million, respectively, had been collected but not yet remitted. This amount is classified in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 10. Contingencies\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to litigation, claims and other contingencies, including environmental, regulatory and employee matters and examinations and investigations by governmental agencies, which arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a contingent liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, or other applicable accounting standards. As of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, the Company had reserves of $38 million and $37 million, respectively for environmental matters, warranty, litigation and other contingencies (excluding reserves for uncertain tax positions), which the Company believes are adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's reserves will be sufficient to settle these contingencies. Such reserves are included in accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLegal Proceedings\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and administrative orders concerning environmental protection, including those addressing the discharge of pollutants into the environment, the management and disposal of hazardous substances, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the materials used in products, and the recycling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. As of October 1, 2022, the Company had been named in a lawsuit and several administrative orders alleging certain of its current and former sites contributed to groundwater contamination. One such order demands that the Company and other alleged defendants remediate groundwater contamination at four landfills located in Northern California to which the Company may have sent wastewater in the past. The Company is participating in a working group of other alleged defendants to better understand its potential exposure in this action and has reserved its estimated exposure for this matter as of October 1, 2022. However, there can be no assurance that the Company's reserve will ultimately be sufficient.\nIn June 2008, the Company was named by the Orange County Water District in a suit alleging that a predecessor companys actions at a plant the Company sold in 1998 contributed to polluted groundwater managed by the plaintiff. The complaint seeks recovery of compensatory and other damages, as well as declaratory relief, for the payment of costs necessary to investigate, monitor, remediate, abate and contain contamination of groundwater. In April 2013, all claims against the Company were dismissed. The plaintiff appealed this dismissal and the Court of Appeal reversed the judgment in August 2017, remanding the case back to the Superior Court of California for trial. The first phase of a multi-phase trial against the Company and several other defendants commenced in April 2021 and the submission of evidence concluded in May 2022. On June 28, 2022, the Court issued a tentative ruling finding Sanmina and the other defendants liable for certain past investigation costs incurred by the plaintiff. A final statement of decision in this phase of the trial is expected on or about the middle of calendar year 2023. Based upon the Courts tentative ruling, the Company believes a loss in this matter is probable and has recorded an estimated loss. Subsequent trial phases to assess the Companys and certain other defendants liability for the plaintiffs future remediation and other costs, and the allocation of damages among the liable defendants, are anticipated to occur in 2024 and beyond. It is probable that the Company will record additional losses in connection with this matter, and it is reasonably possible that the amount of such additional losses will be material. However, at the current time, the Company is unable to estimate the amount of such additional losses or a range of losses. The Company intends to continue defending the case vigorously and to seek appellate review of any adverse liability rulings or judgment at the appropriate time.\nOther Matters\nIn October 2018, a contractor who had been retained by the Company through a third party temporary staffing agency filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Santa Clara County Superior Court on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated Company contractors and employees in California, alleging violations of California Labor Code provisions governing overtime, meal and rest periods, wages, wage statements and reimbursement of business expenses. The complaint sought certification of a class of all non-exempt employees. Although the Company continued to deny any wrongdoing, on November 19, 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve all claims, including claims under Californias Private Attorneys General Act of 2004 (the Settlement), which also resulted in the dismissal of a suit alleging substantially similar claims filed in the Santa Clara County Superior Court in June 2021. The final amount of the judicially approved Settlement was approximately $4 million, and was paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\nIn December 2019, the Company sued a former customer, Dialight plc (Dialight), in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to collect approximately $10 million in unpaid accounts receivable and net obsolete inventory obligations. Later the same day, Dialight commenced its own action in the same court. Dialights complaint, which asserts claims for fraudulent inducement, breach of contract, and gross negligence/willful misconduct, alleges that the Company fraudulently misrepresented its capabilities to induce Dialight to enter into a Manufacturing Services Agreement (the Dialight MSA), and then breached its obligations contained in the Dialight MSA relating to quality, on-time delivery and supply chain management. Dialight seeks compensatory and punitive damages that it contends exceed $200 million, but which the Company believes are vastly overstated and are subject to a contractual limitation of liability that limits any Dialight recovery to less than $2 million. The Company continues to vigorously prosecute its claims against Dialight. Further, the Company strongly disagrees with Dialights allegations and is defending against them vigorously. No trial date has been set in this matter.\nFor each of the pending matters noted above, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss at this time.\nNote 11. Restructuring\nRestructuring costs were $11 million, $15 million, and $27 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table is a summary of restructuring costs:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020\n(In thousands)\nSeverance costs $ 319 $ 9,405 $ 17,919\nOther exit costs (recognized as incurred) 1,500 1,834 71\nTotal - Q1 FY20 Plan 1,819 11,239 17,990\nCosts incurred for other plans 9,606 3,818 8,793\nTotal - all plans\n$ 11,425 $ 15,057 $ 26,783\nQ1 FY20 Plan\nOn October 28, 2019, the Company adopted a Company-wide restructuring plan (Q1 FY20 Plan) under which the Company has incurred restructuring costs of approximately $31 million as of October 1, 2022. These charges consist primarily of severance. Substantially all cash payments have occurred and actions under this plan are complete.\nOther plans\nOther plans include a number of plans for which costs are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate.\nAll Plans\nThe Companys Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS) segment incurred costs of $1 million and $9 million for the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. The Companys CPS segment incurred costs of $10 million and $5 million for the years ended October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. In addition, the Company incurred costs of $1 million for the year ended October 2, 2021 for Corporate headcount reductions that were not allocated to the Company's IMS and CPS segments. The Company had accrued liabilities of $6 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, for restructuring costs (exclusive of long-term environmental remediation liabilities).\nThe Company expects to incur restructuring costs, which could be material, in future periods primarily relating to vacant facilities and former sites for which the Company is or may be responsible for environmental remediation.\nNote 12. Income Taxes\nDomestic and foreign components of income before income taxes were as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nDomestic $ 163,979 $ 200,300 $ 96,993\nForeign 156,649 106,705 103,765\nTotal $ 320,628 $ 307,005 $ 200,758\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nFederal:\nCurrent $ 1,070 $ 705 $ (917)\nDeferred 29,222 34,157 9,460\nState:\nCurrent 2,060 4,241 1,705\nDeferred 3,081 (302) 2,579\nForeign:\nCurrent 29,640 (906) 46,376\nDeferred (566) 112 1,842\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 64,507 $ 38,007 $ 61,045\nThe Company's provision for income taxes for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $65 million (20% of income before taxes), $38 million (12% of income before taxes) and $61 million (30% of income before taxes), respectively.\nThe effective tax rates for 2022 and 2021 were lower than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to a $16 million and $43 million tax benefit, respectively, resulting from the release of a foreign tax reserves due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations. The effective tax rate for 2020 is higher than the expected U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to foreign operations that are taxed at rates higher than the U.S. statutory rate.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAs of\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021\n(In thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nU.S. net operating loss carryforwards $ 81,917 $ 127,243\nForeign net operating loss carryforwards 109,416 112,516\nIntangibles 25,099 24,219\nAccruals not currently deductible 44,963 43,932\nProperty, plant and equipment 27,514 25,494\nTax credit carryforwards 18,465 17,250\nReserves not currently deductible 14,939 11,534\nStock compensation expense 6,365 7,677\nFederal benefit of foreign operations 21,312 18,336\nDerivatives and other impacts of OCI 838 7,637\nLease deferred tax asset 15,018 11,563\nOther 1,915 -\nValuation allowance (118,210) (115,258)\nTotal deferred tax assets 249,551 292,143\nDeferred tax liabilities on undistributed earnings (14,775) (14,775)\nDeferred tax liabilities on branch operations (24,182) (30,000)\nRevenue recognition (1,572) (1,702)\nLease deferred tax liability (14,808) (11,349)\nOther - (2,495)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 194,214 $ 231,822\nRecorded as:\nDeferred tax assets $ 198,588 $ 235,117\nDeferred tax liabilities (4,374) (3,295)\nNet deferred tax assets $ 194,214 $ 231,822\nA valuation allowance is established or maintained when, based on currently available information and other factors, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company regularly assesses its valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis. The Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial results. Significant judgment is required in assessing the Company's ability to generate revenue, gross profit, operating income and jurisdictional taxable income in future periods. The Company's valuation allowance as of October 1, 2022 relates primarily to foreign net operating losses, with the exception of $14 million related to U.S. state net operating losses.\nThe Company provides deferred tax liabilities for the tax consequences associated with the undistributed earnings that are expected to be repatriated to subsidiaries' parent unless the subsidiaries' earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested. As of October 1, 2022, income taxes and foreign withholding taxes have not been provided for approximately $439 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.\nAs of October 1, 2022, the Company has cumulative net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and foreign tax purposes of $292 million, $357 million and $465 million, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin expiring in fiscal years 2028 and 2023, respectively, and expire at various dates through September 29, 2035. Certain foreign net operating losses start expiring in 2023. However, the majority of foreign net operating losses carryforward indefinitely. As of October 1, 2022, the Company has federal tax credits of $21 million that expire between 2031 and 2042. There are certain restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. The utilization of certain net operating losses may be restricted due to changes in ownership and business operations.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the statutory federal tax rate to the Company's effective tax rate:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\nFederal tax at statutory tax rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %\nEffect of foreign operations 2.63 7.33 13.02\nPermanent items 0.07 (1.86) (0.59)\nFederal credits (0.65) (0.50) (1.31)\nOther 0.28 (0.17) (0.06)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 1.74 1.01 1.96\nRelease of foreign tax reserves (4.96) (14.43) (3.61)\nEffective tax rate 20.11 % 12.38 % 30.41 %\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of total liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding accrued penalties and interest, is as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nBalance, beginning of year $ 67,781 $ 74,612 $ 66,677\nIncrease (decrease) related to prior year tax positions (4,456) 6,063 1,327\nIncrease related to current year tax positions 7,154 7,349 9,907\nSettlements (7,596) - -\nDecrease related to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations (9,331) (20,243) (3,299)\nBalance, end of year $ 53,552 $ 67,781 $ 74,612\nThe Company had reserves of $11 million and $17 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits. During 2022, the Company recognized an income tax benefit for interest and penalties of $3 million due to lapse of time and expiration of statutes of limitations compared to an income tax benefit of $23 million in 2021. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Should the Company be able to ultimately recognize all of these uncertain tax positions, it would result in a benefit to net income of $44 million in 2022.\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The Company is currently being audited by the Internal Revenue Service for tax years 2008 through 2010. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts accrued, this would result in an increase or decrease in net operating loss carryforwards which could materially impact tax expense. Additionally, the Company is being audited by various state tax agencies and certain foreign countries. To the extent the final tax liabilities are different from the amounts accrued, the increases or decreases would be recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of income. Although the Company believes that the resolution of these audits will not have a material adverse impact on the Companys results of operations, the outcome is subject to uncertainty.\nIn general, the Company is no longer subject to United States federal or state income tax examinations for years before 2003, and to foreign examinations for years prior to 2006 in its major foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that the\nbalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by approximately $9 million related to payments, the resolution of audits and expiration of statutes of limitations. In addition, there could be a corresponding decrease in accrued interest and penalties of approximately $4 million.\nNote 13. Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3, 2020\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet income $ 256,121 $ 268,998 $ 139,713\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 61,310 65,318 69,041\nEffect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock units 1,807 1,766 1,752\nDenominator for diluted earnings per share 63,117 67,084 70,793\nNet income per share:\nBasic $ 4.18 $ 4.12 $ 2.02\nDiluted $ 4.06 $ 4.01 $ 1.97\nWeighted-average dilutive securities that were excluded from the above calculation because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect under ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, due to application of the treasury stock method were not material for any period presented.\nNote 14. Stockholders' Equity\nThe Company's 2009 Stock Plan (2009 Plan) expired as to future grants on January 26, 2019. Although the 2009 Plan expired, it will continue to govern all awards granted under it prior to its expiration date. On March 11, 2019, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (2019 Plan) and the reservation of 4 million shares of common stock for issuance thereunder, plus any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the 2009 Plan that expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and shares issued pursuant to awards granted that are forfeited by the Company.\nAs of October 1, 2022, an aggregate of 7 million shares were authorized for future issuance under the Company's stock plans, of which 4 million of such shares were issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and delivery of shares upon vesting of restricted stock units and 3 million shares of common stock were available for future grant. Awards other than stock options reduce common stock available for grant by 1.36 shares for every share of common stock subject to such an award. Awards under the 2019 Plan and 2009 Plan that expire or are cancelled without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance under the 2019 Plan. The 2019 Plan will expire as to future grants in December 2028.\nStock Repurchase Program\nDuring 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company repurchased 8.0 million shares, 1.5 million shares and 6.4 million shares of its common stock for $317 million, $54 million and $166 million (including commissions), respectively, under stock repurchase programs authorized by the Board of Directors. These programs have no expiration dates and the timing of repurchases will depend upon capital needs to support the growth of the Companys business, market conditions and other factors. Although stock repurchases are intended to increase stockholder value, purchases of shares reduce the Companys liquidity. As of October 1, 2022, an aggregate of $164 million remains available under these programs.\nIn addition to the repurchases discussed above, the Company repurchased 369,000, 286,000 and 398,000 shares of its common stock during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock units. The Company paid $14 million, $10 million and $13 million, respectively, to applicable tax authorities in connection with these repurchases.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nAccumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax as applicable, consisted of the following:\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n(In thousands)\nForeign currency translation adjustments $ 63,929 $ 76,120\nUnrealized holding gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments 4,112 (14,305)\nUnrecognized net actuarial loss and unrecognized transition cost for benefit plans (11,716) (21,125)\nTotal $ 56,325 $ 40,690\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, a foreign entity of the Company was substantially liquidated and the Company reclassified $8 million of cumulative translation adjustments associated with this entity from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. During the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company reclassified $2 million of unrecognized pension losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of income. There were no other significant reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to the consolidated statements of income for any period presented.\nUnrealized holding gain (loss) on derivative financial instruments includes losses from interest rate swap agreements with independent counterparties to partially hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate (SOFR) associated with anticipated variable rate borrowings. These swaps are accounted for as cash flow hedges under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $350 million were outstanding as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021. The aggregate effective interest rate of these swaps as of October 1, 2022 was approximately 4.1% and was approximately 4.3% as of October 2, 2021. These interest rate swaps had a negative value of $19 million as of October 2, 2021, of which $9 million is included in accrued liabilities and the remaining amount is included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Given the recent rise in interest rates and the likelihood of additional rate increases, these interest rate swaps had a positive value of $6 million as of October 1, 2022, of which the majority is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining amount is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nNote 15. Business Segment, Geographic and Customer Information\nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments, products and services, geographic areas of operations and major customers. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decision making group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nThe Company's operations are managed as two businesses:\n1)Integrated Manufacturing Solutions (IMS). IMS is a reportable segment consisting of printed circuit board assembly and test, high-level assembly and test and direct order fulfillment.\n2)Components, Products and Services (CPS). Components include printed circuit boards, backplanes and backplane assemblies, cable assemblies fabricated metal parts, precision machined parts, and plastic injected molded parts. Products include memory solutions from our Viking Technology division; high-performance storage platforms for hyperscale and enterprise solutions from our Viking Enterprise Solutions (VES) division; optical, radio frequency (RF) and microelectronics (microE) design and manufacturing services from Advanced Microsystems Technologies; defense and aerospace products from SCI Technology; and cloud-based manufacturing execution software from the Company's 42Q division. Services include design, engineering and logistics and repair.\nThe Company determined that it has only one reportable segment - IMS, which generated approximately 80% of the Company's total revenue in 2022. CPS consists of multiple operating segments which do not meet the quantitative threshold for being presented individually as reportable segments. Therefore, financial information for these operating segments is combined and presented in a single category entitled Components, Products and Services.\nThe accounting policies for each segment are the same as those disclosed by the Company for its consolidated financial statements. Intersegment sales consist primarily of sales of components from CPS to IMS.\nThe Company's chief operating decision making group is the Chief Executive Officer who allocates resources and assesses performance of operating segments based on a measure of revenue and gross profit that excludes items not directly related to the Company's ongoing business operations. These items are typically either non-recurring or non-cash in nature.\nSegment information is as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020\n(In thousands)\nGross sales:\nIMS $ 6,407,724 $ 5,485,612 $ 5,733,180\nCPS 1,631,918 1,397,742 1,365,712\nIntersegment revenue (149,167) (126,711) (138,522)\nNet Sales $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\nGross Profit:\nIMS $ 462,606 $ 391,339 $ 381,638\nCPS\n193,817 177,248 156,844\nTotal 656,423 568,587 538,482\nUnallocated items (1) (15,909) (16,782) (12,775)\nTotal $ 640,514 $ 551,805 $ 525,707\nDepreciation and amortization:\nIMS $ 73,914 $ 77,076 $ 81,169\nCPS 30,061 27,770 26,718\nTotal 103,975 104,846 107,887\nUnallocated corporate items (2) 4,808 4,810 6,331\nTotal $ 108,783 $ 109,656 $ 114,218\nCapital expenditures (receipt basis):\nIMS $ 94,636 $ 44,672 $ 23,933\nCPS 55,993 33,839 23,915\nTotal 150,629 78,511 47,848\nUnallocated corporate items (2) 5,650 3,343 3,227\nTotal $ 156,279 $ 81,854 $ 51,075\n(1) For purposes of evaluating segment performance, management excludes certain items from its measures of gross profit. These items consist of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, charges or credits resulting from distressed customers and litigation settlements.\n(2) Primarily related to selling, general and administration functions.\nSegment assets, consisting of accounts receivable, inventories and fixed assets, are substantially proportional to segment sales.\nNet sales by geographic segment, determined based on the country in which a product is manufactured were as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nNet sales:\nAmericas (1) $ 3,719,496 $ 3,182,849 $ 3,450,527\nAPAC 3,007,904 2,517,963 2,514,005\nEMEA 1,163,075 1,055,831 995,838\nTotal $ 7,890,475 $ 6,756,643 $ 6,960,370\n(1) Mexico represents approximately 60% of the Americas revenue and the U.S. represents approximately 35%.\nPercentage of net sales represented by ten largest customers 48.7 % 52.7 % 55.5 %\nNumber of customers representing 10% or more of net sales 2 1 1\nAs of\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n(In thousands)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net:\nAmericas $ 367,172 $ 322,545\nAPAC 151,254 143,111\nEMEA 56,744 67,329\nTotal $ 575,170 $ 532,985\nNote 16. Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense was recognized as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 1,\n2022 October 2,\n2021 October 3,\n(In thousands)\nCost of sales $ 14,065 $ 14,472 $ 10,099\nSelling, general and administrative 25,037 20,118 15,897\nResearch and development 506 386 239\nTotal $ 39,608 $ 34,976 $ 26,235\nThe Company grants restricted stock units and restricted stock units with performance conditions (PSUs) to executive officers, directors and certain other employees. These units vest over periods ranging from one year to four years and/or upon achievement of specified performance criteria, with associated compensation expense recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nThe Company grants shares for which vesting is contingent on cumulative non-GAAP earnings per share measured over three fiscal years. If a minimum threshold is not achieved during the measurement period, the shares will be cancelled. If a minimum threshold is achieved or exceeded, the number of shares of common stock that will be issued will range from 80% to 120% of the number of PSUs granted, depending on the extent of performance. Additionally, the number of shares that vest may be adjusted up or down by up to 15% based on the Company's total shareholder return relative to that of its peer group over this same period.\nActivity with respect to the Company's restricted stock units and PSUs was as follows:\nNumber of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\n($) Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term\n(Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\n($)\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nOutstanding as of September 28, 2019\n3,153 27.82 1.30 102,720\nGranted 1,340 32.51\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,925) 28.62\nOutstanding as of October 3, 2020\n2,568 29.67 1.23 71,571\nGranted 1,529 34.26\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,143) 29.27\nOutstanding as of October 2, 2021\n2,954 32.21 1.23 113,591\nGranted 1,644 40.54\nVested/Forfeited/Cancelled (1,318) 30.42\nOutstanding as of October 1, 2022\n3,280 37.11 1.35 155,049\nExpected to vest as of October 1, 2022\n2,909 36.93 1.28 137,524\nThe fair value of restricted stock units that vested during the year was $44 million for 2022, $32 million for 2021 and $43 million for 2020. As of October 1, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense of $68 million is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.3 years.\nNote 17. Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has various defined contribution retirement plans that cover the majority of its domestic employees. These retirement plans permit participants to elect to have contributions made to the retirement plans in the form of salary deferrals. Under these retirement plans, the Company may match a portion of employee contributions. Amounts contributed by the Company were not material for any period presented herein.\nThe Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for eligible employees that allows participants to defer payment of all or part of their compensation. Deferrals under this plan were immaterial. Assets associated with these plans were $37 million and $46 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. Liabilities associated with these plans were $37 million and $46 million as of October 1, 2022 and October 2, 2021, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other non-current assets and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDefined benefit plans covering certain employees in the United States and Canada were frozen in 2001. Employees who had not yet vested will continue to be credited with service until vesting occurs, but no additional benefits will accrue. During the third quarter of 2022, the Board of Directors approved the termination of the Company's frozen U.S. defined benefit plan (the Plan) effective July 3, 2022. In connection with this termination, the Company purchased a group annuity contract for $6 million during the fourth quarter of 2022 that provides for the administration of future payments to eligible plan participants. In addition, the Company recorded a pension settlement charge of $2 million during the fourth quarter of 2022, which includes the reclassification of unrecognized pension losses from accumulated other comprehensive income to other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company also provides defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries. The assumptions used for calculating the pension benefit obligations for non-U.S. plans depend on the local economic environment and regulations. The measurement date for the Company's defined benefit plans is October 1, 2022.\nThe funded status and plan assets for the defined benefit plans and amount reported on the consolidated balance sheets were as follows:\nAs of\nOctober 1, 2022 October 2, 2021 October 3, 2020\nNon-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S. U.S. Non-U.S.\n(In thousands)\nPlan Assets $ 17,290 $ 16,435 $ 23,575 $ 15,430 $ 23,575\nProjected Benefit Obligation 50,871 22,943 63,217 25,704 64,453\nUnderfunded Status $ 33,581 $ 6,508 $ 39,642 $ 10,274 $ 40,878\nCurrent Liabilities $ 3,038 $ - $ 2,674 $ - $ 2,054\nNon-current liabilities 30,543 6,508 36,968 10,274 38,824\nTotal liabilities $ 33,581 $ 6,508 $ 39,642 $ 10,274 $ 40,878\nThe Companys investment strategy is designed to help ensure that sufficient pension assets are available to pay benefits as they become due. Plan assets are invested in mutual funds that are valued using the NAV that is quoted in active markets (Level 1 input). These plans are managed consistent with regulations or market practices of the country in which the assets are invested. As of October 1, 2022 there were no significant concentrations of credit risk related to pension plan assets. All other amounts and assumptions were not material for any period presented herein.\nNote 18. Strategic Transactions\nIndia Joint Venture\nOn October 3, 2022, subsequent to the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed a joint venture transaction in which the Company entered into a Share Subscription and Purchase Agreement (the SSPA) and a Joint Venture and Shareholders Agreement (the Shareholders Agreement) with Reliance Strategic Business Ventures Limited (RSBVL), a wholly owned subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited. Pursuant to the SSPA and the Shareholder Agreement, the parties established Sanmina SCI India Private Limited (SIPL), the Companys existing Indian manufacturing entity, as a joint venture to engage in manufacturing in India of telecommunications equipment, data center and internet equipment, medical equipment, clean technology equipment and other high-tech equipment. As a result of the transaction, RSBVL acquired shares of SIPL for approximately $215 million of cash such that immediately after the closing of the transaction, RSBVL holds 50.1% of the outstanding shares of SIPL and Sanmina holds the remaining 49.9% of the outstanding shares of SIPL. The amount received from RSBVL was based on preliminary calculations and is subject to adjustment based on final calculations. Given the terms of the agreements entered into by the parties concerning management of the joint venture, the Company expects to continue to consolidate SIPL in future periods.\nAcquisition\nOn April 6, 2021, the Company purchased all of the outstanding stock of a European subsidiary of a multinational company in the industrial end market. This acquisition increased the Company's IMS capabilities in Europe. The Company also entered into a master supply agreement with the seller in connection with this acquisition. Total consideration paid in this acquisition was $38 million of cash, of which $29 million was paid upon closing and $9 million is due in April 2023. The acquiree had $8 million of cash as of the acquisition date, resulting in a net cash outlay upon closing of $21 million. The pro-forma effect of the acquisition, as if it had occurred at the beginning of the year, was not material to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition is reported in the Company's IMS reportable segment.\nThe Company's allocation of the purchase price was based on management's estimate of the acquisition-date fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe following represents the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed.\n(In thousands)\nCurrent assets, including cash acquired of $8.1 million\n$ 18,696\nNoncurrent assets, including identifiable intangible assets of $4.4 million and goodwill of $8.5 million\n30,711\nCurrent liabilities (10,671)\nNoncurrent liabilities (152)\nTotal net assets acquired $ 38,584\nGoodwill reflects the expectation that the acquisition enables the Company to increase its IMS capabilities in Europe. Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over four years. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\n(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that their objectives are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of disclosure controls and procedures must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that all disclosure control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. Nonetheless, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of October 1, 2022, (1) our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and (2) our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b) Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Our management has concluded that, as of October 1, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the COSO criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2022 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under Item 8.\n(c) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended October 1, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
