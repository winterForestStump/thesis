    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWe are a consumer packaged goods holding company with businesses operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice and food ingredient categories. We also participate in the private brand food category, including through our ownership interest in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (8th Avenue). In addition, we participate in the global convenient nutrition category, including through our minority ownership of BellRing Brands, Inc., a publicly-traded holding company offering ready-to-drink (RTD) shake and powder protein products (refer to Recent Strategic Transactions - BellRing Brands, Inc. below for a discussion of our recent transactions involving BellRing Brands, Inc.). Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Form 10-K to Post, the Company, us, our or we mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPost is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off from its former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the ticker symbol POST.\nWe operate in four reportable segments:\nPost Consumer Brands: Includes branded and private label ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals from the businesses of Post Foods, LLC, MOM Brands Company, LLC, which Post acquired in May 2015, Weetabix North America, which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of Weetabix Limited in July 2017 referred to below, and the RTE cereal operations of TreeHouse Foods, Inc., which Post acquired in June 2021, as well as nut butters under the Peter Pan brand, which Post acquired in January 2021;\nWeetabix: Includes the businesses of Weetabix Limited, which Post acquired in July 2017 and which produces and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal, hot cereals and other cereal-based food products, breakfast drinks and muesli primarily outside of North America, and Lacka Foods Limited, which Post acquired in April 2022 and which distributes and markets protein-based RTD shakes under the UFIT brand primarily in the United Kingdom (the U.K.);\nFoodservice: Includes primarily egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels from the businesses of MFI Holding Corporation (Michael Foods), which Post acquired in June 2014, National Pasteurized Eggs, Inc. (NPE), which Post acquired in October 2016, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (Bob Evans), which Post acquired in January 2018, Henningsen Foods, Inc., which Post acquired in July 2020, and Almark Foods (Almark), which Post acquired in February 2021; and\nRefrigerated Retail: Provides refrigerated retail products, inclusive of side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products, from the businesses of Bob Evans, Michael Foods, including the business of Crystal Farms Dairy Company (Crystal Farms), which Post acquired as a part of its acquisition of Michael Foods in June 2014, NPE and Almark, as well as the Egg Beaters brand, which Post acquired in May 2021.\nFor additional information regarding our reportable segments, refer to Note 21 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRecent Strategic Transactions\nBellRing Brands, Inc.\nOn October 21, 2019, the initial public offering of a minority interest in our historical active nutrition business was completed (the BellRing IPO). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO (the BellRing formation transactions), BellRing Brands, Inc. (Old BellRing) became a holding company owning 28.8% of the non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units) of BellRing Brands, LLC and a publicly-traded company with its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock), trading on the NYSE under the ticker symbol BRBR. Immediately after the BellRing IPO, Post owned 71.2% of the BellRing LLC units and one share of Old BellRings Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock). For additional information regarding the BellRing IPO, refer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to a transaction agreement and plan of merger, Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing LLC units and cash to BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) in exchange for certain limited liability company interests in BellRing and the right to receive\n$840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes and such transactions are collectively referred to as the BellRing Contribution). On March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post consummated the distribution of 80.1% of its ownership interest in BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock), to Posts shareholders (the BellRing Distribution, and such transaction, the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Merger (as defined below) and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange (which refers to Posts delivery of the BellRing Notes to certain of its lenders in full satisfaction of certain of its debt obligations on March 10, 2022, as described in more detail in Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report) are collectively referred to as the BellRing Spin-off). Upon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing, merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus $2.97 in cash. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, BellRing became the holding company for the legacy Old BellRing business. Immediately following the BellRing Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2% of the BellRing Common Stock and Post shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the BellRing business as prior to the BellRing Spin-off. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to Post shareholders for United States (U.S.) federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock. For additional information regarding the BellRing Spin-off, refer to Note 4 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nOn August 11, 2022, pursuant to an exchange agreement, Post transferred 14.8 million shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain lenders to repay and retire $342.3 million in aggregate principal amount of debt (such exchange, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange). Immediately after the completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, Post held 4.6 million shares, or 3.4%, of BellRing Common Stock. For additional information regarding the Debt-for Equity Exchange, refer to Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nRefer to Risk Factors in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperating and Industry Risks\nIncreased input costs, including costs for freight, raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFreight costs and availability are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations and any naturally occurring or climate change-induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events.\nThe primary ingredients used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, pork, pasta, potatoes, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit, nuts and water. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments also use corn and soybean meal as the primary grains fed to layer hens. Our primary packaging materials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging and plastic lined cartonboard. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, electricity, carbon dioxide, sanitizing supplies and personal protective equipment. The supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including those listed above for freight as well as geopolitical events, national or international disputes, terrorism, animal feed costs, agricultural yield, governmental programs, regulations or trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (such as the 2015 and 2022 AI outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak) and milk price supports established by the USDA. Higher prices for natural gas, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. In addition, the prices of inputs may increase as we pursue more sustainable, specially sourced or certified raw materials or alternative energy sources, including mandatory or voluntary transitions to low carbon renewables. We also have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional operating expenses as a result of cleaning and safety protocols implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWhile, historically, the prices of freight and certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our businesses have fluctuated, we experienced higher than expected manufacturing and supply chain costs during fiscal 2022, largely due to cost pressures resulting from economic conditions, including inflation and rising interest rates, labor shortages and other downstream impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. We expect to continue to experience heightened costs in fiscal 2023. In addition, from time to time, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience shortages of certain of our raw materials, which have resulted, and we expect to continue to result, in us paying increased costs for such inputs and have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to produce our products.\nThe prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our input costs at the time they occur or at all. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of inflationary and other cost pressures through pricing and efficiency gains, if these measures are ineffective or are not implemented in a timely manner, changes in input costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we may not be able to raise our prices sufficiently in response to cost increases as a result of factors such as economic conditions, including inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or economic slowdowns, or competitive pressures. In addition, while we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by using hedges to lock in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, third party manufacturers and distributors, our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from inflation, the need for repairs or enhancements at facilities (including delays in repairing, obtaining and installing equipment), execution issues, labor shortages, insufficient product or raw material availability, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, geopolitical events, national or international disputes, terrorism, war or armed hostilities (including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), border closures, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including\nprolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, water stress, agricultural diseases, fires or evacuations related thereto, explosions, cyber incidents, strikes or other labor unrest or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. Competitors are, from time to time, affected differently by any of these events depending on a number of factors, including the location of their operations, suppliers and third party manufacturers and distributors. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when an input is sourced from, or a product is manufactured at, a single location, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruptions in our supply chain, including as a result of temporary workforce disruptions, labor shortages, delays in repairing, obtaining and installing equipment and other factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its downstream impacts and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and there is a continued risk of disruptions occurring in the future. Demand for certain of our products exceeded our production capacity at various points during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to experience pressures on our supply chain during fiscal 2023. In some instances, we have had, and continue to have, certain of our products on allocation. We continue to actively monitor the performance of our supply chain and operations; however, if we are unable to accurately predict future impacts on our supply chain due to various uncertainties, including the downstream impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the labor market and the economy, the emergence of new variants of the COVID-19 virus and the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic or its downstream impacts, changes in consumer behaviors and the impact of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.\nWe are currently dependent upon third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many of our products. Our businesses could suffer as a result of a third partys inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications.\nOur businesses rely on independent third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many products. Our businesses could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if any of these third parties is unable to fulfill its obligations to us, if any of these third parties fails to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the supply of materials for or manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, from time to time, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, operational difficulties with these third parties, which may include increases in costs, reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, delays in the addition of incremental capacity, failures to meet shipment or production deadlines, including as a result of public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and related governmental restrictions or mandates and any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, errors in complying with specifications and insufficient quality control. The inability of a third party supplier or manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our businesses.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, temporary workforce disruptions occurring for any reason could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur employees are critical to our success. We depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key employees including our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our businesses. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for skilled and talented employees. If we lose key employees, including one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our businesses, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. In addition, activities relating to recruiting, hiring, integrating and training our workforce may require significant time and expense. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our businesses experienced, and may in the future experience, heightened employee turnover and labor shortages, resulting in our inability to meet consumer demand for certain of our products and lost institutional knowledge, which negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur businesses are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs. If we experience workforce disruptions or periods where our employees are unable to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of employee absenteeism or widespread employee illness or based upon shelter in place or other restrictions put in place by governmental authorities (such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic), our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nUncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including pricing actions taken in response to such conditions, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers discretionary spending habits. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, such as periods of inflation, rising interest rates, recessions or economic slowdowns, consumers may purchase less of our products, purchase more value or private label products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In certain of our businesses, during fiscal 2022, we experienced shifts to more value or private label products in response to inflation and other economic conditions. In addition, our customers actively manage their inventory levels and from time to time seek to reduce their inventories in response to such economic conditions. These circumstances adversely impact our profitability. Also, as a result of such economic conditions, we may not be able to raise our prices sufficiently, including in response to increased costs (such as those resulting from inflation), to protect profit margins. Further, uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its downstream impacts and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, have negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the financial stability of our customers or suppliers, which could lead to increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in categories with strong competition.\nThe consumer food and beverage categories in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition in these categories is based on, among other things, brand appeal, recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Some of our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources and may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In most product categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to increased costs (such as those resulting from inflation). Also, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks and digital platforms to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment and use social media and digital platforms effectively, it could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPublic health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and the economic uncertainty and other downstream impacts resulting from such crises have adversely impacted, are adversely impacting and could continue to adversely impact our financial and operational performance.\nPublic health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures that have been and may in the future be taken by governments, businesses, including us, and individuals in response to such crises have had, are having and could continue to have certain impacts on our financial and operational performance, including the following:\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, shifts in consumption of our foodservice and certain on-the-go products due to reduced consumer traffic or changes in consumer preferences in response to public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the operations of third parties in our supply chain has included, and as a result of the downstream impacts of the pandemic, in certain cases we expect will in the future include, employee absenteeism and labor shortages, failure of third parties on which we rely to meet their obligations to us or disruptions in their ability to do so, increases in the costs, or reductions in the availability and timely delivery, of ingredients, packaging and other materials used to manufacture our products, operational delays, increases in the cost of freight, lack of adequate manufacturing capacity and delays in repairs at our facilities. We may experience similar impacts in the future as a result of other public health crises.\nWe have incurred, and expect in the future to incur, increased operating expenses as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the changes in safety protocols that have resulted from the pandemic, which at various points have included, and in certain cases we expect to continue to include, facility reconfiguration costs, purchases of equipment and supplies in high demand, costs to engage third party resources and costs for facility sanitizings. We may in the future incur such additional operating expenses as a result of other public health crises.\nUnexpected variability and volatility in consumer demand that may constrain our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain and result in our inability to meet customer demand (such as occurred for certain of our products at certain points during the COVID-19 pandemic).\nConsumer perceptions of our response to a public health crisis, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and any perceived quality or health concerns (whether or not valid) regarding our products, could affect our brand value. In addition,\nactions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, in response to a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.\nSignificant policy changes in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import or export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions or unemployment or other benefits) could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeteriorating economic conditions resulting from public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, such as economic slowdowns or recessions or significant disruptions or volatility in financial markets, could limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations or impact the cost or availability of additional capital.\nBusiness disruptions and uncertainties related to public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on planned timelines.\nThese and other impacts resulting from public health crises have, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, materially affected, and may in the future materially affect, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the impacts of such public health crises, have, in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, heightened or manifested, or may in the future heighten or manifest, other risks set forth herein, any of which could have a material effect on us. Public health crises evolve rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of as of the date hereof.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, consumer at-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, shifts to more value or private label products, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns (including climate change) regarding packaging and manufacturing processes and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company, products and operations. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences and behaviors and our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers have increasingly been shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications, and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in many of our markets. If we or our customers are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, and appropriately act on such insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the housing of layer hens, as well as certain other farm animals. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply, as well as goals for other farm animal initiatives, by specified future dates. Also, several states have enacted, or are proposing, provisions providing for specific requirements for the housing of certain farm animals. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing and comply with other farm animal initiatives. Also, our businesses are, and we expect will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the environmental and social impact of products. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging or requiring certified ingredients for specific products. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment, including within our manufacturing processes, which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our businesses. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including adverse publicity about us, our business practices, products, packaging, ingredients or sponsorship or endorsement relationships (whether or not valid), our suppliers or third party manufacturers business practices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, consumer perceptions that\nwe have acted in an irresponsible manner or any failure or perceived failure to achieve sufficient environmental, social and governance performance. In addition, negative perceptions of the food and beverage industry as a whole, or segments of the food and beverage industry in which we operate, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, our shareholders and other stakeholders to such factors and could adversely affect our brand image. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative social media posts or comments about us, our business practices, brands, products, ingredients, packaging, sponsorship or endorsement relationships, suppliers or third party manufacturers or the food and beverage industry generally (whether or not valid) in the media, especially on social or digital media, could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands or if we experience a loss of consumer confidence in our brands, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nThe loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, consolidation of our customer base, as well as competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our volumes or profit margins.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 14.4% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for 28.0% of Post Consumer Brandss net sales in fiscal 2022. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for 29.6% of Weetabixs net sales in fiscal 2022. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 36.6% of the segments net sales in fiscal 2022. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 31.9% of the segments net sales in fiscal 2022. For purposes of this risk factor, Walmart refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sams Club.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters, mass merchandisers and national restaurant chains. The competition to supply products to these high-volume customers is intense. We do not have long-term supply agreements with a substantial number of our customers, including our largest customers. Our customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations, which have resulted in mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers, including online food retailers, gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to this environment, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. Further, the traditional retail grocery outlets in the U.S. where certain of our businesses are concentrated have experienced slower growth in recent years than other retail channels, such as dollar stores, club stores and eCommerce retailers. This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect it to continue in the future. Our businesses may be adversely affected if such non-traditional retailers take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers, if we are unable to effectively participate in such channels or if our customers fail to find ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities to enable them to grow their businesses. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers business operations or financial performance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and its downstream impacts or the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature RTE cereal category, and the failure or weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, big box retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores primarily across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Ireland. Although the RTE cereal category experienced strong demand during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020 and continuing through the first half of fiscal 2021, the RTE cereal category had previously been experiencing weakness in recent years and the RTE cereal category has since returned to demand levels largely in line with pre-pandemic levels.\nContinuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products.\nSuccessful growth depends upon our ability to add new retail and foodservice customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio with new innovative and profitable products. This growth would include expanding the number of our products our customers offer for sale and our product placement. The expansion of the business of our existing segments depends upon our ability to obtain new customers or expand our business with existing, large-account customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand our business with existing, large-account customers or enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our businesses.\nSome of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, we periodically renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements in place at our facilities as such agreements expire, and we expect such agreements to be more difficult to negotiate due to, among other factors, heightened expectations from union members on wages, labor market conditions and inflation. As such agreements expire, if we are unable to enter into new agreements on favorable terms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into new agreements in a timely manner, and if new agreements are not reached, there could be interruptions in production at the respective facilities. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our businesses, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIn the event of a work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our businesses. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our businesses in the event of a work stoppage, and particularly in the case of a prolonged work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use and the products we produce and distribute (or have produced or distributed by third parties), as well as increase the costs of production. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, product detentions, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nAI occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In fiscal 2015, an AI outbreak occurred in the Midwest of the U.S., affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third party contracted flocks. In addition, in fiscal 2022, we were impacted by outbreaks of AI. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, diseases affecting livestock (including PEDV) occasionally impact sow supply, which could adversely affect our businesses, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nWe participate in the private brand food category, producing and distributing private label products, including through our ownership interest in 8th Avenue. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us, 8th Avenue or our or 8th Avenues customers to lose sales, which may require us or 8th Avenue to lower prices or increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, each of which would adversely affect our or 8th Avenues margins, businesses, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows.\nNational or international disputes, political instability, terrorism, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, suppliers, customers and information systems and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeopolitical events, national or international disputes, political instability, terrorism, war or armed hostilities, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may cause damage or disruption to our operations, international commerce and the global economy. The reactions of governments, markets and the general public to such events, including economic sanctions, tariffs and boycotts, may result in a number of adverse consequences for our businesses, suppliers and customers. Such events could lead to supply chain and transportation disruptions, constrained availability of raw materials and other commodities, inflation, increased commodity, energy and fuel costs, cyber attacks, breaches of information systems and other disruptions that could adversely affect our businesses and our customers and suppliers. Such events also could result in physical harm to our, our customers or our suppliers employees and property. In addition, such events could cause increased volatility in the capital markets, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any such events, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to capital markets, energy and freight costs, our supply chain, information security and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus and do not have significant direct exposure to customers in those countries, our businesses and operations have been negatively impacted by increased inflation, escalating energy and fuel prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of certain raw materials and other commodities, and declarations of force majeure by certain suppliers. These and other impacts have caused, and may continue to cause, an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that may be material.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include:\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\nunfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\nunfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country;\nunfavorable currency exchange rates, including those that may occur as a result of a public health crisis;\nchallenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including those that have been caused (in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic) or may in the future be caused by a public health crisis;\nthe occurrence of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause us or our distributors, third party manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity, acts of war or other armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.;\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations;\ncompliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such treaties, laws and regulations;\nunfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications;\nthe difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security;\nexposure to evolving regulations and stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters, which could have significant implications on our operations, products, marketing and disclosures;\nthe potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;\nincreased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and\nthe difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases.\nIn addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. (Brexit) in 2020 created uncertainty surrounding certain of our businesses. While many of the policies and procedures have become more certain as trading through Brexit has become normal course of business, we continue to plan for and mitigate risks to production post-Brexit. In addition, uncertainty remains as to whether the U.K. will make changes to the Northern Ireland protocol and any potential E.U. reaction to such changes, which could have an adverse effect on our businesses as it could lead to a trade war with the E.U. possibly suspending parts of the trade deal that removed tariffs and quotas for goods.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our businesses, reputation and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may increase the potential frequency or severity of any acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events. If any of these climatic events has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to disruptions in the availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats and other grain products, sugar, fruit, nuts, eggs, potatoes, sows and dairy products. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather or natural disasters may result in damage or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or our third party manufacturers operations, disrupt our supply chain or distribution channels, impact demand for our products or increase our insurance or other operating costs. Also, water is essential to our businesses and the safety of our products, and the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable availability of, or usage restrictions on, water of acceptable quality, which may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations.\nThe increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water, implement new sustainability initiatives and comply with additional disclosure obligations. If we or our customers, suppliers or third party manufacturers become subject to additional legal and regulatory requirements, or if we or they choose to voluntarily take climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, we may experience significant increases in our operating costs. Further, our businesses could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, shareholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental, social and governance matters, which may include adverse impacts on our ability to raise capital or reduced demand for our products. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting, or perceived failure to meet or delay in meeting, stakeholder expectations on environmental, social and governance matters or any perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to environmental, social or governance matters could lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our operations or our ability to raise capital, as well as expose us to regulatory and legal risks.\nStrategic Risks\nOur business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices or on terms that are favorable to us. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our businesses and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture.\nEvaluating potential transactions, including divestitures and joint ventures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support any acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary operating matters.\nOur corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf the transactions we undertook, and intend to undertake, relating to divestitures of our interest in BellRing do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we may incur significant tax liabilities.\nIn March 2022, we completed a series of transactions related to a divestiture of a substantial portion of our interest in BellRing, which included the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange. After the BellRing Distribution, we retained approximately 14.2% of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. On August 11, 2022, we completed the Debt-for-Equity Exchange. Immediately after the completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, we held approximately 3.4% of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. By March 10, 2023, we intend to transfer all of our remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock in exchange for certain of our debt obligations or otherwise to our shareholders on terms to be determined by us (the Additional Divestitures). Detailed descriptions of the transactions discussed in this risk factor are provided in Business in Item 1 of this report under the heading Recent Strategic Transactions - BellRing Brands, Inc.\nThe BellRing Distribution was conditioned upon the receipt of a tax opinion from our tax advisor which concluded that the BellRing Distribution, together with certain related transactions, such as the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange and any other Additional Divestitures, qualifies as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the IRC) and is eligible for nonrecognition within the meaning of Sections 355 and 361 of the IRC. The tax opinion was based on, among other things, then-current law and certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters and certain statements and undertakings made by us and Old BellRing. Any change in the then-current applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation, assumption, statement or undertaking to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. In addition, the tax opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) or the courts, and the IRS and/or the courts may not agree with the tax opinion. If the BellRing Distribution, the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the Debt-for- Equity Exchange or any other Additional Divestitures do not qualify as tax-free transactions for any reason, we may recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows.\nMoreover, if the BellRing Distribution is determined not to qualify for nonrecognition of gain and loss under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the IRC, each of our U.S. shareholders who received shares of BellRing Common Stock in the BellRing Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of BellRing Common Stock received by such shareholder in the BellRing Distribution. In the event that one of our shareholders is treated as receiving a taxable distribution pursuant to the BellRing Distribution, the distribution to such shareholder would generally be taxable as a dividend to the extent of such shareholders allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). To the extent the distribution exceeds such earnings and profits, the distribution would generally constitute a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholders tax basis in its shares of Post common stock, with any remaining amount of the distribution taxed as a capital gain.\nPursuant to a tax matters agreement among us, BellRing and Old BellRing (the Tax Matters Agreement), BellRing has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from certain events, actions or inactions that BellRing takes that could affect the intended tax-free treatment of the transactions as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, including causing any portion of the BellRing Distribution, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange or any other Additional Divestitures to be taxable to us. BellRings indemnification obligations to us are not limited by any maximum amount and such amounts could be substantial. If BellRing were required to indemnify us under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, BellRing may be subject to substantial liabilities and there is no assurance that BellRing will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, if and to the extent (i) the BellRing Distribution, the Debt-for-Equity Exchange and/or any other Additional Divestitures do not qualify as tax-free transactions, (ii) such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries, and (iii) BellRing is not required to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we will be entitled to periodic payments from BellRing equal to 85% of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of the assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries resulting from such failure. Any failure by BellRing to satisfy these periodic payments, which could be substantial, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe are subject to a number of uncertainties while PHPC pursues a partnering transaction, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nIn May and June of 2021, PHPC completed the PHPC IPO. PHPC Sponsor, our wholly-owned subsidiary, purchased $40.0 million of PHPC Units in the PHPC IPO. In addition, PHPC Sponsor purchased PHPC Private Placement Units substantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO and holds shares of PHPC Series F Common Stock. PHPC Sponsor purchased the PHPC Private Placement Units and PHPC Series F Common Stock for approximately $10.9 million. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023 (which may be extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances). We will be required to devote significant management and employee attention and resources to matters relating to PHPC while it pursues a partnering transaction. If PHPC is unable to consummate a suitable partnering transaction during the prescribed time frame, PHPC Sponsor would lose its investment in the PHPC Private Placement Units and PHPC Series F Common Stock, and we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders. Alternatively, in the event that PHPC is able to consummate a partnering transaction, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.\nThere has recently been heightened regulatory focus on SPACs, including recently issued accounting guidance and proposed SEC rules applicable to SPACs, resulting in substantial uncertainty in the SPAC markets. PHPCs pursuit of a partnering transaction in this uncertain SPAC environment may result in delays, reduced investor and acquisition target interest in SPAC transactions, additional costs as instrument terms are reevaluated, our management and employees needing to devote extensive attention and resources to these matters and the possibility that PHPC may not be able to consummate a suitable partnering transaction at all during the prescribed time frame. The accounting guidance applicable to SPACs could subsequently be revisited, potentially necessitating restatements of PHPCs financial statements, which could then impact and necessitate restatements of our financial statements. These matters have the potential to disrupt us from conducting business operations or pursuing other business strategies and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nOur Company has overlapping directors and management with PHPC, BellRing and 8th Avenue, each of which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests.\nSeveral of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of PHPC, BellRing and 8th Avenue, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of such other companies have fiduciary duties to that companys shareholders or stockholders, as appropriate. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more other companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in one or more of such other companies. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the other companies. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions;\nour management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses;\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\ndifferences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\nintegration may be more costly, time-consuming or complex or less effective than anticipated;\ninability to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\nwe may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nIn addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, we cannot assure you that these integrations will result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nThe value of our equity securities, including our retained interest in BellRing, is subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could make it difficult to dispose of some or all of our equity securities at favorable market prices.\nOur investments in the securities of any publicly-traded company, including BellRing, are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to such companys business and ownership of such companys common stock, some of which are disclosed in such companys filings with the SEC, as well as risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in the global economy and public equity markets generally. Any such risk or uncertainty may cause the share price of such companys common stock, and the value of our equity in such company, including our retained interest in BellRing, to decline, which could hinder our ability to dispose of our equity of such company, including our shares of BellRing Common Stock, at favorable market prices. We also may not be able to realize gains from our equity securities, and any gains that we do realize on the disposition of any equity may not be sufficient to offset any losses we experience.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. We had $5,969.3 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2022. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility had borrowing capacity of $730.3 million at September 30, 2022 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\ntrigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness;\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flows to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\nrequire us to use cash, shares of our common stock or both to settle any conversion obligations of our 2.50% convertible senior notes maturing in 2027 (the Convertible Notes), and require us to use cash to repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes if a fundamental change (for example, a change of control of the Company) occurs;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of adverse economic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions), public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\ncreate liens;\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities;\nmake investments and acquisitions;\nenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\nenter into new lines of business;\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of adverse economic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions) and public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30% of our revolving credit commitments. Our credit agreement permits us to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in our credit agreement.\nA default would permit the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and, with respect to our credit agreement, to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures and credit agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads to applicable reference U.S. Treasury notes on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. Further, our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to such facilities to meet their respective funding commitments. During the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result of negative economic conditions, including inflation,\nrising interest rates and lower consumer confidence, and the impacts of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, there have been periods, and there may in the future be periods, of increased volatility and pricing in the credit and capital markets. If such periods of increased volatility recur, it may become more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow money. These and other events affecting the credit and capital markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S. Our businesses also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy, whether resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its related downstream impacts, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine or otherwise. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations, limit our ability to expand our businesses or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt, and their financial resources and assets may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have designated 8th Avenue, PHPC Sponsor and PHPC and their respective subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not secure our obligations under our credit agreement. A substantial majority of the assets of PHPC are held in trust and are not available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness. In addition, 8th Avenue has entered into secured credit facilities that are separate from our credit agreement and senior note indentures and that restrict, among other matters, its ability to make distributions to us or engage in transactions with us. Accordingly, the financial resources and other assets of 8th Avenue, PHPC Sponsor and PHPC and their respective subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness or, if available, may be significantly limited.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to fund the settlement of Convertible Notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of periods of inflation, rising interest rates, recessions, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\nsales of assets;\nsales of equity;\nreductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in a sufficient amount, to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIncreases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability.\nInflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market and increased competition for skilled and talented employees have increased our labor costs, which have negatively impacted our profitability, and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2023, although there are some economic indicators beginning to signal an alleviation of wage pressures. Although we continue to develop and enhance opportunities for efficient work processes, including using robotic technology and other artificial intelligence capabilities, an inability to automate processes in our manufacturing and distribution facilities could cause this trend of increasing labor costs to continue. Labor costs also include the costs of providing medical and other health and welfare benefits to our employees as well as certain former employees. With approximately 10,420 employees as of November 1, 2022 (which excludes the employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by the costs of such benefits. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase in these costs could have a materially negative impact on our profitability.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are impacted by factors that are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. The downstream impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global supply chain, including inflation and labor shortages, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to timely obtain equipment and materials necessary to complete planned capital projects, some of which were delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future disruptions and uncertainties for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives or impact our ability to complete projects to reduce costs or improve efficiency on planned timelines. If the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we did not have debt outstanding under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility, and we had $6.4 million of variable interest rate municipal bond debt. In the future, we may have additional debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. As a result, we may be adversely impacted by rising interest rates. Also, at September 30, 2022, we held derivative instruments whose market values are subject to changes in the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rate, as applicable. These derivative instruments have resulted, and may continue to result, in volatility in our financial results due to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, discontinued certain tenors of LIBOR in 2021 and intends to phase out the remaining tenors of LIBOR by June 30, 2023. The transition from LIBOR to other benchmarks has been the subject of private sector and governmental activity. During fiscal 2022, we amended our credit agreement to change the reference interest rate applicable to revolving loan borrowings in U.S. dollars from LIBOR to a rate based on the adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined in the credit agreement) and also to change the reference interest rate applicable to revolving loan borrowings in Pounds Sterling from a Eurodollar (that is, LIBOR) rate-based rate to a rate based on the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), an alternative benchmark interest rate. However, certain of our hedging transactions reference LIBOR as a benchmark in order to determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount.\nIt is unclear if alternative rates or benchmarks, such as SOFR and SONIA, will be widely adopted, and this uncertainty may impact the liquidity of the SOFR and SONIA loan markets. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment and on our borrowing costs. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and are not amortized. Management reviews all intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA (which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. Refer to Notes 2 and 8 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our goodwill and other intangibles.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to\nus or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also could be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits.\nWe maintain and contribute to qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses. With respect to those plans we maintain, we are obligated to ensure that these plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and our and PHPCs forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated and consolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and certain factors described in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance, and accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included herein relates to our historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers are injured.\nSelling food and beverage products involves a number of risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, allergens, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the ingredients used to make certain of our products, particularly eggs, pork, nuts, raw potatoes and grains, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. We may need to recall, withdraw or isolate some or all of our products if there is suspected or confirmed damage, adulteration, undeclared allergens, mislabeling, misbranding or other food safety concerns, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain or distribution network. Such an incident could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any product cause illness or injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of claims against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause\nproduction and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to a variety of laws and extensive regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities for both the countries where we manufacture or license products, primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and those where we distribute products, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, animal welfare, worker health and workplace safety. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Californias Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Internationally, we are regulated by, among other authorities, Health Canada, the U.K.s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed or licensed. Certain of our businesses are subject to heightened regulations. Specifically, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs.\nGovernmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy sourcing and usage, environmental and sustainability actions and disclosures, data privacy, immigration and labor issues, governmental assistance programs and other regulatory reforms, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our businesses or the businesses of our customers, suppliers or third party manufacturers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or interpretations thereof or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers, suppliers or third party manufacturers, causing our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, some states have passed laws or enacted regulations that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us incurring additional operating and capital costs in the future. In addition, there is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to packaging, environmental contaminants, climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and mandatory disclosures related to such topics. Compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations, strategy and supply chain management, which will likely require substantial time, attention and costs. The limited availability of government inspectors due to a government shutdown, government restrictions, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or closed borders also could cause disruption to our manufacturing facilities.\nIt is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties and revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with changing legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or permits, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter, institute enforcement actions or both, which could result in additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any claims, such as product liability or labeling claims, resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nTechnology failures or cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses.\nInformation technology is critically important to our operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and to manage and support our business processes and activities, including our manufacturing operations. We also depend upon our\ninformation technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third party manufacturers and suppliers. With an increasing number of employees working remotely in our workforce, our traditional network boundaries have been extended past our traditional physical facilities requiring that we protect our systems and data in environments that we do not control.\nIf we do not build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure or maintain or protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to, among other things, billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Our and our third party vendors information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, user error, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our businesses. If any of our or our third party vendors significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, competitive loss, litigation, reputational damage and other losses from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs.\nCyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by individuals and groups (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, fraud, identity theft, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, corporate or nation-state espionage, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Our networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our operating environment potentially resulting in cyber intrusions, hacks or ransom attacks with intent to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, vendor information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property (Cyber Events). Although we have not detected a material security breach to date, nor have we had material impact from breaches of our third party suppliers, we have had and continue to experience Cyber Events or other events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe implement and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the increasing use of personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information), the effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly. An information or cybersecurity incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. Over the past several years, there has been an increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and fees in defending such actions or asserting our rights, be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of pending or future litigation is often difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding personal information, data privacy, data protection and data security. Such laws, regulations, guidelines and principles impose varying obligations and requirements from country to country or, within the U.S., from state to state, which can create complexity in our compliance efforts. Our efforts to comply with such requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), require significant time and resources and impose significant challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing could result in substantial penalties or fines, regulatory proceedings, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction) to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the sale agreement, together with agreements related thereto, collectively referred to as the Restaurants Sale Agreement). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement.\nIn addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evanss restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guarantees relating to the leases on such restaurant properties (the Guarantees), which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. The Guarantees have subsequently been adjusted to 130 properties. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the Guarantees, we remain liable for payments due under any of the leases that remain in place if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations where we do not otherwise have adequate defenses under the Guarantees, the lease agreements or applicable law. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the Guarantees or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTermination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset to us. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements, confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections\nof intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesses. In addition, as certain of our trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are subject to licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert managements attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate environmental matters, including greenhouse gas emissions, water use and wastewater management.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the articles of incorporation), our amended and restated bylaws (the bylaws) and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\nour Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\nour Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board of Directors;\nelimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings;\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\nsupermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws;\nanti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the IRS or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in us. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the IRS, a foreign tax authority or a court will agree\nwith the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, announcements we make about our businesses, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, market data that is available to subscribers, reports by industry analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow us, industry or market trends, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, future sales of our common stock, to the extent any Convertible Notes are converted into shares of our common stock or cash or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nAs a result of such events or market volatility, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, this market volatility may impact our ability to raise capital through sales of our equity securities and may adversely affect the retentive power of our equity compensation plans, Further, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources.\nA shareholders percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly-traded company, our shareholders percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the vesting of those equity awards. For a brief discussion of our equity incentive plan, see Note 19 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition, any Convertible Notes converted into shares of our common stock may dilute the ownership of our then existing shareholders.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nPHPC, as a publicly-traded company, also is separately subject to SOX. Because PHPC is an emerging growth company (EGC) under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, its independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting under SOX. However, at the time that PHPC ceases to be an EGC, it also will be subject to this requirement under SOX. Further, if PHPC does not satisfy the requirements imposed by SOX, or if it does not have effective internal control over financial reporting, any such occurrences could impact our ability to satisfy our SOX requirements and could impair the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event that we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2022, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nActions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our businesses could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of Post Holdings, Inc. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under Item 8 of this report and the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report. The terms our, we, us, Company and Post as used herein refer to Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOn March 10, 2022, we completed the BellRing Spin-off (as defined below), which represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) and BellRing Distribution, LLC prior to the BellRing Spin-off have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following discussion reflects continuing operations only, unless otherwise indicated. See below for additional information.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in four reportable segments: Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail. Our products are sold through a variety of channels, including grocery, club and drug stores, mass merchandisers, foodservice, food ingredient and eCommerce.\nAt September 30, 2022, our reportable segments were as follows:\nPost Consumer Brands: North American ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal and Peter Pan nut butters;\nWeetabix: primarily United Kingdom (the U.K.) RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based ready-to-drink shakes;\nFoodservice: primarily egg and potato products; and\nRefrigerated Retail: primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products.\nTransactions\nBellRing Brands, Inc.\nOn October 21, 2019, Old BellRing (our subsidiary at the time) closed its initial public offering (the BellRing IPO) of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO, Old BellRing became a publicly-traded company, with the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock being traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the ticker symbol BRBR, and the holding company of BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BellRing LLC), owning 28.8% of its non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units) with us owning 71.2% of the BellRing LLC units and one share of Old BellRings Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock). Our ownership of the BellRing LLC units and the share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock gave us a controlling interest in Old BellRing following the BellRing IPO. This controlling interest resulted in the full consolidation of Old BellRing and its subsidiaries into our financial statements prior to the BellRing Spin-off, while the remaining interest in Old BellRings consolidated net earnings and net assets not held by us were allocated to noncontrolling interest (NCI) prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No.1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Spin-off Agreement), by and among us, Old BellRing, BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), we contributed our share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of our BellRing LLC units, and $550.4 million of cash to BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing and the right to receive $840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes and such transactions, collectively, the BellRing Contribution).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and we distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of our shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock), to our shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution (the BellRing Distribution). Our shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to our shareholders.\nUpon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus $2.97 in cash. The transactions described above, including the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger, as well as the Debt-for-Debt Exchange described under Liquidity and Capital Resources below, are collectively referred to as the BellRing Spin-off.\nImmediately following the BellRing Spin-off, we owned approximately 14.2% of the BellRing Common Stock and our shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the Old BellRing business as prior to the BellRing Spin-off. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders for United States (U.S.) federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock.\nOn March 17, 2022, we utilized proceeds received in connection with the BellRing Spin-off to redeem a portion of our existing 5.75% senior notes.\nOn August 11, 2022, we transferred 14.8 million of our remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of a Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources below). As of September 30, 2022, we owned 4.6 million shares of BellRing Common Stock, or 3.4% of the equity interest in BellRing.\nWe incurred separation-related expenses of $29.9 million during the year ended September 30, 2022 related to the BellRing Spin-off and subsequent partial divestment of our Investment in BellRing (as defined below). For additional discussion, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section. These expenses generally included third party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nFor additional information on the BellRing Spin-off, refer to Notes 4 and 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nInitial Public Offering of Post Holdings Partnering Corporation\nIn May and June of 2021, we and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation, a special purpose acquisition company (PHPC), consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units and such transaction, the PHPC IPO), of which PHPC Sponsor, LLC, our wholly-owned subsidiary (PHPC Sponsor), purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (PHPC Series A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0 million. The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols PSPC.U, PSPC and PSPC WS, respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023 (which may be extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances).\nSubstantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 million (the PHPC Private Placement). The PHPC Private Placement Units sold in the PHPC Private Placement are identical to the PHPC Units sold in the PHPC IPO, except that, with respect to the warrants underlying the PHPC Private Placement Units (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants) that are held by PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, such PHPC Private Placement Warrants (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption (except in certain circumstances when the PHPC Warrants are called for redemption and a certain price per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock threshold is met) and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of PHPCs partnering transaction. If the PHPC Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the PHPC Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by PHPC in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the PHPC Warrants.\nIn addition, we, through PHPC Sponsors ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share, have certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPCs certificate of incorporation.\nIn connection with the completion of the PHPC IPO, PHPC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor (the Forward Purchase Agreement), providing for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Forward Purchase Units), subject to the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPCs Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPCs partnering transaction.\nIn determining the accounting treatment of our equity interest in PHPC, management concluded that PHPC is a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation. A VIE is an entity in which equity investors at risk lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, the party who has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. PHPC Sponsor is the primary beneficiary of PHPC as it has, through its equity interest, the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses from PHPC, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impact PHPCs economic performance, including target identification. As such, PHPC is fully consolidated into our financial statements.\nAs of both September 30, 2022 and 2021, we beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within our financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, representing the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminate in consolidation.\nAcquisitions\nWe completed the following acquisitions during the reporting period:\nFiscal 2022\nLacka Foods Limited (Lacka Foods), acquired on April 5, 2022 and reported in our Weetabix segment.\nFiscal 2021\nPrivate label RTE cereal business of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (the PL RTE Cereal Business), acquired on June 1, 2021 and reported in our Post Consumer Brands segment;\nEgg Beaters liquid egg brand (Egg Beaters), acquired on May 27, 2021 and reported in our Refrigerated Retail segment;\nAlmark Foods business and related assets (Almark), acquired on February 1, 2021 and reported in our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments; and\nPeter Pan nut butter brand (Peter Pan), acquired on January 25, 2021 and reported in our Post Consumer Brands segment.\nFiscal 2020\nHenningsen Foods, Inc. (Henningsen), acquired on July 1, 2020 and reported in our Foodservice segment.\nDivestitures\nWe completed the sale of the Willamette Egg Farms business (the WEF Transaction) on December 1, 2021. Prior to the WEF Transaction, Willamette Egg Farms operating results were reported in our Refrigerated Retail segment.\nCOVID-19\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our businesses. We have experienced higher demand in our foodservice business during fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 as away-from-home food demand has continued to recover from the impacts of the pandemic. While foodservice volumes remain slightly below pre-pandemic levels, we continue to expect foodservice profitability will return to pre-pandemic levels in fiscal 2023. Our products sold through retail channels generally experienced an uplift in sales through the first half of fiscal 2021, driven by increased at-home consumption in reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, and returned to normalized levels in fiscal 2022. We have experienced inflationary headwinds across all segments of our business and we continue to mitigate these impacts through sales price increases and cost saving measures. We expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2023.\nAs the overall economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, uncertainty remains and such trends ultimately depend on the length and severity of the pandemic and introduction of new strains and variants of the virus;\nthe federal, state, and local government actions taken in response; and the macroeconomic environment. We have experienced some challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including labor shortages, input and freight inflation and other supply chain disruptions, including input availability. We cannot predict the ultimate impact from the COVID-19 pandemic on customer and consumer demand, our suppliers or the labor market.\nFor additional discussion, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section, as well as Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nConflict in Ukraine\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the subsequent economic sanctions imposed by some countries have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on fuel, transportation and commodity costs and may cause supply and demand disruptions in the markets we serve, including Europe. While we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus and do not have significant direct exposure to customers or suppliers in those countries, our businesses and operations have been negatively impacted by increased inflation, escalating energy and fuel prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of certain raw materials and other commodities, and declarations of force majeure by certain suppliers during fiscal 2022. We expect certain energy costs and raw material costs to remain elevated as a result of the ongoing conflict. To date, the economic sanctions imposed on Russian businesses have not had a direct impact on our procurement of energy and raw materials, however, there can be no assurance that additional sanctions will not be implemented. If our energy and raw materials purchases are directly impacted by sanctions, we may incur additional costs to procure such commodities. Our ability to procure energy and raw materials in the quantities necessary for the normal operations of our business may be limited. In addition, the U.K. government has established an energy price cap, which is currently keeping our U.K.-based business energy costs below prevailing market rates. The price cap is set to expire in April 2023, after which energy costs to operate our U.K.-based facilities could increase materially.\nAvian Influenza\nDuring fiscal 2022 and continuing into fiscal 2023, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments were impacted by outbreaks of avian influenza (AI). As a result of AI, we have incurred, and anticipate will continue to incur, increased costs related to production inefficiencies, egg supply constraints and higher market-based egg prices due to the decreased availability of eggs on the open market. We have mitigated, and plan to continue to mitigate, these increased costs through the management of volume needs with customers and pricing actions to cover the higher cost structure. Through these actions, we anticipate we will continue to mitigate the impact of AI on the profitability of our egg business. However, these actions do not contemplate further AI outbreaks, and we expect AI to have continued impact on our egg business.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nfavorable/(unfavorable) favorable/(unfavorable)\ndollars in millions 2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2021 2020 $ Change % Change\nNet Sales\n$ 5,851.2 $ 4,980.7 $ 870.5 17 % $ 4,980.7 $ 4,711.0 $ 269.7 6 %\nOperating Profit $ 415.6 $ 487.7 $ (72.1) (15) % $ 487.7 $ 536.5 $ (48.8) (9) %\nInterest expense, net 317.8 332.6 14.8 4 % 332.6 333.9 1.3 - %\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net (72.6) 93.2 165.8 178 % 93.2 72.9 (20.3) (28) %\n(Income) expense on swaps, net (268.0) (122.8) 145.2 118 % (122.8) 187.1 309.9 166 %\nGain on investment in BellRing (437.1) - 437.1 n/a - - - n/a\nOther income, net (19.8) (29.3) (9.5) (32) % (29.3) (11.5) 17.8 155 %\nIncome tax expense (benefit) 85.7 58.2 (27.5) (47) % 58.2 (21.3) (79.5) (373) %\nEquity method loss, net of tax 67.1 43.9 (23.2) (53) % 43.9 30.9 (13.0) (42) %\nLess: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 7.5 7.0 (0.5) (7) % 7.0 1.0 (6.0) (600) %\nNet earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interest 21.6 61.8 (40.2) (65) % $ 61.8 $ 57.3 4.5 8 %\nNet Earnings $ 756.6 $ 166.7 $ 589.9 354 % $ 166.7 $ 0.8 $ 165.9 20,738 %\nNet Sales\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nNet sales increased $870.5 million, or 17%, during the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was due to growth in our Foodservice, Post Consumer Brands and Refrigerated Retail segments, which included incremental contributions from our fiscal 2021 acquisitions. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nNet sales increased $269.7 million, or 6%, during the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was due to growth in our Foodservice, Weetabix and Refrigerated Retail segments, which included incremental contributions from our fiscal 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. These positive impacts were partially offset by a decline in our Post Consumer Brands segment. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nOperating Profit\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nOperating profit decreased $72.1 million, or 15%, for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was due to increased general corporate expenses and lower segment profit within our Refrigerated Retail, Weetabix and Post Consumer Brands segments, partially offset by increased segment profit within our Foodservice segment. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nOperating profit decreased $48.8 million, or 9%, for the year ended September 30, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to lower segment profit within our Post Consumer Brands and Refrigerated Retail segments, partially offset by increased segment profit within our Foodservice and Weetabix segments, as well as decreased general corporate expenses and other. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense decreased $14.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by a lower weighted-average interest rate when compared to fiscal 2021, lower average outstanding principal amounts of debt compared to the prior year and increased interest income. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 5.0% and 5.1% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest expense decreased $1.3 million, or less than 1%, for the year ended September 30, 2021, compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by a lower weighted-average interest rate when compared to fiscal 2020, decreased amortization of debt issuance costs, deferred financing fees and debt discount of $1.7 million and increased amortization of debt premium of $1.7 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by lower interest income of $5.6 million on our cash balances. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 5.1% and 5.3% for the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor additional information on our debt, refer to Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine have resulted in significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which the Company operates. At the time of this filing, the Company is unable to predict or determine the continued impacts that the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine may have on its exposure to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, among others. For additional discussion, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of this report, Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials, energy and fuel and supplies. The Company may use futures contracts and options to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the market price of the Companys principal hedged commodities, including natural gas, heating oil, soybean oil, corn, wheat and dairy, would have decreased the fair value of the Companys commodity-related derivatives portfolio by approximately $7 million and $17 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. This volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions. Because the Company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit, all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying exposures.\nFor more information regarding the Companys commodity derivative contracts, refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Post Holdings, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment- Refrigerated Retail reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2022 the Companys goodwill balance was $4,349.6 million and the goodwill associated with the Refrigerated Retail segment was $755.0 million, of which a significant portion pertains to the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit. Management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples based on market data.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rate, the revenue market multiple and the EBITDA market multiple, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches used to estimate fair value, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approaches, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rate, the revenue market multiple and the EBITDA market multiple. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue and profitability involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Companys income and market approaches, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate, the revenue market multiple and the EBITDA market multiple assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2011.\nPOST HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet Sales $ 5,851.2 $ 4,980.7 $ 4,711.0\nCost of goods sold 4,383.7 3,552.6 3,261.6\nGross Profit 1,467.5 1,428.1 1,449.4\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 904.7 807.0 782.5\nAmortization of intangible assets 146.0 143.2 138.1\nOther operating expense (income), net 1.2 (9.8) (7.7)\nOperating Profit 415.6 487.7 536.5\nInterest expense, net 317.8 332.6 333.9\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net (72.6) 93.2 72.9\n(Income) expense on swaps, net (268.0) (122.8) 187.1\nGain on investment in BellRing (437.1) -

See Note 4 for additional information regarding the BellRing Spin-off and discontinued operations.\nThe Company completed its acquisitions of the Egg Beaters liquid egg brand (Egg Beaters) and the Peter Pan nut butter brand (Peter Pan) on May 27, 2021 and January 25, 2021, respectively. The year-end close date for both Egg Beaters and Peter Pan was September 26, 2021. As the amounts associated with the additional four days were immaterial, results of these entities were not adjusted to conform with Posts fiscal calendar in fiscal 2021.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to previously reported financial information to conform to our current period presentation.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the operations of Post and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates and Allocations - The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require certain elections as to accounting policy, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for trade promotions, business combinations, pension and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Companys financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired over the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase.\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months.\nRestricted Cash - Restricted cash includes items such as cash deposits which serve as collateral for certain commodity hedging contracts as well as the Companys high deductible workers compensation insurance program.\nReceivables - Receivables are reported net of appropriate allowances for credit losses, cash discounts and other amounts which the Company does not ultimately expect to collect. To calculate an allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates uncollectible amounts based on a review of past due balances, historical loss information and an evaluation of customer accounts for potential future losses. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Receivables are written off against the allowance when the customer files for bankruptcy protection or are otherwise deemed to be uncollectible based upon the Companys evaluation of the customers solvency. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Weetabix segment sells certain receivables to a third party institution without recourse. Receivables sold during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $111.7 and $140.2, respectively.\nInventories - Inventories, other than flocks, are generally valued at the lower of average cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Reported amounts have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete product and packaging materials based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Flock inventory represents the cost of purchasing and raising chicken flocks to egg laying maturity. The costs included in our flock inventory include the costs of the chicks, the feed fed to the birds and the labor and overhead costs incurred to operate the pullet facilities until the birds are transferred into the laying facilities, at which time their cost is amortized to operations, as cost of goods sold, over their expected useful lives of one to two years.\nRestructuring Expenses - Restructuring charges and related charges principally consist of one-time termination benefits, severance, contract termination benefits, accelerated stock compensation and other employee separation costs. The Company recognizes restructuring obligations and liabilities for exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. Employee severance costs are expensed when they become probable and reasonably estimable under established severance plans.\nProperty - Property is recorded at cost, and depreciation expense is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the properties. Estimated useful lives range from 1 to 29 years for machinery and equipment; 1 to 35 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements; and 1 to 7 years for software. Total depreciation expense was $232.9, $222.2 and $206.7 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any gains and losses incurred on the sale or disposal of assets are included in Other operating expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Repair and maintenance costs incurred in connection with ongoing and planned major maintenance activities are accounted for under the direct expensing method. Property consisted of:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nLand and land improvements $ 92.2 $ 106.2\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 932.7 939.4\nMachinery and equipment 1,951.1 1,949.6\nSoftware 110.6 111.4\nConstruction in progress 182.7 111.3\n3,269.3 3,217.9\nAccumulated depreciation (1,517.4) (1,387.4)\n$ 1,751.9 $ 1,830.5\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets. The Company conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment assessment performed may be either qualitative or quantitative; however, if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units.\nThe estimated fair value is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable peers.\nSee Note 8 for additional information on goodwill and the annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. These fair value measurements fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 14.\nOther Intangible Assets - Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trademarks and brands acquired in business combinations and include both indefinite and definite-lived assets. Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets, which is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, was $146.0, $143.2 and $138.1 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of September 30, 2022, amortization expense of $145.0, $143.9, $142.6, $142.6 and $142.6 is expected for fiscal 2023, 2024, 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. Other intangible assets consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nCarrying\nAmount Accum.\nAmort. Net\nAmount Carrying\nAmount Accum.\nAmort. Net\nAmount\nSubject to amortization:\nCustomer relationships\n$ 2,129.7 $ (816.4) $ 1,313.3 $ 2,163.1 $ (716.4) $ 1,446.7\nTrademarks and brands\n647.7 (260.4) 387.3 647.9 (228.5) 419.4\n2,777.4 (1,076.8) 1,700.6 2,811.0 (944.9) 1,866.1\nNot subject to amortization:\nTrademarks and brands\n1,011.6 - 1,011.6 1,058.3 - 1,058.3\n$ 3,789.0 $ (1,076.8) $ 2,712.2 $ 3,869.3 $ (944.9) $ 2,924.4\nIn December 2021, the Company sold the Willamette Egg Farms business (the WEF Transaction). As a result, the Company recorded a write-off of $8.8 and $1.7 relating to customer relationships, net and trademarks, net, respectively. For additional information on the WEF Transaction, see Note 7.\nRecoverability of Assets - The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred which might impair the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets, including property, identifiable intangibles and right-of-use (ROU) assets.\nTrademarks with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trademark may be impaired. The trademark impairment test performed may either be qualitative or quantitative; however, if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the trademark, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test.\nThe quantitative trademark impairment tests require the Company to compare the calculated fair value of the trademark to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value is determined using an income-based approach, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, discount rates and royalty rates. Assumptions are determined after consideration of several factors for each brand, including profit levels, research of external royalty rates by third party experts and the relative importance of each brand to the Company. Revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by brand. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies. The Company conducted impairment reviews and concluded there were no impairments of any indefinite-lived assets during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020. These fair value measurements fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 14.\nIn addition, definite-lived assets (groups) are tested for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset (group) may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life is no longer appropriate. The Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. In general, an asset (group) is deemed impaired and written down to its fair value if the estimated related undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying amount. There were no indicators, including adverse trends in the business, that indicated that the carrying value of the Companys definite-lived assets (groups) were not recoverable in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nDeferred Compensation Investments - The Company funds a portion of its deferred compensation liability by investing in certain mutual funds in substantially the same amounts as selected by the participating employees. Because managements intent is to invest in a manner that matches the deferral options chosen by the participants and those participants can elect to transfer amounts into or out of each of the designated deferral options at any time, these investments are stated at fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 14). Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these assets are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the related change in the deferred compensation liability.\nDerivative Financial Instruments - In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials and supplies, interest rate risks relating to variable rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including (but not limited to) futures contracts,\noption contracts, forward contracts and swaps, to manage certain of these exposures by hedging when it is practical to do so. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe Companys derivative programs may include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative is designated as a hedge on the date in which the derivative contract is entered. A derivative could be designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments, where changes in their fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item and are not designated for hedge accounting.\nGains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI) and are reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item. If a derivative is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value are recorded in OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the foreign operation is liquidated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCash flows associated with all derivatives are reported as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, unless the derivative contains an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case its cash flows are reported as cash flows from financing activities.\nLeases - The Company leases office space, certain warehouses and equipment primarily through operating lease agreements. The Company has no material finance lease agreements. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. When the arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for them as a single lease component. Leases with an initial term of less than 12 months are not reported on the balance sheet, but rather are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Arrangements may include options to extend or terminate the lease arrangement. These options are included in the lease term used to establish ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company will reassess expected lease terms based on changes in circumstances that indicate options may be more or less likely to be exercised.\nThe Company has certain lease arrangements that include variable rental payments. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown and therefore are not included in minimum rental payments used to determine ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company has lease arrangements where it makes separate payments to the lessor based on the lessors common area maintenance expenses, property and casualty insurance costs, property taxes assessed on the property and other variable expenses. As the Company has elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components, these variable amounts are captured in operating lease expense in the period in which they are incurred. Variable rental payments are recognized in the period in which their associated obligation is incurred.\nFor lease arrangements that do not provide an implicit interest rate, an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is applied in determining the present value of future payments. The Companys IBR is selected based upon information available at the lease commencement date.\nROU assets are recorded as Other assets and lease liabilities are recorded as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs associated with finance leases and lease income do not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nRevenue - The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations have been satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is generally transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. At the time of delivery, the customer is invoiced using previously agreed-upon credit terms. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. The Companys contracts with customers generally contain one performance obligation.\nMany of the Companys contracts with customers include some form of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discounts. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Depending on the nature of the variable consideration, the Company uses either the expected value or the most likely amount method to determine variable consideration. The Company does not believe that there will be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers.\nThe Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration quarterly. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration.\nThe Companys products are sold with no right of return, except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged. No services beyond this assurance-type warranty are provided to customers. Customer remedies include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. As a result, the right of return and related refund liability is estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue based on historical sales return experience.\nCost of Goods Sold - Cost of goods sold includes, among other things, inbound and outbound freight costs (including the Company-owned fleet) and depreciation expense related to assets used in production, while storage and other warehousing costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Storage and other warehousing costs totaled $204.0, $167.7 and $160.4 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdvertising - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred except for costs of producing media advertising, such as television commercials or magazine and online advertisements, which are deferred until the first time the advertising takes place and amortized to the statement of operations over the time the advertising takes place. The amounts reported as assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $1.4 and $1.1 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation - The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability award. For liability awards, the fair market value is remeasured at each quarterly reporting period. The cost for equity and liability awards is recognized ratably over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award - the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Any forfeitures of stock-based awards are recorded as they occur. See Note 19 for disclosures related to stock-based compensation.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense (benefit) is estimated based on income taxes in each jurisdiction and includes the effects of both current tax exposures and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the related deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that the future benefits will not be realized. Reserves are recorded for estimated exposures associated with the Companys tax filing positions, which are subject to periodic audits by governmental taxing authorities. Interest incurred due to an underpayment of income taxes is classified as income tax expense. The Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested, so no United States (U.S.) taxes have been provided in relation to the Companys investment in its foreign subsidiaries. See Note 9 for disclosures related to income taxes.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share - The Company presents basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for both continuing and discontinued operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is based on the average number of shares used for the basic earnings (loss) per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method and convertible senior notes using the if-converted method.\nRemeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest (NCI) (as discussed in Note 5) are recognized as a deemed dividend. The Company has made an election to treat the portion of the deemed dividend that exceeds fair value as an adjustment to income available to common shareholders for basic and diluted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per share. In addition, dilutive net earnings from continuing operations was adjusted for interest expense, net of tax, related to the Companys convertible senior notes, and dilutive net earnings from discontinued operations was adjusted for the Companys share of Old BellRings consolidated net earnings prior to the BellRing Spin-off, to the extent it was dilutive. Net earnings (loss) from continuing operations was utilized as the control number to determine whether potential shares of common stock were dilutive or anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 3 - RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded there are no new pronouncements (other than the ones described below) that had or will have an impact on the Companys results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows, shareholders equity or related disclosures based on current information.\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires a company to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASU No. 2014-19, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) as if it had originated the contracts. The Company early adopted this ASU as of October 1, 2021 on a prospective basis, as permitted by the ASU. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. This ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The Company early adopted this ASU on October 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, respectively (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by Topic 848 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted Topic 848 on October 1, 2021. The adoption of Topic 848 did not have and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nNOTE 4 - BELLRING SPIN-OFF AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nBellRing Spin-off\nOn October 21, 2019, Old BellRing (the Companys subsidiary at the time) closed its initial public offering (the BellRing IPO) of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock). As a result of the BellRing IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the BellRing IPO, Old BellRing became a publicly-traded company, with the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock being traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the ticker symbol BRBR, and the holding company of BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (BellRing LLC), owning 28.8% of its non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units) with Post owning 71.2% of the BellRing LLC units and one share of Old BellRings Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock). The Companys ownership of the BellRing LLC units and the share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock resulted in the Company having a controlling interest in Old BellRing following the BellRing IPO. This controlling interest resulted in the full consolidation of Old BellRing and its subsidiaries into the Companys financial statements prior to the BellRing Spin-off, while the remaining interest in Old BellRings consolidated net income and net assets not held by the Company were allocated to NCI prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No.1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Spin-off Agreement), by and among Post, Old BellRing, BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing LLC units and $550.4 of cash to BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing and the right to receive $840.0 in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes and such transactions, collectively, the BellRing Contribution).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post consummated the BellRing Distribution, distributing an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock), to Post shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution. Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders.\nUpon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the BellRing Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus $2.97 in cash.\nImmediately following the BellRing Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2% of the BellRing Common Stock and Post shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the Old BellRing business as prior to the BellRing Spin-off. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free\ndistribution to Post shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock.\nThe Company incurred separation-related expenses related to the BellRing Spin-off and subsequent partial divestment of its Investment in BellRing (as defined below) (see Note 5) of $29.9 during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company incurred separation-related expenses related to the BellRing Spin-off of $1.6 during the year ended September 30, 2021. These expenses were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses within continuing operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Old BellRing incurred separation-related expenses prior to the BellRing Spin-off of $4.3 and $0.2 during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These expenses generally included third party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company utilized proceeds received in connection with the BellRing Spin-off to redeem a portion of Posts existing 5.75% senior notes (see Note 16).\nThe following is a summary of BellRings assets and liabilities as of March 10, 2022.\nMarch 10, 2022\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents (a) $ 50.6\nReceivables, net 120.0\nInventories 146.1\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 17.0\nProperty, net 8.7\nGoodwill 65.9\nOther intangible assets, net 214.4\nOther assets 10.3\nTotal Assets 633.0\nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt -\nAccounts payable 69.5\nOther current liabilities 40.5\nLong-term debt 938.8\nDeferred income taxes (b) 6.3\nOther liabilities 9.5\nTotal Liabilities 1,064.6\nBellRing Net Assets\n$ (431.6)\n(a)Excludes $115.5 of merger consideration paid to former Old BellRing stockholders immediately following the completion of the BellRing Distribution.\n(b)Excludes $127.1 related to Posts investment in BellRing Brands, LLC, which was contributed to BellRing and subsequently eliminated immediately following the completion of the BellRing Distribution.\nAs a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the Company recorded a $442.5 adjustment to additional paid-in capital, which included BellRing net assets of $(431.6). The BellRing Spin-off also resulted in a reduction of accumulated OCI associated with BellRings foreign currency translation adjustments. The total adjustment to accumulated OCI was $2.3.\nThe Companys equity interest in BellRing subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off (its Investment in BellRing), which was 14.2% immediately following the BellRing Spin-off, did not represent a controlling interest in BellRing. As such, the Companys remaining proportionate share of BellRings net assets were recorded at a zero carrying value on March 10, 2022, as the BellRing net assets were negative. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the subsequent sale of a portion of the Companys Investment in BellRing. See Note 14 for additional information regarding the Companys remeasurement of its Investment in BellRing to fair value at September 30, 2022.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe BellRing Spin-off represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Companys operations and consolidated financial results.

Each PHPC Unit consists of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share (PHPC Series A Common Stock), and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC, each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0. The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbols PSPC.U, PSPC and PSPC WS, respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC is required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023 (which may be extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances).\nSubstantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 (the PHPC Private Placement). The PHPC Private Placement Units sold in the PHPC Private Placement are identical to the PHPC Units sold in the PHPC IPO, except that, with respect to the warrants underlying the PHPC Private Placement Units (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants) that are held by PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, such PHPC Private Placement Warrants (i) may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) are not subject to being called for redemption (except in certain circumstances when the PHPC Warrants are called for redemption and a certain price per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock threshold is met) and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, will be subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of PHPCs partnering transaction. If the PHPC Private Placement Warrants are held by holders other than PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the PHPC Private\nPlacement Warrants will be redeemable by PHPC in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the PHPC Warrants.\nIn addition, the Company, through PHPC Sponsors ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC, $0.0001 par value per share, has certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPCs certificate of incorporation.\nIn connection with the completion of the PHPC IPO, PHPC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor (the Forward Purchase Agreement), providing for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Forward Purchase Units), subject to the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPCs Series B common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPCs partnering transaction.\nIn determining the accounting treatment of the Companys equity interest in PHPC, management concluded that PHPC is a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation. A VIE is an entity in which equity investors at risk lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, the party who has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. PHPC Sponsor is the primary beneficiary of PHPC as it has, through its equity interest, the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses from PHPC, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impact PHPCs economic performance, including target identification. As such, PHPC is fully consolidated into the Companys financial statements.\nProceeds of $345.0 were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPCs public stockholders consisting of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. A minimum balance of $345.0, representing the number of PHPC Units sold at the offering price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, is required by the underwriting agreement to be maintained in the trust account. These proceeds will be invested only in U.S. treasury securities. At September 30, 2022, there was $346.8 held in the trust account, which was included in Current investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the period in which PHPC has to complete a partnering transaction was less than twelve months as of September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2021, there was $345.0 held in the trust account, which was included in Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the period in which PHPC had to complete a partnering transaction was greater than twelve months as of September 30, 2021.\nThe public stockholders ownership of PHPC equity represents a NCI to the Company, which is classified outside of permanent shareholders equity as the PHPC Series A Common Stock is redeemable at the option of the public stockholders in certain circumstances. The carrying amount of the redeemable NCI is equal to the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the redeemable NCIs share of PHPCs net earnings or loss, OCI and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. The public stockholders of PHPC Series A Common Stock will be entitled in certain circumstances to redeem their shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock for a pro rata portion of the amount in the trust account at $10.00 per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock held, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to PHPC to pay taxes. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was recorded at its redemption value of $306.6 and $305.0, respectively. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable NCI are recognized as a deemed dividend and are recorded to Retained earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn connection with the PHPC IPO, PHPC incurred offering costs of $17.9, of which $16.9 was recorded to the redeemable NCI and $1.0 was reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2021. Of the $17.9 offering costs incurred, $10.7 were deferred underwriting commissions that will become payable to the underwriters solely in the event that PHPC completes a partnering transaction and were included in Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the initial valuation of the PHPC Warrants of $16.9 was recorded to redeemable NCI for the year ended September 30, 2021. For additional information on the financial statement impacts of the PHPC Warrants, see Notes 13 and 14.\nAs of both September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within the Companys financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, representing the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminate in consolidation.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of changes in the Companys redeemable NCI on the Companys equity. The period for the year ended September 30, 2021 represents the period beginning May 28, 2021, the effective date of the PHPC IPO, and ending September 30, 2021.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nPHPC IPO offering costs $ - $ (16.9)\nInitial valuation of PHPC Warrants - (16.9)\nNet earnings attributable to redeemable NCI 6.7 5.8\nRedemption value adjustment (1.6) -\nPHPC deemed dividend $ 5.1 $ (28.0)\nThe following table summarizes the changes to the Companys redeemable NCI.

In determining the accounting treatment of the common equity interest, management concluded that 8th Avenue was not a VIE as defined by ASC Topic 810, and as such, 8th Avenue was evaluated under the voting interest model. Based on the terms of 8th Avenues governing documents, management determined that the Company does not have a controlling voting interest in 8th Avenue due to substantive participating rights held by third parties associated with the governance of 8th Avenue. However, the Company does retain significant influence, and therefore, the use of the equity method of accounting is required.\nThe following table presents the calculation of the Companys equity method loss attributable to 8th Avenue. For the year ended September 30, 2022, 8th Avenues equity method loss attributable to Post exceeded the Companys remaining investment in 8th Avenue. In accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, the Company did not recognize equity method losses in excess of its remaining investment in 8th Avenue, which was $66.6 as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the Companys investment in 8th Avenue was zero.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2021 2020\nNet loss attributable to 8th Avenue common shareholders $ (60.6) $ (38.9)\n60.5 % 60.5 %\nEquity method loss attributable to Post $ (36.7) $ (23.5)\nLess: Amortization of basis difference, net of tax (a) 6.8 6.9\nEquity method loss, net of tax $ (43.5) $ (30.4)\n(a)The Company adjusted the historical basis of 8th Avenues assets and liabilities to fair value and recognized a basis difference of $70.3 upon the initial recording of its equity method investment in 8th Avenue. The basis difference related to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets was initially amortized over the weighted-average useful lives of the assets. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the Companys investment in 8th Avenue was reduced to zero, resulting in the termination of basis difference amortization in accordance with ASC Topic 323. At September 30, 2021, the remaining basis difference to be amortized was $47.8.\nSummarized financial information of 8th Avenue is presented in the following tables.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet sales $ 1,089.0 $ 900.8 $ 924.2\nGross profit $ 159.9 $ 132.3 $ 160.0\nNet loss $ (210.9) $ (24.3) $ (6.4)\nLess: Preferred stock dividend 40.4 36.3 32.5\nNet loss attributable to 8th Avenue common shareholders $ (251.3) $ (60.6) $ (38.9)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nCurrent assets $ 337.0 $ 282.8\nOther assets 746.6 903.0\nTotal Assets $ 1,083.6 $ 1,185.8\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ 6.5 $ 6.5\nAccounts payable and other current liabilities 166.3 131.7\nLong-term debt 862.4 780.0\nOther liabilities 54.1 63.0\nTotal Liabilities 1,089.3 981.2\nPreferred stock 138.3 97.9\nOther shareholders (deficit) equity (144.0) 106.7\nShareholders (Deficit) Equity (5.7) 204.6\nTotal Liabilities and Shareholders Equity $ 1,083.6 $ 1,185.8\nThe Company provides services to 8th Avenue under a master services agreement (the MSA), as well as certain advisory services for a fee. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recorded MSA and advisory income of $3.2, $3.5 and $3.9, respectively, which were recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had net sales to 8th Avenue of $8.1, $6.7 and $5.7, respectively, and purchases from and royalties paid to 8th Avenue of $102.9, $54.1 and $9.9 respectively.

The Companys Investment in BellRing represented 19.4 million shares of BellRing Common Stock, or 14.2% of the equity interest in BellRing, immediately following the BellRing Spin-off.\nOn August 11, 2022, the Company transferred 14.8 million shares of its Investment in BellRing to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of a Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Note 16). See Note 16 for additional information regarding the Debt-for-Equity Exchange. The Companys remaining Investment in BellRing as of September 30, 2022 represented 4.6 million shares of BellRing Common Stock, or 3.4% of the outstanding equity of BellRing.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys Investment in BellRing was recorded at its fair value of $94.8, and was included in Investment in BellRing on the Consolidated Balance Sheet (see Note 14).

Weetabix East Africa is a Kenyan-based company that produces RTE cereal and muesli. The Company owns 50.1% of Weetabix East Africa and holds a controlling voting and financial interest through its appointment of management and representation on Weetabix East Africas board of directors. Accordingly, Weetabix East Africa is fully consolidated into the Companys financial statements and its assets and results from operations are reported in the Weetabix segment (see Note 21).

Alpen is a South African-based company that produces RTE cereal and muesli. The Company owns 50% of Alpens common stock with no other indicators of control and, accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in Alpen using the equity method.

As of September 30, 2022, the Jefferson City Equipment was classified as held for sale and was reported as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIn the year ended September 30, 2021, a net gain on assets held for sale of $0.5 was recorded consisting of (i) a gain of $0.7 related to the sale of a Weetabix manufacturing facility in Corby, U.K. in November 2020 (the Corby Facility), (ii) a loss of $0.1 related to the sale of land and a building at the Post Consumer Brands RTE cereal manufacturing facility in Asheboro, North Carolina in November 2020 (the Asheboro Facility) and (iii) a loss of $0.1 related to the sale of the remaining portion of a Post Consumer Brands RTE cereal manufacturing plant in Clinton, Massachusetts in February 2021 (the Clinton Plant).\nIn the year ended September 30, 2020, a loss on assets held for sale of $2.7 was recorded consisting of losses of $2.6 and $0.1 related to the Clinton Plant and Asheboro Facility, respectively.\nThe above held for sale gains and losses were included in Other operating expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nNOTE 8 - GOODWILL\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are noted in the following table.\nPost Consumer Brands Weetabix Foodservice Refrigerated Retail Total\nBalance, September 30, 2020\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,011.8 $ 889.5 $ 1,335.6 $ 793.6 $ 5,030.5\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (48.7) (657.8)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,402.7 $ 889.5 $ 1,335.6 $ 744.9 $ 4,372.7\nGoodwill acquired 55.1 - 19.4 14.3 88.8\nCurrency translation adjustment 0.2 39.9 - - 40.1\nBalance, September 30, 2021\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,067.1 $ 929.4 $ 1,355.0 $ 807.9 $ 5,159.4\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (48.7) (657.8)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,458.0 $ 929.4 $ 1,355.0 $ 759.2 $ 4,501.6\nGoodwill acquired (a) - 13.9 0.3 - 14.2\nSale of business (b) - - - (4.2) (4.2)\nCurrency translation adjustment (0.3) (161.7) - - (162.0)\nBalance, September 30, 2022\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,066.8 $ 781.6 $ 1,355.3 $ 803.7 $ 5,007.4\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (48.7) (657.8)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,457.7 $ 781.6 $ 1,355.3 $ 755.0 $ 4,349.6\n(a)In April 2022, the Company recorded $13.9 of goodwill related to its acquisition of Lacka Foods, and in January 2022, the Company recorded a final measurement period adjustment of $0.3 related to the Almark acquisition. For additional information on the Companys acquisitions, see Note 6.\n(b)In December 2021, the Company completed the WEF Transaction. For additional information on the WEF Transaction, see Note 7.\nThe Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020, as all reporting units subjected to the quantitative test passed during each year. At September 30, 2022, the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit and the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit fair values exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6.5% and 8.5%, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the estimated fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%. At September 30, 2021, the estimated fair values of all such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 11% (the lowest of which was Foodservice; all others exceeded their carrying values by at least 15%). At September 30, 2020, the estimated fair values of all such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 4% (the lowest of which was Foodservice; all others exceeded their carrying values by at least 13%).\nThe fair values of the Cheese and Dairy and Refrigerated Retail reporting units at September 30, 2022 were impacted by raw material cost inflation and supply constraints, which impacted near-term profitability. The Company expects these impacts to be transitory in nature; however, inherent risk to their respective cash flows remains. Variances between the actual performance of the businesses and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimates of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods. Factors that could create variances in the estimated fair value of the reporting units include but are not limited to (i) fluctuations in forecasted sales volumes, which can be driven by external factors affecting demand such as changes in consumer preferences and consumer responses to marketing and pricing strategy, (ii) changes in product costs, including commodities, (iii) a significant change in profitability, (iv) interest rate fluctuations and (v) currency fluctuations.\nNOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES\nThe components of Earnings (Loss) before Income Taxes and Equity Method Loss on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other summary information is presented in the following table.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nDomestic $ 799.9 $ 105.9 $ (146.5)\nForeign 95.4 108.1 100.6\nEarnings (Loss) before Income Taxes and Equity Method Loss $ 895.3 $ 214.0 $ (45.9)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 85.7 $ 58.2 $ (21.3)\nEffective income tax rate 9.6 % 27.2 % (46.4) %\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 71.1 $ (20.3) $ 9.2\nState 11.1 (0.2) 4.6\nForeign 13.2 10.5 9.0\n95.4 (10.0) 22.8\nDeferred:\nFederal (9.7) 22.6 (45.9)\nState - 3.4 (14.6)\nForeign - 42.2 16.4\n(9.7) 68.2 (44.1)\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 85.7 $ 58.2 $ (21.3)\nA reconciliation of income tax expense (benefit) with amounts computed at the statutory federal rate follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nComputed tax (21%)\n$ 188.0 $ 44.9 $ (9.6)\nEnacted tax law and changes in deferred tax rates 0.9 40.0 10.2\nGain on investment in BellRing (a) (91.8) - -\nNon-deductible compensation 5.9 5.4 4.5\nState income tax, net of effect on federal tax 10.3 1.7 (7.8)\nValuation allowances 1.4 2.9 6.1\nNet losses and basis difference attributable to equity method investment (14.1) (9.2) (6.5)\nIncome tax credits (1.9) (1.5) (2.6)\nRate differential on foreign income (10.2) (11.0) (10.7)\nExcess tax benefits for share-based payments (3.6) (6.1) (1.3)\nGain on bargain purchase - (2.4) (2.5)\nEnhanced deduction for food donations (1.0) (0.8) (1.3)\nReturn-to-provision and changes in prior year accruals (0.5) (2.8) (1.4)\nOther, net (none in excess of 5% of statutory tax)\n2.3 (2.9) 1.6\nIncome tax expense (benefit) $ 85.7 $ 58.2 $ (21.3)\n(a)No deferred income taxes have been recorded with respect to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment on the Companys Investment in BellRing during the year ended September 30, 2022, as the Company expects to fully divest, and has already partially divested through the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, its remaining Investment in BellRing within 12 months of the BellRing Spin-off in a manner intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Note 4 for additional information on the BellRing Spin-off.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Non-current deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nAssets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net\nDerivatives and mark-to-market adjustments $ 34.9 $ - $ 34.9 $ 100.0 $ - $ 100.0\nDisallowed interest carryforwards 55.4 - 55.4 34.2 - 34.2\nLease liabilities 35.8 - 35.8 31.9 - 31.9\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards 24.1 - 24.1 29.1 - 29.1\nStock-based and deferred compensation 19.9 - 19.9 17.5 - 17.5\nAccrued liabilities 7.0 - 7.0 9.4 - 9.4\nAccrued vacation, incentive and severance 6.2 - 6.2 8.2 - 8.2\nInventory 8.8 - 8.8 4.1 - 4.1\nIntangible assets - (611.4) (611.4) - (643.5) (643.5)\nProperty - (197.6) (197.6) - (218.7) (218.7)\nROU assets - (32.9) (32.9) - (30.0) (30.0)\nPension and other postretirement benefits (11.4) (11.4) - (21.7) (21.7)\nBasis difference attributable to equity method investment 4.6 - 4.6 - (11.8) (11.8)\nOther items 5.5 (1.8) 3.7 5.6 (1.8) 3.8\nTotal gross deferred income taxes 202.2 (855.1) (652.9) 240.0 (927.5) (687.5)\nValuation allowance (35.5) - (35.5) (41.6) - (41.6)\nTotal deferred taxes $ 166.7 $ (855.1) $ (688.4) $ 198.4 $ (927.5) $ (729.1)\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Companys $24.1 deferred tax asset for net operating loss (NOL) and credit carryforwards is comprised of U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $1.9, state NOLs of $13.5, foreign tax loss carryforwards of $5.3 and state credit carryforwards of $3.4. The expiration for the majority of these carryforwards are either greater than 10 years or are able to be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has offset approximately $13.4 of the state NOLs and all of the $5.3 of foreign tax loss carryforwards by a valuation allowance based on managements judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of those deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. In addition, as of September 30, 2022, the Company had a\ndeferred tax asset for disallowed U.S. interest expense of $55.4 subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j) limitations, which may be carried forward indefinitely. Based on managements judgement, with the exception of a $4.8 valuation allowance recorded for state-related disallowed interest carryforwards, it is more likely than not that the Company will recognize the benefit of this deferred tax asset in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had a recognized valuation allowance of $35.5 and $41.6, respectively, based on managements judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The changes in the valuation allowance during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $(6.1), $0.5 and $8.5, respectively. These changes primarily relate to valuation allowances on state carryforwards.\nThe Company generally repatriates a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material. No provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries of $90.0 as of September 30, 2022, as it is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to, amongst other things, fund local operations, fund debt service payments, fund pension and other post-retirement obligations, fund capital projects and support foreign growth initiatives, including potential acquisitions. If the Company repatriated any of the earnings, it could be subject to withholding tax and the impact of foreign currency movements. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable foreign withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings. Applicable income and withholding taxes will be provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered reinvested.\nU.K. Tax Law Changes\nIn fiscal 2021, the effective income tax rate was impacted by enacted tax law changes in the U.K., which included a provision to increase the U.K.s corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company remeasured its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the 25% U.K. corporate income tax rate for future periods and recorded tax expense of $0.9 and $40.0. Other changes made to the U.K.s tax laws did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. Additionally, in fiscal 2020, the effective income tax rate was impacted by enacted tax law changes in the U.K., which included a provision to increase the U.K.s corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19%. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company remeasured its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the 19% U.K. corporate income tax rate for future periods and recorded tax expense of $13.0.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Companys assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nUnrecognized tax benefits activity for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 12.5 $ 8.3 $ 8.6\nAdditions for tax positions taken in current year and acquisitions 0.1 0.3 0.2\nAdditions for tax positions taken in prior years - 5.2 -\nSettlements with tax authorities/statute expirations (0.9) (1.3) (0.5)\nBalance, end of year $ 11.7 $ 12.5 $ 8.3\nThe amount of the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would directly affect the effective income tax rate was $6.5 at September 30, 2022. The Company believes that, due to expiring statutes of limitations and settlements with tax authorities, it is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to approximately $0.2 within twelve months of the reporting date.\nThe Company computes tax-related interest and penalties as the difference between the tax position recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount previously taken on the Companys tax returns and classifies these amounts as components of income tax expense (benefit). The Company recorded income tax expense (benefit) of $0.1, $(0.5) and zero related to interest and penalties in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $0.6 and $0.5 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above.\nU.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdiction income tax returns for the tax years ended September 30, 2019 through September 30, 2021 are generally open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in each respective jurisdiction.\nNOTE 10 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for both continuing and discontinued operations.\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet Earnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations\nNet earnings (loss) from continuing operations $ 735.0 $ 104.9 $ (56.5)\nImpact of redeemable NCI - (11.0) -\nNet earnings (loss) from continuing operations for basic earnings (loss) per share $ 735.0 $ 93.9 $ (56.5)\nImpact of interest expense, net of tax, related to convertible senior notes 1.5 - -\nNet earnings (loss) from continuing operations for diluted earnings (loss) per share $ 736.5 $ 93.9 $ (56.5)\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations\nNet earnings from discontinued operations for basic earnings per share $ 21.6 $ 61.8 $ 57.3\nDilutive impact of Old BellRing net earnings from discontinued operations\n- (0.1) -\nNet earnings from discontinued operations for diluted earnings per share $ 21.6 $ 61.7 $ 57.3\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings for basic earnings per share $ 756.6 $ 155.7 $ 0.8\nNet earnings for diluted earnings per share $ 758.1 $ 155.6 $ 0.8\nshares in millions\nWeighted-average shares for basic earnings per share 60.9 64.2 68.9\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nStock options\n0.3 0.6 -\nStock appreciation rights\n0.1 0.1 -\nRestricted stock units 0.5 0.3 -\nMarket-based performance restricted stock units 0.1 0.1 -\nEarnings-based performance restricted stock units 0.1 - -\nShares issuable upon conversion of convertible senior notes 0.7 - -\nTotal dilutive securities 1.8 1.1 -\nWeighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share 62.7 65.3 68.9\nEarnings (Loss) from Continuing Operations per Common Share:\nBasic $ 12.07 $ 1.46 $ (0.82)\nDiluted $ 11.75 $ 1.44 $ (0.82)\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations per Common Share:\nBasic $ 0.35 $ 0.96 $ 0.83\nDiluted $ 0.34 $ 0.94 $ 0.83\nEarnings per Common Share:\nBasic $ 12.42 $ 2.42 $ 0.01\nDiluted $ 12.09 $ 2.38 $ 0.01\nThe following table details the securities that have been excluded from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted earnings (loss) per share for both continuing and discontinued operations as they were anti-dilutive.\nYear ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nStock options - - 1.6\nStock appreciation rights - - 0.1\nRestricted stock units 0.3 - 0.5\nMarket-based performance restricted stock units 0.1 - 0.2\nNOTE 11 - SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATIONS STATEMENT AND CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nAdvertising expenses $ 93.2 $ 112.3 $ 113.1\nResearch and development expenses 18.9 21.9 19.1\nInterest income (4.4) (0.6) (6.2)\nInterest paid 320.0 348.2 300.0\nIncome taxes paid 45.8 45.6 44.4\nAccrued additions to property 36.4 38.3 29.8\nNOTE 12 - SUPPLEMENTAL BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nReceivables, net\nTrade\n$ 499.4 $ 374.8\nIncome tax receivable\n17.4 57.2\nRelated party 4.4 4.6\nOther\n25.3 18.0\n546.5 454.6\nAllowance for credit losses (2.3) (2.2)\n$ 544.2 $ 452.4\nInventories\nRaw materials and supplies\n$ 130.9 $ 99.6\nWork in process\n21.1 19.2\nFinished products\n361.9 318.7\nFlocks\n35.2 39.1\n$ 549.1 $ 476.6\nOther Assets\nPension asset\n$ 93.9 $ 153.4\nOperating ROU assets 122.9 115.5\nOther investments 26.9 22.9\nDerivative assets 3.0 29.1\nOther\n20.1 27.1\n$ 266.8 $ 348.0\nAccounts Payable\nTrade\n$ 362.1 $ 369.1\nBook cash overdrafts\n53.3 1.5\nRelated party 26.1 1.2\nOther\n11.2 12.4\n$ 452.7 $ 384.2\nOther Current Liabilities\nAdvertising and promotion\n$ 47.2 $ 40.2\nAccrued interest\n69.5 68.1\nAccrued compensation\n63.4 41.7\nHedging liabilities\n25.9 127.7\nOperating lease liabilities 25.5 23.5\nAccrued freight 25.1 24.0\nOther accrued taxes 19.1 21.6\nOther\n94.3 68.2\n$ 370.0 $ 415.0\nOther Liabilities\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligations\n$ 45.6 $ 64.2\nDerivative liabilities 49.1 256.0\nAccrued compensation 33.1 36.1\nOperating lease liabilities 113.7 105.2\nOther\n25.4 46.4\n$ 266.9 $ 507.9\nNOTE 13 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials and supplies, interest rate risks relating to floating rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including (but not limited to) futures contracts, option contracts, forward contracts and swaps, to manage certain of these exposures by hedging when it is practical to do so. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Companys derivative instruments, none of which were designated as hedging instruments under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, consisted of:\ncommodity and energy futures, swaps and option contracts which relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next two years;\nforeign currency forward contracts maturing in the next year that have the effect of hedging currency fluctuations between the Euro and the Pound Sterling;\ninterest rate swaps that have the effect of hedging interest payments on debt expected to be issued but not yet priced, including:\na pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap maturing in May 2024 that requires monthly settlements;\nrate-lock interest rate swaps that require lump sum settlements with the first settlement occurring in July 2023 and the last in July 2026; and\ninterest rate swaps that mature in June 2023 and give the Company the option of pay-variable, receive-fixed lump sum settlements; and\nthe PHPC Warrants (see Note 5).\nInterest rate swaps\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company terminated $700.0 notional value of its rate-lock interest rate swap contracts. In connection with this termination, the Company paid $17.0, which was recorded in (Income) expense on swaps, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company also restructured two of its rate-lock interest rate swap contracts, which contain non-cash, off-market financing elements. There were no cash settlements paid or received in connection with these restructurings.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company restructured four of its rate-lock interest rate swap contracts, which contain non-cash, off-market financing elements. There were no cash settlements paid or received in connection with these restructurings.\nIn fiscal 2020, contemporaneously with the repayment of its term loan, the Company changed the designation of one of its interest rate swap contracts from a cash flow hedge to a non-designated hedging instrument. In connection with the de-designation, the Company reclassified losses previously recorded in accumulated OCI of $7.2 to Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2020.\nCross-currency swaps\nThe Company terminated $448.7 notional value of its cross-currency swap contracts that were designated as hedging instruments during fiscal 2020. In connection with this termination, the Company received cash proceeds of $50.3 during the year ended September 30, 2020, which was recorded to accumulated OCI. Reclassification of amounts recorded in accumulated OCI into earnings will only occur in the event U.K.-based operations are substantially liquidated.\nThe following table shows the notional amounts of derivative instruments held.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 September 30,\nCommodity contracts $ 145.0 $ 56.4\nEnergy contracts 23.7 45.9\nForeign exchange contracts - Forward contracts 3.2 -\nInterest rate swap 200.0 200.0\nInterest rate swaps - Rate-lock swaps 849.3 1,549.3\nInterest rate swaps - Options 332.6 -\nPHPC Warrants 16.9 16.9\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location and fair value of the Companys derivative instruments.

Reclassification of these amounts recorded in accumulated OCI into earnings will only occur in the event all U.K.-based operations are substantially liquidated.\nAt September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had pledged collateral of $2.8 and $6.4, respectively, related to its commodity and energy contracts. These amounts were classified as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 14 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement according to the levels in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2\nAssets:\nDeferred compensation investment $ 12.0 $ 12.0 $ - $ 15.5 $ 15.5 $ -\nDerivative assets 32.9 - 32.9 65.5 - 65.5\nEquity securities 32.1 32.1 - 28.9 28.9 -\nInvestment in BellRing 94.8 94.8 - - - -\n$ 171.8 $ 138.9 $ 32.9 $ 109.9 $ 44.4 $ 65.5\nLiabilities:\nDeferred compensation liabilities $ 33.7 $ - $ 33.7 $ 36.0 $ - $ 36.0\nDerivative liabilities 75.0 1.0 74.0 383.7 9.2 374.5\n$ 108.7 $ 1.0 $ 107.7 $ 419.7 $ 9.2 $ 410.5\nDeferred Compensation\nThe deferred compensation investments are primarily invested in mutual funds, and their fair value is measured using the market approach. These investments are in the same funds, or funds that employ a similar investment strategy, and are purchased in substantially the same amounts, as the participants selected investment options (excluding Post common stock equivalents), which represent the underlying liabilities to participants in the Companys deferred compensation plans. Deferred compensation liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants in cash, based on the fair value of participants selected investment options (excluding certain Post common stock equivalents to be distributed in shares) using the market approach.\nDerivatives\nThe Company utilizes the income approach to measure fair value for its commodity and energy derivatives. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves and forward prices. Foreign exchange contracts are valued using the spot rate less the forward rate multiplied by the notional amount. The Companys calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Refer to Note 13 for the classification of changes in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe PHPC Warrants were initially valued using the Monte Carlo Option Pricing Method. The initial fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as the fair values utilized significant unobservable inputs. However, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the PHPC Warrants were valued using the market approach based on quoted prices as the PHPC Warrants became actively traded on the NYSE during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and are now categorized as Level 1. For additional information on the PHPC Warrants, see Notes 5 and 13.\nEquity Securities and Investment in BellRing\nThe Company uses the market approach to measure the fair value of its equity securities. The Companys Investment in BellRing represented its 3.4% equity interest in BellRing as of September 30, 2022, which was measured at its fair value of $94.8 based on the trading value of the BellRing Common Stock on September 30, 2022. For additional information on the Companys Investment in BellRing, see Notes 4 and 5.\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nInvestments held in trust are invested in a fund consisting entirely of U.S. treasury securities. The fund is valued at net asset (NAV) per share, and as such, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, the investments have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. Investments held in trust are reported at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 5).\nThe Companys financial assets and liabilities also include cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable for which the carrying value approximates fair value due to their short maturities (less than 12 months). The Company does not record its current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of any outstanding borrowings under the municipal bond as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 approximated their carrying values. Based on current market rates, the fair value (Level 2) of the Companys debt, excluding outstanding borrowings under\nthe municipal bond (which are also categorized as Level 2), was $5,171.0 and $6,596.7 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which included $566.1 and zero related to the Companys convertible senior notes, respectively.\nCertain assets and liabilities, including property, goodwill, other intangible assets and assets held for sale, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No impairment charges were recorded for property, goodwill, definite-lived or indefinite-lived intangibles or assets held for sale during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nAt September 30, 2020, the Company had land and buildings classified as assets held for sale related to the closures of the Clinton Plant, the Asheboro Facility and the Corby Facility. The Company sold the Asheboro Facility, the Corby Facility and the Clinton Plant in fiscal 2021. The Clinton Plant and the Asheboro Facility were both reported in the Post Consumer Brands segment, and the Corby Facility was reported in the Weetabix segment. The Company sold the Klingerstown Equipment and entered into an agreement to sell the Jefferson City Equipment in fiscal 2022. The Klingerstown Equipment and the Jefferson City Equipment were reported in the Foodservice segment. For additional information on assets held for sale, see Note 7.\nThe fair value of assets held for sale was measured on a non-recurring basis based on the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. When applicable, the fair value is adjusted to reflect an offer to purchase the assets. The fair value measurement was categorized as Level 3, as the fair values utilize significant unobservable inputs. The following table summarizes the Level 3 activity.\nBalance, September 30, 2020 $ 7.3\nProceeds from the sale of assets held for sale (7.9)\nCurrency translation adjustment 0.1\nNet gain related to assets held for sale 0.5\nBalance, September 30, 2021 $ -\nTransfers of assets into held for sale 1.0\nNet gain related to assets held for sale 9.4\nProceeds from the sale of assets held for sale (10.3)\nBalance, September 30, 2022 $ 0.1\nNOTE 15 - LEASES\nThe Company leases office space, certain warehouses, manufacturing facilities and equipment primarily through operating lease agreements. The Company has no material finance lease agreements. Leases have remaining terms which range from 1 to 54 years and most leases provide the Company with the option to exercise one or more renewal terms.\nROU assets are recorded as Other assets and lease liabilities are recorded as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs associated with finance leases and lease income do not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location of the Companys operating leases.\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nROU assets:\nOther assets $ 122.9 $ 115.5\nLease liabilities:\nOther current liabilities $ 25.5 $ 23.5\nOther liabilities 113.7 105.2\nTotal lease liabilities $ 139.2 $ 128.7\nThe following table presents maturities of the Companys operating lease liabilities.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFiscal 2023 $ 32.1\nFiscal 2024 26.3\nFiscal 2025 20.4\nFiscal 2026 18.9\nFiscal 2027 14.5\nThereafter 64.3\nTotal future minimum payments $ 176.5\nLess: Implied interest 37.3\nTotal lease liabilities $ 139.2\nThe following table presents supplemental information related to the Companys operating leases.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease expense $45.5 $40.1 $38.0\nVariable lease expense 5.2 4.8 4.5\nShort-term lease expense 9.4 7.5 7.4\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 9 years 9 years 7 years\nWeighted-average IBR 5.26% 4.70% 4.46%\nOperating cash flows for amounts included in the measurement of the Companys operating lease liabilities for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $29.6, $28.4 and $26.0, respectively. ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $20.7, $33.8 and $5.3, respectively. Of the $33.8 ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2021, $27.7 related to the acquisition of Almark (see Note 5).\nNOTE 16 - LONG-TERM DEBT\nLong-term debt as of the dates indicated consists of the following:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n2.50% convertible senior notes maturing August 2027 $ 575.0 $ -\n4.50% senior notes maturing September 2031 1,270.5 1,800.0\n4.625% senior notes maturing April 2030 1,482.2 1,650.0\n5.50% senior notes maturing December 2029 1,235.0 750.0\n5.625% senior notes maturing January 2028 940.9 940.9\n5.75% senior notes maturing March 2027 459.3 1,299.3\nMunicipal bond 6.4 7.5\n$ 5,969.3 $ 6,447.7\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt 1.1 1.1\nDebt issuance costs, net 50.1 47.2\nPlus: Unamortized premium, net 38.5 42.2\nTotal long-term debt $ 5,956.6 $ 6,441.6\nDebt Transactions in Connection with BellRing\nOn March 8, 2022, the Company entered into a Joinder Agreement No. 1 (the First Joinder Agreement) by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of the Companys subsidiaries, as guarantors, the institutions constituting the Funding Incremental Term Loan Lenders (as defined in the First Joinder Agreement, referred to herein as the First Funding Incremental Term Loan Lenders), Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as sub-agent to the administrative agent.

With a portion of the net proceeds received from the issuance, the Company repurchased 1.1 million shares of its common stock in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers of the 2.50% convertible senior notes (or an affiliate thereof), as the Companys agent, and paid the fees and\nexpenses associated with the repurchase (see Note 20). The Company intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nThe initial conversion rate of the 2.50% convertible senior notes is 9.4248 shares of the Companys common stock per one thousand principal amount of notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $106.10 per share of common stock. The conversion rate, and thus the conversion price, may be adjusted under certain circumstances as described in the indenture governing the 2.50% convertible senior notes (the Indenture). The Company may settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at the Companys election.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the maturity of the loans under the Credit Agreement may accelerate and the agent and lenders under the Credit Agreement may exercise other rights and remedies available at law or under the loan documents, including with respect to the collateral and guarantees of the Companys obligations under the Credit Agreement.\n2020 Bridge Loan\nOn October 11, 2019, in connection with the initial public offering and formation of Old BellRing, the Company entered into a $1,225.0 bridge facility agreement (the 2020 Bridge Loan Facility) and borrowed $1,225.0 under the 2020 Bridge Loan Facility (the 2020 Bridge Loan). On October 21, 2019, BellRing LLC entered into a borrower assignment and assumption agreement with the Company and the administrative agent under the 2020 Bridge Loan Facility, under which BellRing LLC became the borrower under the 2020 Bridge Loan and assumed all interest of $2.2 thereunder, and the Company and its subsidiary guarantors (other than BellRing LLC and its domestic subsidiaries, who were subsidiaries of the Company at the time) were released from all material obligations thereunder. The Company retained the net cash proceeds of the 2020 Bridge Loan, and following the assumption by BellRing LLC of the 2020 Bridge Loan Facility, used the cash proceeds of the 2020 Bridge Loan to repay a portion of the $1,309.5 principal balance of its previously outstanding term loan. For additional information, see Repayments of Debt below.\nMunicipal Bond\nIn connection with the construction of a filtration system at the Companys potato plant in Chaska, Minnesota, the Company incurred debt that guarantees the repayment of certain industrial revenue bonds used to finance the construction of the project. Principal payments are due annually on March 1, and interest payments are due semi-annually each March 1 and September 1. The debt matures on March 1, 2028.\nRepayments of Debt\nOn June 27, 2022, the Company commenced a modified Dutch Auction tender offer to purchase up to $450.0 in aggregate cash consideration (excluding accrued interest) of its (i) 4.625% senior notes at a bid range of 81% to 88% of par and (ii) 4.50% senior notes at a bid range of 80% to 87% of par (collectively, the Tender Offer). The Tender Offer included a tender premium of 5% of par for holders who tendered their senior notes prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 11, 2022 (the Tender Premium). On July 26, 2022, the Company settled the Tender Offer and purchased $139.8 in aggregate principal amount, or approximately 8%, of its outstanding 4.625% senior notes at 87% of par, including the Tender Premium, and $381.8 in aggregate principal amount, or approximately 22%, of its outstanding 4.50% senior notes at 86% of par, including the Tender Premium, for aggregate cash consideration of $450.0, excluding accrued interest and fees. The Company paid tender fees of $1.7 in connection with the Tender Offer, which were included in (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe following table presents the Companys cash repayments of debt, net of discounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and associated gain or loss included in (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCash repayments of debt (Gain) Loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, Issuance Principal Amount Repaid Debt Discounts (Received) / Premiums Paid Write-off of Debt Issuance Costs /\nTender Fees Write-off of Unamortized Premium\n4.50% senior notes $ 529.5 $ (74.7) $ 6.0 $ -\n4.625% senior notes 167.8 (21.9) 1.1 (1.8)\n5.50% senior notes maturing in 2029 15.0 (1.2) 0.1 (0.2)\n5.75% senior notes 840.0 24.1 5.0 (13.3)\nSecond Incremental Term Loan 107.7 - - -\nMunicipal bond 1.1 - - -\n2022 Total $ 1,661.1 $ (73.7) $ 12.2 $ (15.3)\n5.00% senior notes $ 1,697.3 $ 74.3 $ 18.9 $ -\nMunicipal bond 1.0 - - -\n2021 Total $ 1,698.3 $ 74.3 $ 18.9 $ -\nTerm Loan $ 1,309.5 $ - $ 9.1 $ -\n5.50% senior notes maturing in 2025 1,000.0 41.3 8.7 -\nRevolving Credit Facility 500.0 - - -\n8.00% senior notes 122.2 8.5 0.7 -\nMunicipal bond 1.1 - - -\nCredit Agreement - - 0.8 -\n2020 Total $ 2,932.8 $ 49.8 $ 19.3 $ -\nThe following table presents the Companys non-cash repayments of debt, which are not included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and the associated gain or loss included in (Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of September 30, 2022, the Company was not required to comply with such financial covenant as the aggregate amount of the aforementioned obligations did not exceed 30% of the Companys revolving credit commitments.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for incremental revolving and term loan facilities, and also permits other secured or unsecured debt, if, among other conditions, certain financial ratios are met, as defined and specified in the Credit Agreement.\nNOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nAntitrust Claims\nIn late 2008 and early 2009, approximately 22 class action lawsuits were filed in various federal courts against Michael Foods, Inc. (MFI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and approximately 20 other defendants (producers of shell eggs and egg products and egg industry organizations), alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws in connection with the production and sale of shell eggs and egg products, and seeking unspecified damages. All cases were transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and/or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\nThe cases involved three plaintiff groups: (i) a nationwide class of direct purchasers of shell eggs (the direct purchaser class); (ii) individual companies (primarily large grocery chains and food companies that purchase considerable quantities of eggs) that opted out of various settlements and filed their own complaints related to their purchases of shell eggs and egg products (the opt-out plaintiffs); and (iii) indirect purchasers of shell eggs (the indirect purchaser plaintiffs).\nResolution of claims prior to fiscal 2022: Prior to fiscal 2022, MFI resolved the following claims, including all class claims: (i) in December 2016, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by the direct purchaser class for a payment of $75.0,\nwhich was approved by the district court in December 2017; (ii) in January 2017, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by opt-out plaintiffs related to shell egg purchases on confidential terms; (iii) in June 2018, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by indirect purchaser plaintiffs on confidential terms; and (iv) between June 2019 and September 2019, MFI individually settled on confidential terms egg product opt-out claims asserted against it by four separate opt-out plaintiffs.\nFiscal 2022: During September 2022, MFI settled the remaining pending claims for this matter on confidential terms, which had sought damages based on purchases of egg products by three opt-out plaintiffs.\nMFI has at all times denied liability in this matter, and no settlement contains any admission of liability by MFI. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company expensed $13.8 related to the September 2022 settlement, which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. No expense was recorded in the years ended September 30, 2021 or 2020 related to these matters. At September 30, 2021, the Company had accrued $3.5 for this matter, which was included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company had no accrual related to this matter as of September 30, 2022 as the settlement was paid prior to year end. Under current law, any settlement paid, including the settlements with the direct purchaser plaintiffs, the opt-out plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, is deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nOther\nThe Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information presently known, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, as well as from asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities (if any), are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, although it is difficult to estimate the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for compliance with regulatory matters, in the opinion of management, based upon the information currently available, the ultimate liability arising from such compliance matters is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nBob Evans Lease Guarantees\nHistorically, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (Bob Evans) guaranteed certain payment and performance obligations associated with the leases for 143 properties (the Guarantees) leased by the restaurant business formerly owned by Bob Evans (the Bob Evans Restaurant Business). The Guarantees remained in effect following the Companys acquisition of Bob Evans in 2018, but have subsequently been adjusted to 130 properties. In the event the Bob Evans Restaurant Business fails to meet its payment and performance obligations under these leases, subject in certain cases to certain early termination allowances, the Company may be required to make rent and other payments to the landlord under the requirements of the Guarantees. Should the Company, as guarantor of the lease obligations, be required to make all lease payments due for the remaining term of the leases subsequent to September 30, 2022, the maximum amount the Company may be required to pay is equal to the annual rent amount for the remainder of the lease terms. The current annual rent on these leases is $12.9 and will increase up to 1.5% annually based on indexed inflation. The lease terms for the majority of the leases extend for approximately 15 years from September 30, 2022, and the Guarantees would remain in effect in the event the leases are extended for a renewal period. In the event the Company is obligated to make payments under any of the Guarantees, the Company believes its exposure is limited due to protections and recourse available in the leases associated with the leased properties, including a requirement of the landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the restaurants industry generally, including the Bob Evans Restaurant Business, the Bob Evans Restaurant Business was able to amend certain of its leases during fiscal 2020 in order to ensure that it continued to meet its obligations under these leases, and there is no indication that the obligations will not continue to be met. As such, the Company believes the fair value of the Guarantees is immaterial as of September 30, 2022.\nNOTE 18 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company maintains qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada for certain employees primarily within its Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments. Certain of the Companys employees are eligible to participate in the Companys postretirement benefit plans (partially subsidized retiree health and life insurance). The following disclosures reflect amounts related to the Companys employees based on separate actuarial valuations, projections and certain allocations. Amounts for the Canadian plans are included in the North America disclosures and are not disclosed separately because they do not constitute a significant portion of the combined amounts. With respect to defined benefits for Canadian Post Consumer Brands employees, eligibility is frozen to new entrants and benefit accrual is frozen for salaried employees. With respect to defined benefits for U.S. Post Consumer Brands employees, eligibility is frozen to new employees and the benefit accrual is frozen for all administrative employees and certain production employees. The benefit accrual is frozen for salaried Weetabix North America employees in the U.S. With respect to Weetabix employees in the U.K. participating in the executive and group\nschemes of the defined benefit pension plans, the plans are closed to new entrants and the benefit accrual is frozen with respect to existing participants.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the pension plans benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the two year period ended September 30, 2022 and a statement of the funded status and amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nNorth America Other International\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 133.3 $ 131.1 $ 821.3 $ 834.4\nService cost 4.3 3.9 - -\nInterest cost 3.5 3.2 15.7 15.2\nPlan participants contributions 0.4 0.4 - -\nPrior service cost (a) - 0.5 - -\nActuarial gain (38.9) (1.4) (251.6) (32.7)\nBusiness combinations - 0.5 - -\nBenefits paid (5.9) (5.8) (28.4) (34.7)\nCurrency translation (1.2) 0.9 (135.9) 39.1\nBenefit obligation at end of year $ 95.5 $ 133.3 $ 421.1 $ 821.3\nChange in fair value of plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 136.6 $ 121.5 $ 970.9 $ 993.2\nActual return on plan assets (27.1) 19.5 (273.0) (34.1)\nEmployer contributions 0.4 0.2 - -\nPlan participants contributions 0.4 0.4 - -\nBenefits paid (5.9) (5.8) (28.4) (34.7)\nCurrency translation (1.5) 0.8 (162.1) 46.7\nOther - - (0.1) (0.2)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year 102.9 136.6 507.3 970.9\nFunded status $ 7.4 $ 3.3 $ 86.2 $ 149.6\nAmounts recognized in assets or liabilities\nOther assets $ 7.7 $ 3.8 $ 86.2 $ 149.6\nOther liabilities (0.3) (0.5) - -\nNet amount recognized $ 7.4 $ 3.3 $ 86.2 $ 149.6\nAmounts recognized in accumulated OCI\nNet actuarial loss (gain) $ 5.0 $ 11.3 $ 40.2 $ (6.0)\nPrior service cost 0.6 0.7 10.7 11.1\nTotal $ 5.6 $ 12.0 $ 50.9 $ 5.1\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation\nDiscount rate - U.S. plans 5.65 % 3.05 % n/a n/a\nDiscount rate - Canadian plans 5.12 % 3.32 % n/a n/a\nDiscount rate - Other international plans n/a n/a 5.15 % 2.05 %\nRate of compensation increase - U.S. plans 3.00 % 3.00 % n/a n/a\nRate of compensation increase - Canadian plans 2.75 % 2.75 % n/a n/a\nRate of compensation increase - Other international plans n/a n/a 3.85 % 3.45 %\n(a)Amounts reported for the year ended September 30, 2021 represent the impact of fiscal 2020 union negotiations that were ratified subsequent to September 30, 2020.\nThe fair value of plan assets for the North American and other international pension plans exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation at September 30, 2022 and 2021.

The broad target allocations are 58.1% equity securities, 37.8% fixed income and bonds, 3.4% real assets and 0.7% cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2022, equity securities were 54.5%, fixed income and bonds were 33.9%, real assets were 2.9% and cash and cash equivalents were 8.7% of the fair value of total plan assets, 91.9% of which was invested in passive index funds. At September 30, 2021, equity securities were 61.4%, fixed income and bonds were 34.4%, real assets were 1.8% and cash and cash equivalents were 2.4% of the fair value of total plan assets, 97.8% of which was invested in passive index funds. The allocation guidelines were established based on managements determination of the appropriate risk posture and long-term objectives.\nThe expected return on other international pension plan assets was determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various asset classes, using the target allocation. The broad target allocations are 71.7% fixed income and bonds, 27.6% liability driven investments, 0.5% real assets and 0.2% cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2022, fixed income and bonds were 78.8%, liability driven investments were 18.7%, real assets were 0.4% and cash and cash equivalents were 2.1% of the fair value of total plan assets, 20.2% of which was invested in passive index funds. At September 30, 2021, fixed income and bonds were 72.6%, liability driven investments were 24.3%, real assets were 1.0% and cash and cash equivalents were 2.1% of the fair value of total plan assets, 31.3% of which was invested in passive index funds. The allocation guidelines were established by the trustees of the plan based on their determination of the appropriate risk posture and long-term objectives after consulting with management.\nThe following tables present the North American and other international pension plans assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement.

For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, service cost was reported in Cost of goods sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses and all other components of net periodic benefit cost were reported in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nService cost $ 0.5 $ 0.5 $ 0.6\nInterest cost 1.5 1.5 1.9\nRecognized net actuarial loss 0.6 1.1 0.6\nRecognized prior service credit (4.6) (4.7) (4.7)\nNet periodic benefit cost $ (2.0) $ (1.6) $ (1.6)\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net benefit cost\nDiscount rate - U.S. plans 2.89 % 2.79 % 3.20 %\nDiscount rate - Canadian plans 3.45 % 2.78 % 2.86 %\nRate of compensation increase - Canadian plans 2.75 % 2.75 % 2.75 %\nChanges in benefit obligation recognized in total comprehensive income\nNet (gain) loss $ (17.5) $ (4.3) $ 4.6\nRecognized net actuarial loss (0.6) (1.1) (0.6)\nRecognized prior service credit 4.6 4.7 4.7\nTotal recognized in OCI (before tax effects) $ (13.5) $ (0.7) $ 8.7\nFor September 30, 2022 measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the future per capita cost of covered health care benefits related to domestic plans for 2023 was 6.3% for participants both under the age of 65 and over the age of 65, declining gradually to an ultimate rate of 5.0% for 2028 and beyond. For September 30, 2021 measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the future per capita cost of covered health care benefits related to domestic plans for 2022 was 5.9% for participants both under the age of 65 and over the age of 65, declining gradually to an ultimate rate of 5.0% for 2026 and beyond. For both September 30, 2022 and 2021 measurement purposes, the assumed annual rate of increase in the future per capita cost of covered health care benefits related to Canadian plans for the following fiscal year was 4.5%, and will remain at this rate for 2023 and beyond.\nAdditional Information\nAs of September 30, 2022, expected future benefit payments and related federal subsidy receipts (Medicare Part D) in the next ten fiscal years were as follows:\n2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 - 2032\nPension benefits $ 24.3 $ 24.8 $ 25.9 $ 27.1 $ 28.2 $ 156.2\nOther benefits 3.2 3.4 3.4 3.4 3.5 17.9\nSubsidy receipts 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.2 0.2 1.1\nIn addition to the defined benefit plans described above, the Company sponsors a defined contribution 401(k) plan under which it makes matching contributions. The Company expensed $19.6, $19.9 and $18.4 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 19 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nThe Companys employees participate in various Company long-term incentive plans (the Long-Term Incentive Plans). On January 27, 2022, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan), which permits the issuance of stock-based compensation awards of up to 2.4 million shares, plus shares remaining to be issued under the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (including any shares assumed thereunder from the 2016 and 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plans) which were transferred to the 2021 Plan upon its effectiveness. Awards issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plans have a maximum term of 10 years. At September 30, 2022, there were 1.8 million shares remaining to be issued for stock-based compensation awards under the 2021 Plan.\nTotal compensation cost for the Companys cash and non-cash stock-based compensation awards recognized in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $66.4, $49.7 and $43.2, respectively, and the related recognized deferred tax benefit for each of those periods was approximately $9.1, $5.8 and $6.0, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the total compensation cost related to Posts non-vested awards not yet recognized was $78.5, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.\nBellRing Spin-off Impact\nIn connection with the BellRing Spin-off, adjustments were made to the terms of outstanding equity-based awards (the Equity Awards) to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards and to participants accounts under the deferred compensation plans maintained by the Company with respect to notional investments in Post common stock (the Deferred Compensation Accounts). The adjustments to the Equity Awards and Deferred Compensation Accounts were based on the volume weighted average price of a share of Post common stock during the five trading day period prior to and including March 10, 2022 and the volume weighted average price of a share of Post common stock during the five trading day period immediately following March 10, 2022.\nIn addition, certain market-based performance restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2020 to named executive officers of Post pursuant to the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan that were outstanding as of immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off (the Fiscal 2020 Market PRSUs) were converted into a number of time-based restricted stock units based on achievement of Posts total shareholder return ranking compared to such rankings of peer companies over a specified performance period ending on March 10, 2022. The vesting of the converted Fiscal 2020 Market PRSUs was subject to the requirement to remain employed through October 15, 2022, and otherwise remained subject to the terms and restrictions of the applicable award agreements.\nThe adjustments to the Equity Awards had an immaterial impact on the Companys Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. The disclosures regarding the Companys equity arrangements below include certain awards issued to BellRing employees in Post common stock prior to the BellRing IPO and still outstanding at the beginning of fiscal 2022.\nStock Appreciation Rights (SARs)\nin millions, except SARs or where otherwise indicated SARs Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per Share (a) Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm in Years Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 95,000 $ 46.59\nGranted -\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off 41,038 33.62\nExercised (54,484) 31.22\nForfeited -\nExpired -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 81,554 33.42 1.64 $ 4.0\nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 81,554 33.42 1.64 4.0\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 81,554 33.42 1.64 4.0\n(a)The weighted-average exercise price per share for activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\nUpon exercise of each SAR, the holder will receive the number of shares of Post common stock equal in value to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value at the date of exercise, less all applicable taxes. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised was $3.0, $3.2 and $0.1 during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no SARs granted during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nStock Options\nin millions, except stock options or where otherwise indicated Stock Options Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per Share (a) Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm in Years Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 889,096 $ 65.67\nGranted - -\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off 353,559 48.89\nExercised (231,340) 39.28\nForfeited - -\nExpired - -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 1,011,315 48.75 4.34 $ 33.5\nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 1,011,315 48.75 4.34 33.5\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 996,235 48.40 4.30 33.4\n(a)The weighted-average exercise price per share for activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\nThe fair value of each stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Model. The Company used the simplified method for estimating a stock option term as it did not have sufficient historical stock option exercise experience upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term was estimated based on the awards vesting period and contractual term. Expected volatilities were based on historical volatility trends and other factors. The risk-free rate was the interpolated U.S. Treasury rate for a term equal to the expected term. The weighted-average assumptions and fair values for stock options granted during the year ended September 30, 2020 are summarized in the table below. There were no stock options granted during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nExpected term (in years) 6.5\nExpected stock price volatility 29.2%\nRisk-free interest rate 1.8%\nExpected dividends 0%\nFair value (per stock option) $35.32\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $14.1, $46.4 and $5.5 in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $4.9, $7.6 and $3.9 during the years ended September 30, 2021, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 822,112 $ 97.23\nGranted 432,538 102.58\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off (b) 520,090 n/a\nVested (361,026) 91.68\nForfeited (64,908) 81.63\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 1,348,806 68.38\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\n(b)The Impact of BellRing Spin-off includes the adjustments to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off and the incremental RSUs from conversion of the Fiscal 2020 Market PRSUs.\nThe grant date fair value of each RSU award was determined based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested RSUs was $68.38, $97.23 and $89.14 at\nSeptember 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total vest date fair value of RSUs that vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $35.1, $49.8 and $42.1, respectively.\nCash-Settled Restricted Stock Units (Cash RSUs)\nCash RSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 29,400 $ 51.43\nGranted - -\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off 14,193 n/a\nVested (14,530) 34.68\nForfeited - -\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 29,063 34.68\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\nAt September 30, 2022, the 29,063 nonvested Cash RSUs were valued at the greater of the closing stock price or the grant price adjusted for the BellRing Spin-off of $34.68. Cash used by the Company to settle Cash RSUs was $1.1, $1.1 and $0.9 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEarnings-Based Performance Restricted Stock Units (Earnings PRSUs)\nEarnings PRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 7,526 $ 98.33\nGranted 195,533 104.74\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off 96,177 n/a\nAdjustment for performance achievement (b) (12,588) n/a\nVested - -\nForfeited (14,221) 78.27\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 272,427 70.46\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\n(b)Represents the adjustment to previously granted Earnings PRSUs for performance achievement.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted Earnings PRSUs to certain employees. These awards will be earned based on reaching certain earnings-based targets over a period ranging from one to three years. The grant date fair value of each Earnings PRSU award was determined based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and the assumption that the Company would meet the full earnings-based targets. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the earnings-based targets each quarterly reporting period and adjusts compensation cost accordingly. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested Earnings PRSUs was $70.46 and $98.33 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were no Earnings PRSUs granted during the year ended September 30, 2020, and there were no Earnings PRSUs vested during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nMarket-Based Performance Restricted Stock Units (Market PRSUs)\nMarket PRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 285,335 $ 142.61\nGranted 108,922 163.63\nImpact of BellRing Spin-off (b) 62,114 n/a\nAdjustment for performance achievement (c) (19,508) n/a\nVested (61,940) 122.34\nForfeited (521) 110.35\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 374,402 106.10\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off.\n(b)The Impact of BellRing Spin-off includes adjustments to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the BellRing Spin-off, offset by the conversion of the Fiscal 2020 Market PRSUs into RSUs.\n(c)Represents the adjustment to previously granted Market PRSUs for performance achievement.\nThe total vest date fair value of Market PRSUs that vested during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $6.6 and $3.9, respectively. There were no Market PRSUs vested during the year ended September 30, 2020.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company granted Market PRSUs to certain employees. As described above, the Fiscal 2020 Market PRSUs were converted into a number of time-based RSUs in connection with the BellRing Spin-off. The fiscal 2022 and 2021 Market PRSUs will be earned by comparing Posts total shareholder return (TSR) during a three year period to the respective TSRs of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon Posts ranking in its performance peer group when comparing TSRs, a recipient of a Market PRSU grant may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 260% of the target award. The fair value of each Market PRSU was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The assumptions for Market PRSUs granted during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 are summarized in the table below.\n2022 2021 2020\nExpected term (in years) 3.0 3.0 3.0\nExpected stock price volatility 27.7% 28.3% 22.2%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.9% 0.2% 1.6%\nFair value (per Market PRSU) $163.63 $152.58 $138.10\nDeferred Compensation\nPost provides deferred compensation plans for directors and key employees through which eligible participants may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of their compensation, or with respect to key employee participants, all or a portion of their eligible annual bonus, until a later date based on the participants elections. Participant deferrals for employee participants may be notionally invested in Post common stock equivalents (the Equity Option) or into a number of funds operated by The Vanguard Group Inc. with a variety of investment strategies and objectives (the Vanguard Funds). In order to receive a 33.3% matching contribution, deferrals for director participants must be made into the Equity Option. Deferrals into the Equity Option are generally distributed in Post stock for employees and cash for directors, while deferrals into the Vanguard Funds are distributed in cash. There are no significant costs related to the administration of the deferred compensation plans. Post funds its deferred compensation liability (potential cash distributions) by investing in the Vanguard Funds in substantially the same amounts as selected by the participating employees. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the related change in the deferred compensation liability. For additional information regarding deferred compensation, refer to Note 14.\nNOTE 20 - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nThe following table summarizes the Companys repurchases of its common stock.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nShares repurchased (in millions)\n4.9 4.0 6.1\nAverage price per share including brokers commissions (a) $ 90.04 $ 98.39 $ 97.67\nTotal cost including brokers commissions (b) $ 439.0 $ 393.7 $ 587.8\n(a)Average repurchase price per share including brokers commissions during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $103.81 prior to the BellRing Spin-off and $81.54 subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off.\n(b)Of the $393.7 total cost recorded during the year ended September 30, 2021, $4.0 was not settled until October 2021 and was included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2021.\nThe Company may, from time to time, enter into common stock structured repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds. Under such arrangements, the Company pays a fixed sum of cash upon execution of each agreement in exchange for the right to receive either a predetermined amount of cash or Post common stock. Upon expiration of each agreement, if the closing market price of Posts common stock is above the predetermined price, the Company will have the initial investment returned with a premium in cash. If the closing market price of Posts common stock is at or below the predetermined price, the Company will receive the number of shares specified in the agreement. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company entered into a structured share repurchase arrangement which required cash payments totaling $46.4, which were recorded as Cash paid for stock repurchase contracts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2020. This arrangement settled during the year ended September 30, 2021, and the Company received cash payments of $47.5, which were recorded as Additional paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2021 and as Cash received from share repurchase contracts in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNOTE 21 - SEGMENTS\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company managed and reported operating results through the following four reportable segments:\nPost Consumer Brands: North American RTE cereal and Peter Pan nut butters;\nWeetabix: primarily U.K. RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based RTD shakes;\nFoodservice: primarily egg and potato products; and\nRefrigerated Retail: primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products.\nDue to the level of integration between the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments, it is impracticable to present additions to property and intangibles and total assets separately for each segment. An allocation has been made between the two segments for depreciation based on inventory costing.\nAmounts reported for Corporate in the table below include any amounts attributable to PHPC.\nManagement evaluates each segments performance based on its segment profit, which for all segments is its earnings/loss before income taxes and equity method earnings/loss before impairment of property, goodwill and other intangible assets, facility closure related costs, restructuring expenses, gain/loss on assets and liabilities held for sale, gain/loss on sale of businesses and facilities, gain on/adjustment to bargain purchase, interest expense and other unallocated corporate income and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, Posts external revenues were primarily generated by sales within the U.S.; foreign sales were 12.5%, 14.3% and 14.5% of total net sales, respectively. The largest concentration of foreign sales was within the U.K., which accounted for 52.9%, 54.6% and 53.6% of total foreign sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales are attributed to individual countries based on the address to which the product is shipped.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the majority of Posts tangible long-lived assets were located in the U.S.; the remainder were located primarily in the U.K. and Canada, which combined have a net carrying value of approximately $253.6 and $300.2, respectively.\nIn the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, one customer, including its affiliates, accounted for 14.4%, 15.9% and 18.7%, respectively, of Posts total net sales. All segments, except Foodservice, sold products to this major customer or its affiliates.\nThe following tables present information about the Companys reportable segments. In addition, the tables present net sales by product.
