Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a development stage corporation with limited operations and no revenues from our business operations. We do not anticipate that we will generate significant revenues until we have raised significant funds. There is no assurance we will ever generate revenue even if we raised all necessary funds.\nGOING CONCERN\nOur financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. This means that we believe there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months.\nWe cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.\nWe have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.\nCRITICAL ACCOUTNING POLICIES\nPlease refer to Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenues.\nThe Company had revenues of $1,390,258 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, compared to $508,035 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Our costs of goods were $1,377,127 and $287,653 for the 12-month periods ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nExpenses\nOur operating expenses were $295,215 in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, and consisted of wages of $55,521, consulting fees of $28,049, professional fees of $5,030, and general and administrative expenses of $206,615. In the three months ended December 31, 2014, our operating expenses were $518,329, and consisted of wages of $82,679, consulting fees of $141,693, professional fees of $39.511, and general and administrative expenses of $254,446.\nWe had interest expense of $42,458 in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 as compared to net interest expense of $95,376 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014.\nOur net loss for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, was $1,018,006 compared to a net loss of $470,583 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014.\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the number of shares outstanding were 20,884,708 and 19,134,708, respectively\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, our total assets were $29,796 and $707,592, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, our total liabilities were $3,074,706 and $2,736,246, respectively.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nWe have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were $30,816. Cash flows used in operating activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, were $162,300.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe have not generated cash flows from investing activities for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, and 2014, respectively.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nWe have financed our operations primarily from either advancements or the issuance of equity and debt instruments. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $25,000. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2014, net cash from financing activities was $83,324.\nOther Income (Expense).\nWe had impairment of prepaid expenses of $693,464 in the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 and derivative expense of $77,260 in the 12 months ended December 31, 2014.\nPLAN OF OPERATION\nOur plan of operation for the following twelve months ending December 31, 2016 is to expand our historical operations:\nSouthern ITS International, Inc. provides proprietary equipment and services to support government regulated high compliance industries . This success is measured by the facts that the equipment and systems installed operated according to contract specifications and the warranties for said installations were provided by and supported by SITS . Government sectors (correctional facilities and programs), and private sectors, including gaming and now medical marijuana and recreational marijuana (MMJ/MJ), have had challenges, but have been brought into the mainstream and are now subject to stringent compliance to tough government regulations.\nSouthern ITS International, Inc. has historically developed and delivered to the gaming and corrections sectors high compliance support systems facilitating the integration and implementation of complementary technologies. SITS continues to deliver such electronic security and networking infrastructures to those clients.\nSITS is expanding to deliver the same quality of auditing and compliance technology to the emerging MMJ/MJ market sector that it delivers to other high compliance industries. Additionally SITS has and will continue developing new patent pending equipment and systems specifically addressing MMJ/MJ-related government and banking regulations and requirements. Specifically, addressing the FinCEN problems related to all cash businesses.\nOur market position in the Security Systems sector and in the MMJ Financial Security Systems sector is in the lower segment of service providers. We do not enjoy the position of a large service provider or a multi-state office system. We market to the industries through networking, telephone and print ads and Industry Conventions. We compete on the basis of pricing and flexibility of installation timing.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe Companys Financial Statements required by Item 8, are set forth on pages through of this report and are incorporated by reference in this Item 8.\nSOUTHERN ITS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nBalance Sheets at December 31, 2015 and 2014\nStatements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nStatements of Stockholders Deficit for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nStatements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\nNeither the financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nSOUTHERN ITS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 15,178\n$ 20,994\nAdvances to non-related parties\n10,000\n10,000\nPrepaids\n2,000\n673,150\nTotal Current Assets\n27,178\n704,144\nNon - Current Assets\nFixed assets\n2,618\n3,448\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 29,796\n$ 707,592\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$ 371,927\n$ 128,829\nAccrued interest\n458,244\n387,882\nConvertible notes payable - related party\n294,712\n294,712\nConvertible notes payable\n390,000\n375,000\nNotes payable - related party\n106,205\n96,205\nDerivative liability\n1,453,618\n1,453,618\nTotal Current Liabilities\n3,074,706\n2,736,246\nTOTAL LIABILITIES\n3,074,706\n2,736,246\nStockholders' Equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.001 par value, 10,000,000 shares authorized;\n5,000,000 shares issued and outstanding\n$ 5,000\n$ 5,000\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value, 50,000,000 shares authorized; 20,884,708 (2014-19,134,708) shares issued and outstanding\n20,885\n19,135\nAdditional paid-in capital\n6,098,117\n6,098,117\nAccumulated deficit\n(9,168,912 )\n(8,150,906 )\nTotal Stockholders' Equity:\n(3,044,910 )\n(2,028,654 )\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:\n$ 29,796\n$ 707,592\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\nNeither the financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nSOUTHERN ITS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the year ended\nDecember 31,\nRevenues\n$ 1,390,258\n$ 508,035\nCost of Goods Sold\n1,377,127\n287,653\nGross profit\n13,131\n220,382\nOperating Expenses\nConsulting\n28,049\n141,693\nProfessional fees\n5,030\n39,511\nWages\n55,521\n82,679\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n206,615\n254,446\nTotal operating expenses\n295,215\n518,329\nLoss from operations\n(282,084 )\n(297,947 )\nOther income/(expenses)\nInterest expense\n(42,458 )\n(95,396 )\nDerivative expense\n-\n(77,260 )\nInterest income\n-\nImpairment of prepaid expenses\n(693,464 )\n-\nTotal Other income/(expenses)\n(735,922 )\n(172,636 )\nLoss before taxes\n(1,018,006 )\n(470,583 )\nProvision for income tax\n-\n-\nNet loss\n(1,018,006 )\n(470,583 )\nBasic and dilutive net loss per share\n$ (0.05 )\n$ (0.02 )\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted\n20,884,708\n19,134,708\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements\nNeither the financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nSOUTHERN ITS INTERNATIONAL, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014\nAdditional\nPreferred Stock\nCommon Stock\npaid in\nAccumulated\nShares\nAmount\nShares\nAmount\nCapital\nDeficit\nTotal\nBalance, December 31, 2013\n5,000,000\n$ 5,000\n3,764,348\n$ 3,764\n$ 5,365,388\n$ (7,680,323 )\n$ (2,306,171 )\nStock cancelled J.

(formerly Alco Advanced Technologies, Inc.) (Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 27, 1984. On March 21, 2012, the Company changed its name from Alco Advanced Technologies, Inc. to Southern ITS International, Inc.\nThe Company executed a share exchange with Southern ITS Corporation (the Subsidiary) in which the result was Southern ITS becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Refer to Note 9 for more information. The Companys operations consist of providing turnkey integration of electronic security systems for various types of industries, such as transportation, gaming and other secure operations in both government and private sectors. The integration includes surveillance, access control, network infrastructure, data communications and fire and burglar alarm systems. Today, security technologies are evolving rapidly and require remote access through various networks, firewalls and internet security. Surveillance systems and access control are all network dependent and work best for the end user when they are completely integrated. The Companys mission is to provide a complete integration of the various electronic security systems with the computer networks that they are dependent upon and ensuring that the systems will remain secure from potential cyber attack.\nOn July 17, 2014, the Company enacted a 1-for-50 reverse stock split. The Company has adjusted all periods presented for the effects of the stock split.\nOn August 15, 2014, the Company amended its articles of incorporation to decrease its authorized shares of common stock from Two Hundred Fifty Million (250,000,000) shares to Fifty Million (50,000,000) shares, with a par value of $0.001. The Company remains to have Ten Million (10,000,000) preferred shares with par value of $0.001 authorized. The Company designated 10,000,000 Series A Preferred Stock which have preferred voting rights equal to 500 votes for each 1 preferred share.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nThe accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in The United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations.\nIt is managements opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year.\nRestatement of Financial Statements\nCertain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been adjusted to conform to the current period presentation pursuant to a 1 for 50 reverse stock split.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include all of the accounts of the Company and Southern ITS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 for the periods then ended. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nNeither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\nSuch estimates and assumptions impact, among others, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, due to continuing and expected future losses, and share-based payments.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nThe Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors. In circumstances where it is aware of a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations, it records a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what it believes will be collected. For all other customers, it recognizes reserves for bad debts based on historical experience. The company had an allowance for doubtful account balance of $0 at December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:\nLevel 1\nQuoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2\nPricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3\nPricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.\nNeither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nThe Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014; no gains or losses are reported in the consolidated statements of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date ended December 31, 2015 and,2014.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of 5 to 7 years. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations when incurred. Betterment and renewals are capitalized when deemed material. When property and equipment are sold or otherwise disposed of, the asset account and related accumulated depreciation account are relieved, and any gain or loss is included in operations.\nIntangible Assets\nValuation of intangible assets include significant estimates and assumptions such as estimating future cash flows from product sales, developing appropriate discount rates, estimating probability rates for the successful completion of projects, continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts, and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired.\nLong Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews the recover-ability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long-lived assets, including fixed assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recover-ability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition. The Companys estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance, growth rates and other factors. The actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from its estimates due to increased competition, changes in technology, fluctuations in demand, consolidation of its customers and reductions in average selling prices. If the carrying value of an asset is determined not to be recoverable from future operating cash flows, the asset is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) the collectability is reasonably assured. There are no price incentives and the product can only be returned if defective. As the Company does not believe defective merchandise is likely an allowance has not been recognized. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis with corresponding costs of goods as a reduction to revenue in cost of sales. The Companys subsidiary earned the majority of the Companys revenues in 2012 from installing network surveillance systems. The Company applies the percentage-of-completion revenue recognition principles of accounting when recording revenues for ongoing projects.\nRisks and uncertainties\nThe Company operates in an industry that is subject to rapid change. The Companys operations are subject to significant risk and uncertainties including financial and operational risks including the potential risk of business failure. Also, see Note 3 regarding going concern matters.\nSegment information\nDuring 2015 and 2014, the Company only operated in one segment; therefore, segment information has not been presented.\nNeither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nShare based payments\nGenerally, all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, restricted stock grants and stock appreciation rights, are measured at their fair value on the awards grant date, and based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. Share-based payment awards issued to non-employees for services rendered are recorded at either the fair value of the services rendered or the fair value of the share-based payment, whichever is more readily determinable. The expense resulting from share-based payments are recorded as a component of general and administrative expense.\nEarnings per share\nIn accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share, Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. At December 31, 2015, there were 30,166,314 potential dilutive shares outstanding which relate to the outstanding warrants with exercise prices below the closing trading price of the Companys stock as of December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires that the Company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefit (expense) results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nAccounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 740-20, Income Taxes - Intra-period Tax Allocation, clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-20 by prescribing guidance for the recognition, de-recognition and measurement in financial statements of income tax positions taken in previously filed tax returns or tax positions expected to be taken in tax returns, including a decision whether to file or not to file in a Particular jurisdiction. FASB ASC Topic 740-20 requires that any liability created for unrecognized tax benefits is disclosed. The application of FASB ASC Topic 740-20 may also affect the tax bases of assets and liabilities and therefore may change or create deferred tax liabilities or assets.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nOn January 15, 2014-The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, Intangibles-Accounting for Goodwill (Topic 350):. The Update simplifies the accounting alternative, if elected, to goodwill existing as of the beginning of the period of adoption and any new goodwill recognized in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014.\nIn April 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-17, Revenue Recognition - Milestone Method (Topic 605): Milestone Method of Revenue Recognition (codified within ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition). ASU 2013-45 provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for construction contracts.\nCompany management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial statements.\nNeither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $8,911,236 from inception (September 27, 1984) to December 31, 2015. Its ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to generate profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to address the going concern issue by funding future operations through the sale of equity capital and by director loans, if needed.\nThe Company is in the development stage and anticipates that it will be able to have profitable operations in the near future. The Company believes its current available cash, along with anticipated revenues, will be sufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that future financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue its operations is dependent on Managements plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements.\nThe Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Companys existence.\nThese financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nIn response to these problems, management has taken the following actions:\n\u00b7\nseeking additional debt and/or equity financing,\n\u00b7\ncontinue with development and implementation of the business plan,\n\u00b7\nassess business markets and related opportunities so that more significant revenues can be generated, and\n\u00b7\nallocation of sufficient resources to continue with service product marketing efforts.\nNOTE 4 - REVERSE STOCK SPLIT\nOn August 4, 2014, the Company executed a reverse stock split whereby the holders of stock in the Company, Southern ITS International, Inc., received one (1) post reverse stock-split share of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, in exchange for every fifty (50) shares of common stock (in effect, a 1 for 50 reverse split).

However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm its business. Southern ITS International has no pending or threatened legal proceedings or administrative actions either by or against the issuer that could have a material effect on the issuers business, financial condition, or operations and any current, past or pending trading suspensions by a securities regulator.\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn June 16, 2015 Southern ITS signed a surveillance system installation contract with a privately owned Casino Resort, located in the state of Mississippi. The currently stipulated contract amount is $1.5 million. Management feels that the final contract amount will potentially be higher, after system change orders are received during the project. The preliminary work on the project was begun in late June 2015, but management did not bill for any work until July. Revenues and costs of the project will be reported using the construction percentage of completion method, in the coming months.\nManagement is contesting certain trade accounts payable of approximately $25,000. The full amounts have been reported, but management will keep trying to reduce and resolve the outstanding balances.\nOn June 29, 2017, the Company and our President, Sylvain Desrosiers, entered into an Exchange Agreement with David McCovy whereby Mr. McCovy transferred 100% of the ownership interests in Evolution Enterprises, Inc. (Evolution) in exchange for 76,500,000 shares of common stock of Southern ITS International, Inc. As a part of the transaction, effective June 30, 2017 the Company returned the existing business, operations, assets and liabilities of the Company to Mr. Desrosiers and/or his designee, with the exception of $136,144 of promissory notes payable by the Company. Later in 2017, it was determined that Evolution had no value, and Mr. Desrosiers rescinded the Exchange Agreement. At the same time, Mr. McCovy was removed as President/CEO and a Director of the Company and Mr. Desrosiers re-assumed those positions. In October 2020 Mr. Desrosiers resigned and James E. Shipley was elected as the sole officer and director of Company. Subsequently, on July 13, 2022, the Company filed a lawsuit in Clark County Nevada District Court, Case no. A-22-855339-C, seeking cancelation of a total of 89,172,000 shares of its common stock, 76,500,000 shares of which were previously issued to Mr. McCovy arising out of the acquisition by SITS of Evolution in 2017. The remaining 12,672,000 shares of SITS common stock were caused to be issued by Mr. McCovy to his associates during the period of time that he served as CEO of the Company. Under its present management, the Company found no evidence of any payment of assets (other than the rescinded Evolution acquisition), or services received by the Company in exchange for issuance of the shares of common stock. Pursuant to a Court Order dated January 19, 2023, the Company and the Companys transfer agent canceled an aggregate of 86,225,000 shares of Company common stock, including the 76,500,00 shares owned by Mr. McCovy effective January 23, 2023.\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that no additional material subsequent events exist at the time of this report.\nNeither these financial statements nor the notes have been reviewed by our auditors Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding managements control objectives.\nOur management, with the participation of our CEO, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based upon this evaluation, our CEO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is described below.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2015. Our CEO concluded we have a material weakness due to lack of segregation of duties, a limited corporate governance structure, and a lack of a formal management review process over preparation of financial information. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nOur size has prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level of supervision and segregation of duties within our system of internal control. Therefore, while there are some compensating controls in place, it is difficult to ensure effective segregation of accounting and financial reporting duties. Management reported the following material weaknesses:\nLack of segregation of duties in certain accounting and financial reporting processes including the initiation, processing, recording and approval of disbursements;\nOur corporate governance responsibilities are performed by the Board of Directors, none of whom are independent under applicable standards; we do not have an audit committee or compensation committee. Our Board of Directors acts primarily by written consent without meetings which results in several of our corporate governance functions not being performed concurrent (or timely) with the underlying transactions, including evaluation of the application of accounting principles and disclosures relating to those transactions; and\nCertain reports that we prepare, and accounting and reporting conclusions reached in connection with the financial statement preparation process are not subjected to a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review and are not submitted timely to the Board of Directors for review or approval.\nWhile we strive to segregate duties as much as practicable, there is an insufficient volume of transactions at this point in time to justify additional full-time staff. We believe that this is typical in many development-stage companies.
