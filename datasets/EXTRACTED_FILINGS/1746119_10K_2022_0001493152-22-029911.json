All of the previous entities share the same exact business plan with the goal of developing and providing wellness and beauty services to our future clients. We aim to promote improved overall health and beauty in our clients through a holistic detoxification method.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, mainly supplies high quality spa services and spa care products.

The services provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function.\nSince our establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry is still in the early stage there is a huge potential for the industry to growth significantly.\nIn year 2020, COVID-19 crisis has resulted the sales of the global beauty and wellness industry weak due to consumers have had limited access to retail outlets and supply chain bottlenecks have reduced product availability. In China, the industrys sales fell up to 80 percent compared with 2019. Nevertheless, based on Mckinsey and Company research report on April 8, 2021, shows that consumers care deeply about wellness-and that their interest is growing and the global wellness market is estimated at more than US$1.5 trillion, with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities for companies, particularly as spending on personal wellness rebounds after stagnating or even declining during the COVID-19 crisis\nChina has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations in different cities and townships across the country, therefore, it is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a single business model.\nThe advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Companys early development in the Chinese market.\nThe first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted region.\nSecond, the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales and revenue growth.\nLastly, the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model, which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market operation and a win-win situation between the two parties.\nCurrently, the Company operates in the Chinese market with three business models:\n1. Tripartite co-operation and profit sharing model (deployment of stone spa bed & franchise)\n2. Large-scale chain agent model (deployment of stone spa bed)\n3.\nDirect- service store model\nOur Service\nDAY MORE STONE THERAPHY\n1. Bedrock Bathing/ Hot Stone Bath\nBedrock Bathing is a method of keeping the body in shape that involves bathers lying down on a heated slab of rocks embedded on a spa treatment bed without using hot water wearing indoor clothing. The original name for this hot stone bathing is \u2018Ganbanyoku, and it is originated from Japan as the term for a popular form of hot stone or bedrock spa. It is also referred to as stone-bathing, but there is no actual bathing or water involved.\nIt is our belief that the effects of bedrock bathing are numerous and both aesthetic and metabolic. Furthermore, the rocks selected for this treatment are believed to provide many health benefits when they are heated. The five stones we intend to use are: Black Silica Stone, Radium Stone, Far Infrared Stone, Negative Ion Stone and Beitou Stone. The average time taken for each therapy is approximately 30 minutes.\nThe Company believes that bedrock bathing treatments will assist in the elimination of suboptimal health conditions caused by polluted environments, unhealthy dietary intake, and unhealthy lifestyles. The detoxification process will improve general bodily function and immune system, promote blood circulation, and yield visible skin improvement. The treatment is also believed to improve basal metabolism, resulting in more efficient energy utilization within the body, hence sustainable weight loss to a desirable level. Prolonged proper treatments have also been linked to miscellaneous anti-aging benefits.\nOur pricing strategy offers great flexibility to our customers to opt for the service they desire which is also within their budget. In order to ensure flexibility, the Company has divided the service into three different tiers, each with different pricing strategy: Flagship, Luxury and Refined. Under the three tiers model, Flagship branch and will be the top tier and will target high-end segment with premium pricing packages. Luxury branch is designed to attract middle class individuals. Refined branch on the other side, will aim to attract customer with lower budget, but would still like to enjoy the service.\nThe Company started offering bedrock bathing services in the Shanghai outlet in January 2019. Different service packages are designed for each tier of service, which include option for subscription-based treatments, and pay per services. The packages offer customers either the option of purchasing our treatments at a discounted price if they purchase in bundle, or they can pay for the service every time they use at normal price. The bundle comprises of 3 different number of visits per bundle i.e., 10 times visit package, 20 times visit package, and 30 times visit package. We have also implemented a member database for our bedrock bathing centre. Customers can join our membership at an attracting fee to enjoy the services provided at member price. In addition to that, the Company also allows customers to purchase the services package via online and WeChat.\n2. Quartz Therapy\nChakras is within and parts of the human body that connects with the environment.

Once the thermostatic temperature adjustment device sets the default temperature, the user can activate the bed heating element after lying down on the stone spa bed. Following the closure of the cover cabin, the bed heating element will start heating from the default temperature to the users ideal degree of temperature. Once the session completes, the thermostatic control device will reduce the heating efficiency to the default temperature in order to maintain the heat for the next session, which can largely reduce the heating time and electricity cost-saving.\nFuture Plan\nMarketing Campaign and Publicity Enhancement\nUnder the groups marketing development plan, the Company will implement actively the major projects launched by the group, including Omni channel marketing project and nationwide franchised program, which the Company aims to attract at least 1,000 franchised stores.\nSince the opening of outlet shop in Shanghai, the shop has initiated the Omni-channel marketing projects, aiming to penetrate the market, and it has built a stronghold with the franchised stores and agents in multiple provinces across the country, including Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan and Guangdong province. The initial expansion of operation is based on the business model of profit sharing, and through this model, the Company has managed to expand the Hot Stone Bath therapy service into different health and wellness service provider outlets in different cities. The outlets span across different sub-segment of the health and wellness industry, which include beauty centre, post-maternity care centre, as well as high-end beauty salon. The Company targets to achieve the Omni-channel marketing projects by 2021, and the nationwide franchised program is expected to be achieved by 2023.\nIntelligent Marketing\nThe IT team in China has recently completed the development of Intelligent Health Evaluation Application System to provide support for the operation of Hot Stone Bath Therapy. Customers are now able to compare their health indicator through the mobile application and body fat measure device. The Company aims to build its own health indicator, recommend a personalized Hot Stone Bath therapy to the customers through the use of big data computation and analysis. By providing personalized service package, the Company believes it can effectively lead the consumers in making consuming decision, and consequently, the system will be upgraded to be a community marketing tool aiming to increase new customers flow and also retain existing customers.\nProduct Research and Development\nWhile the Company is seeking to expand the access to the China market, it is also actively promoting the research and development of products and technology. In addition to the introduction of new products, under the ongoing smart technology trend led by China, the business model of beauty and health industry has also experienced rapid changes in the emerging environment.

We hope to maintain a competitive advantage by utilizing the knowledge and expertise of the Company in the industry and our beyond satisfactory customer service.\nCustomers\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company has generated revenue amounted to $46,702 from customers under the ordinary course of business.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nHolders\nAs of July 31, 2022, we had 59,434,838 shares of our Common Stock par value, $.0001 issued and outstanding. There were 159 beneficial owners of our Common Stock.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nThe transfer agent for our capital stock is VStock Transfer, LLC, with an address at 18, Lafayette Place, Woodmere, New York 11598 and telephone number is +1 (212) 828-8436.\nPenny Stock Regulations\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted regulations which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. Our Common Stock, when and if a trading market develops, may fall within the definition of penny stock and be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000, or annual incomes exceeding $200,000 individually, or $300,000, together with their spouse).\nFor transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchasers prior written consent to the transaction. Additionally, for any transaction, other than exempt transactions, involving a penny stock, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market-maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealers presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. Consequently, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our Common Stock and may affect the ability of investors to sell their Common Stock in the secondary market.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit the investors ability to buy and sell our stock.\nDividend Policy\nAny future determination as to the declaration and payment of dividends on shares of our Common Stock will be made at the discretion of our board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose. We are under no obligations or restrictions to declare or pay dividends on our shares of Common Stock. In addition, we currently have no plans to pay such dividends. Our board of directors currently intends to retain all earnings for use in the business for the foreseeable future.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nCurrently, there is no equity compensation plan in place.\nUnregistered Sales of Equity Securities\nCurrently, there is no unregistered sales of equity securities.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Registrant and Affiliated Purchasers\nWe have not repurchased any shares of our common stock during the fiscal year ended July 31, 2022.

Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.\nRevenue recognition\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASC 606. The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The Company derives its revenue from provision of wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon.\nCost of revenues\nCost of revenue includes the cost of services and product incurred to provide wellness and beauty services and purchase of products.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.\nInventories\nInventories consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:\nClassification\nEstimated useful life\nLeasable equipment\nyears\nComputer hardware and software\nyears\nOffice equipment\nyears\nOutlet design fee and equipment\n3 years\nApplication development fee\n3 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nImpairment of long-live assets\nLong-lived assets primarily include trademark of the Company. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with ASC 842.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.\nIn determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nThe Company conducts major businesses in China and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authority.\nGoing concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company has generated revenue of $46,702 and continuously incurred a net loss of $357,333. As of July 31, 2022, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $2,389,181, capital deficiency of $533,364 and negative operating cash flow of $4,169. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its shareholders and director. Management believes the existing shareholders, director or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Companys obligations as they become due.\nThese and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern\nNet loss per share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nForeign currencies translation\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nThe reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiary is United States Dollars (US$) and the accompanying financial statements have been expressed in US$.\nIn general, for consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of its subsidiary whose functional currency is not US$ are translated into US$, in accordance with ASC Topic 830-30, Translation of Financial Statement, using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiary are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within the statements of shareholders equity.\nTranslation of amounts from RMB, TWD and HK$ into US$1 has been made at the following exchange rates for the respective periods:\nAs of and for the year ended July 31,\nYear-end RMB : US$1 exchange rate\n6.744\n6.461\nYear-average RMB : US$1 exchange rate\n6.476\n6.578\nYear-end HK$ : US$1 exchange rate\n7.850\n7.772\nYear-average HK$ : US$1 exchange rate\n7.811\n7.758\nYear-end TWD : US$1 exchange rate\n30.044\n27.972\nYear-average TWD : US$1 exchange rate\n28.500\n28.340\nRelated parties\nParties, which can be a corporation or individual, are considered to be related if the Company has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nFair value of financial instruments:\nThe carrying value of the Companys financial instruments: cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and amount due to a director approximate at their fair values because of the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\nThe Company also follows the guidance of the ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820-10), with respect to financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. ASC 820-10 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Most prominent among the amendments is the recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As required by the standard, the Company will adopt the provisions of the new standard effective November 1, 2019, using the required modified retrospective approach. We believe the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements required by this item are located in PART IV of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosures Control and Procedures\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on such evaluation, the management concluded that during the year covered by this Report, internal controls and procedures overall were not effective. This was due to the deficiencies existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022.\nWe do not have adequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment - Lack of segregation of duties and effective risk assessment may cause the Company to face the likelihood of fraud or theft, due to poor oversight, governance and review to detect errors.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, the management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022 based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives\nIn an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls, we have initiated, or plan to initiate, the following series of measures:\n1. We plan to create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function. The accounting personnel is responsible for reviewing the financing activities, facilitating the approval of the financing, recording the information regarding the financing, and submitting SEC filing related documents to our legal counsel in order to comply with the filing requirements of SEC.\n2. We intend to add staff members to our management team to make sure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed and submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and will the staff members will have segregated responsibilities with regard to these responsibilities.\nWe anticipate that these initiatives will be at least partially, if not fully, implemented by the end of fiscal year 2022.\nChanges in internal controls over financial reporting\nThere was no change in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the year covered by this Report, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting:\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered independent public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered independent public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In 2017, Ms. Niu established a cross-border e-commerce business, https://www.magicgo99.com, in order to reach consumers globally.\nMs. Niu Yen-Yens experience in corporate management and business development has led the Board of Directors to reach the conclusion that she should serve as President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of the Company.\nHsieh Chang-Chung- Chief Financial Officer\nIn 1985, Mr. Hsieh Chang-Chung received Master of Business Administration from Chung Yuan Christian University, Taiwan. From 1989 to 1992, Mr. Hsieh worked as the Special Assistant to the Chairman of Fu-I Industrial Group, a listed company in Taipei Stock Exchange.

(which was renamed to Kbro Co., Ltd. in 2006) in Taiwan. He then served as the Vice President and Chief Investment Officer of Head Office in Eastern Media International Group (EMI) from 2008 to 2016. From 2016 to 2019, Mr. Hsieh has served as the Senior Consultant of Eastern Media International Group (EMI) in Taiwan.\nMr. Hsieh Chang-Chungs corporate and financial experience has led the Board of Directors to reach the conclusion that he should serve as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nCorporate Governance\nThe Company promotes accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and in other public communications made by the Company; and strives to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. The Company has not formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that governs the Companys employees, officers and Directors as the Company is not required to do so.\nIn lieu of an Audit Committee, the Companys Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of external auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of the Companys financial statements and other services provided by the Companys independent public accountants. The Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company review the Companys internal accounting controls, practices and policies.\nCommittees of the Board\nOur Company currently does not have nominating, compensation, or audit committees or committees performing similar functions nor does our Company have a written nominating, compensation or audit committee charter. Our Director(s) believes that it is not necessary to have such committees, at this time, because the Director(s) can adequately perform the functions of such committees.\nAudit Committee Financial Expert\nOur Board of Directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(D)(5) of Regulation S-K, nor do we have a Board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(14) of the FINRA Rules.\nWe believe that our Director(s) are capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The Director(s) of our Company does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because management believes that the Board of Directors can adequately perform the functions of an audit committee. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent Director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstances given the stage of our development and the fact that we have not generated any positive cash flows from operations to date.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nOur Directors and our Executive officers have not been involved in any of the following events during the past ten years:\n1. bankruptcy petition filed by or against any business of which such person was a general partner or executive officer either at the time of the bankruptcy or within two years prior to that time;\n2. any conviction in a criminal proceeding or being subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses);\n3. being subject to any order, judgment, or decree, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, of any court of competent jurisdiction, permanently or temporarily enjoining, barring, suspending or otherwise limiting his/her involvement in any type of business, securities or banking activities; or\n4. being found by a court of competent jurisdiction (in a civil action), the Commission or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated a federal or state securities or commodities law, and the judgment has not been reversed, suspended, or vacated.\n5.

Such person was found by a court of competent jurisdiction in a civil action or by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to have violated any Federal commodities law, and the judgment in such civil action or finding by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has not been subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated;\n7. Such person was the subject of, or a party to, any Federal or State judicial or administrative order, judgment, decree, or finding, not subsequently reversed, suspended or vacated, relating to an alleged violation of:(i) Any Federal or State securities or commodities law or regulation; or(ii) Any law or regulation respecting financial institutions or insurance companies including, but not limited to, a temporary or permanent injunction, order of disgorgement or restitution, civil money penalty or temporary or permanent cease-and-desist order, or removal or prohibition order; or(iii) Any law or regulation prohibiting mail or wire fraud or fraud in connection with any business entity; or\n8.

The Board of Directors has evaluated the business of the Company and the number of employees and determined that since the business is operated by a small number of persons, general rules of fiduciary duty and federal and state criminal, business conduct and securities laws are adequate ethical guidelines. In the event our operations, employees and/or Directors expand in the future, we may take actions to adopt a formal Code of Ethics.\nShareholder Proposals\nOur Company does not have any defined policy or procedural requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for Directors. The Board of Directors believes that, given the stage of our development, a specific nominating policy would be premature and of little assistance until our business operations develop to a more advanced level. Our Company does not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to the Board of Directors and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. The Board of Directors will assess all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and make recommendations for election or appointment.\nA shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board of Directors may do so by directing a written request addressed to our President, at the address appearing on the first page of this Information Statement.

Under this rule, certain shares may be deemed to be beneficially owned by more than one person (if, for example, persons share the power to vote or the power to dispose of the shares). In addition, shares are deemed to be beneficially owned by a person if the person has the right to acquire shares (for example, upon exercise of an option or warrant) within 60 days of the date as of which the information is provided. In computing the percentage ownership of any person, the amount of shares is deemed to include the amount of shares beneficially owned by such person by reason of such acquisition rights. As a result, the percentage of outstanding shares of any person as shown in the following table does not necessarily reflect the persons actual voting power at any particular date.\n(1) Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and generally includes voting or investment power with respect to securities.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the each of two years in the year ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, for the financial year ended July 31, 2022, the Companys losses from operations, accumulated deficit, capital deficiency and negative operating cash flows raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to those charged with governance and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgements. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets\nThe Group has fully impaired its property, plant and equipment amounting to USD149,552 and its intangible assets amounting to USD25,392 as at July 31, 2022.\nThe Group carries out an impairment test by comparing the recoverable amount of cash generating unit (CGU) based on value in use method and the carrying amounts.\nThe impairment test was significant to our audit due to complexity of the assessment process involving significant judgements and estimation uncertainty in making key assumptions about future market and economic conditions growth rates, profit margins, discount rate, etc. for value in use of CGU based on the future discounted cash flows.\nOur procedures in relation to managements impairment assessments included, amongst others:\n(a) Examining managements cash flows forecast that support the impairment assessment;\n(b) Assessing the reliability of managements forecast through the review of past trends of actual financial performance against previous forecast results;\n(c) Evaluating the reasonableness and consistency of key assumptions and inputs used in cash flow projection to available external industry sources of data;\n(d) Performing sensitivity analysis to stress test the key assumptions and inputs used in the impairment assessment; and\n(e) Assessing the adequacy and reasonableness of the disclosures in the financial statements.\n/s/ JP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT\nJP CENTURION & PARTNERS PLT (ID: 6723)\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nOctober 31, 2022\nMU GLOBAL HOLDING LIMITED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF JULY 31, 2022 and 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\n(Audited)\nAs of July 31,\nASSETS\nNON-CURRENT ASSETS\nProperty, plant and equipment $ -

ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS BACKGROUND\nMU Global Holding Limited is organized as a Nevada limited liability company, incorporated on June 4, 2018. For purposes of consolidated financial statement presentation, MU Global Holding Limited and its subsidiary are herein referred to as the Company or we. The Company business of which planned principal operations are to provide wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon.\nOn June 29, 2018, the Company acquired 100% interest in MU Worldwide Group Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated in Seychelles and its subsidiary MU Global Holding Limited, a private limited liability company incorporated in Hong Kong. On August 16, 2018, MU Global Holding Limited incorporated a wholly-owned subsidiary in Shanghai, People Republic of China under the name of MU Global Health Management (Shanghai) Limited.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business.

MU Global Health Management (Shanghai) Limited Shanghai, August 16, 2018 RMB 7,400,300 Providing SPA and wellness service in China 100 %\nBusiness Overview\nMU Global is a beauty and wellness company, providing SPA and wellness service and also SPA related products to the customers. The services provided are designed to improve the overall health system and body function.\nSince the establishment, the Company has been focusing to expand in the Chinese market, with other country also under consideration as target destinations. As an emerging industry in China, the beauty and wellness industry are still in the early stage as there is a huge potential for the industry to growth significantly. According to a report published by the Chinese State Department, the beauty and wellness industry of the country is expected reach the market value of China 8 trillion Chinese Yuan by 2020, accounting for 6.5% of the country Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nIn year 2020, COVID-19 crisis has resulted the sales of the global beauty and wellness industry weak due to consumers have had limited access to retail outlets and supply chain bottlenecks have reduced product availability. In China, the industrys February sales fell up to 80 percent compared with 2019. Nevertheless, based on Mckinsey and Company research report on April 8, 2021, shows that consumers care deeply about wellness-and that their interest is growing and estimate the global wellness market at more than US$1.5 trillion, with annual growth of 5 to 10 percent. A rise in both consumer interest and purchasing power presents tremendous opportunities for companies, particularly as spending on personal wellness rebounds after stagnating or even declining during the COVID-19 crisis\nChina has large territory, population, diverse ethnicity and cultural background. As such, it has resulted in different consumer orientations in different cities and townships across the country, which is particularly challenging to tackle the consumer market with a single business model.\nThe advance in technological development and rise in use of technology in marketing has also intensified the competition, probing the Company to develop the business models that allow quick penetration and huge coverage of different markets, and also being able to cope with the swift changes in the consumer market. Thus, the Company is focusing on three key areas as part of the Companys early development in the Chinese market.\nThe first and most key focus is to enter the regional market through the adoption of franchisee and agent model, which the other parties are familiar and have deep understanding in the local market, hence its operating strategy is effective and best suited the targeted region.\nSecond, the key strategy is to ensure rapid development of the Omni channel marketing plan which targets to lease out at least ten thousand Stone Spa Bed (Hot Stone Bath equipment), reducing the time cost for the development of project, and most importantly, working on to spur sales and revenue growth.\nLastly, the essential requirement for business success in the Chinese market is to ensure and maintain a clear and transparent business model, which would result in effective collaboration between the company and its agent/franchisee, and consequently leads to efficient market operation and a win-win situation between the two parties.\nCurrently, the Company operates in the Chinese market with two business models:\n1. Tripartite co-operation and profit sharing model.\n2. Large-scale chain agent model\n3.\nDirect- service store model\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the application of certain significant accounting policies as described in this note and elsewhere in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes.\nBasis of presentation\nThese accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP).\nThe Company has adopted its fiscal year-end to be July 31.\nBasis of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of estimates\nManagement uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial statements in accordance with US GAAP. Those estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the balance sheets, and the reported revenue and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRevenue recognition\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASC 606. The standard is a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those goods or services.\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, net of discounts and taxes applicable to the revenue. The Company derives its revenue from provision of wellness and beauty services to customers via Company owned outlets, franchised outlets or distribution of our product to third party wellness and beauty salon.\nCost of revenue\nCost of revenue includes the cost of services and product incurred to provide wellness and beauty services and purchase of products.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Depreciation is calculated on the straight-line basis over the following expected useful lives from the date on which they become fully operational:\nSCHEDULE OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED LIFE\nClassification\nEstimated useful life\nLeasable equipment\nyears\nComputer hardware and software\nyears\nOffice equipment\nyears\nOutlet design fee and equipment\n3 years\nApplication development fee\n3 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The gain or loss on the disposal of property, plant and equipment is the difference between the net sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the relevant assets and is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nImpairment of long-live assets\nLong-lived assets primarily include trademark of the Company. In accordance with the provision of ASC Topic 360, Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, the Company generally conducts its annual impairment evaluation to its long-lived assets, usually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as significant sustained change in the business climate. The recoverability of long-lived assets is measured at the lowest level group. If the total of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying amount of the asset.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes lease payments for its short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease term in accordance with ASC 842.\nThe right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized on a straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term of the lease.\nIn determining the present value of the unpaid lease payments, ASC 842 requires a lessee to discount its unpaid lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, its incremental borrowing rate. As most of the Company leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for the lease. The Company incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments.\nInventories\nInventories consisting of products available for sell, are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of inventory is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventory reserve is recorded to write down the cost of inventory to the estimated market value due to slow-moving merchandise and damaged goods, which is dependent upon factors such as historical and forecasted consumer demand, and promotional environment. The Company takes ownership, risks and rewards of the products purchased. Write downs are recorded in cost of revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nThe Company conducts major businesses in China and is subject to tax in this jurisdiction. As a result of its business activities, the Company will file tax returns that are subject to examination by the foreign tax authority.\nGoing concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared using the going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company has generated revenue of $46,702 and continuously incurred a net loss of $357,333. As of July 31, 2022, the Company suffered an accumulated deficit of $2,389,181, capital deficiency of $533,364 and negative operating cash flows of $4,169. The Companys ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon improving the profitability and the continuing financial support from its shareholders and director. Management believes the existing shareholders, director or external financing will provide the additional cash to meet the Companys obligations as they become due.\nThese and other factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result in the Company not being able to continue as a going concern.\nMU GLOBAL HOLDING LIMITED\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\n(Currency expressed in United States Dollars (US$), except for number of shares)\nNet loss per share\nThe Company calculates net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260 Earnings Per Share. Basic loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per share is computed similar to basic loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common stock equivalents had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive.\nForeign currencies translation\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are translated into the functional currency using the applicable exchange rates at the balance sheet dates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive loss.\nThe functional currency of the parent Company is United States dollar and the functional currency of the subsidiaries MU Worldwide Group Limited (Seychelles) and MU Global Holding Limited (Hong Kong) is United States dollar.

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China (the COVID-19 outbreak) and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, it is uncertain as to the full magnitude that the pandemic will have on our financial condition, liquidity, and future results of operations. Management is actively monitoring the impact of the global situation on our financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. Given the daily evolution of the COVID-19 outbreak and the global responses to curb its spread, we are not able to estimate the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity for the year ended July 31, 2022.\nThe Management had considered the impact of COVID-19 outbreak in China, which would have affected the financial position, performance and cash flow of the Company for the financial year ended July 31, 2021. It was concluded that the impact of non-adjusting events arising from COVID-19 outbreak has not significantly affected the fair value of the financial assets or liabilities and non-financial assets of the Company, including the classification of non-current and current items that were presented on the reporting date.\n21.
