    "content": "Item 1. Business\nStar Alliance International Corp. (the Company, we, us) was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Our prior business plans, which generated limited or no earnings, included interior decorating products, and a travel and tourism service.\nOn May 14, 2018, Richard Carey our President and Chairman of the Board, acquired 22,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing 62.15% ownership of the Company which constitutes control. Mr. Carey accepted the positions of President and Chairman of the Board on the same day.\nIn August 14, 2018, the Company entered into an Exclusive Option Agreement (the Agreement) with Starving Lion, Inc. (Lion). Under the Agreement, the Company has been granted the exclusive option, for a period of six (6) months, to acquire the assets from Starving Lion, Inc. specified under the June 4, 2018 Letter of Intent. The assets pertain mainly to two mines located in Guatemala; one is a magnesium mine in El Progresso, and the other is a gold mine in Livingston.\nThe required purchase price for the Starving Lion, Inc. assets will be $1,000,000 cash, together with the issuance to Lion of new common and/or preferred stock to represent fifty-eight percent (58%) of the Companys issued and outstanding common stock on a fully-diluted, post-closing basis. The Company decided not to proceed with this potential acquisition at this time.\nOn October 25, 2018, Star entered into a Letter of Intent (the LOI) with Troy Mining Corporation, a Nevada corporation (Troy) and its two majority shareholders and on March 25, 2019 and on August 5th this LOI was extended. Troy is the owner of 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 4800 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal, California, in Mariposa County. Troy also owns a production processing mill together with related equipment and buildings. On August 13th, 2019, the Company closed the transaction making the first payment on the acquisition of all the assets of Troy Mining Corporation.\nOn June 12, 2019, the Board approved the issuance of 48 million shares of common stock to Richard Carey, reducing his loan by $48,000.\nOn July 2, 2020, the Board granted all 1,000,000 shares of the Series A preferred stock to the Companys Chairman and CEO, Richard Carey, in conversion of $68,556 of accrued compensation.\nThe Companys business focus will be the pursuit of mining, mining technology businesses and other business with significant patented technology.\nOn November 22, 2021, a binding Letter of Intent was signed for the acquisition of 49% of Genesis. Genesis is a patented technology for extracting gold from Oxide and other complex ore, in a sustainable method, that also yields a vastly improved recovery rate even where the presence of gold is as little as 0.25 parts per million. This is a clean, green and ecofriendly method with up to a 98% recovery rate. This project will be owned by a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of Star Alliance International Corp. Since the original letter of Intent was signed the terms have now been renegotiated and Stars new subsidiary will acquire 51% of Genesis. This is expected to close early in 2023.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company agreed to purchase 51% of Compania Minera Metalurgica Centro Americana (Commsa), a Honduran Corporation. Commsa owns the mining rights to five operating mines that run along a 12.5 mile stretch of the Rio Jalan River. This acquisition becomes effective in January 2022. The Company has issued to date 250,000 shares of Common stock and paid $75,000 towards the purchase price.\nOn May 9, 2022, a binding letter of intent was signed for the acquisition of 51% of NSM USA, a Wyoming corporation that owns 100% of four lithium mines in West Africa. The cost of these mines is $2 million most of which is to be used for the growth of the four mines. These mines that are already producing small amounts of Lithium will be greatly expanded with the purchase of equipment. This transaction is due to close early 2023 with full production expected in the second quarter of 2023.\nOn May 11, 2022, a binding letter of intent was signed for the acquisition of 51% of NGM USA, a Wyoming corporation that owns 100% of three gold mines in West Africa. The cost of this acquisition is $2 million, most of which will be used for equipment and growth of the mines. This transaction is due to close early 2023. All exploration work has been completed and production is anticipated to start in the second quarter of 2023.\nOn May 23, 2022, a binding letter of intent was signed for the acquisition of 75% of Magma International Inc. (MII). This acquisition for stock and cash will result in MII owning the Intellectual property, Building, equipment and significant inventory as well as the know how to produce Barotex. Mr. Lilo Benzicron the original inventor of this product will join Barotex as CEO and will be driving the innovation of new products for MII. This transaction is expected to close early 2023.\nEmployees\nThe management of the Company expects to use consultants, attorneys and accountants as necessary, and does not anticipate a need to engage any full-time employees so long as it is seeking and evaluating business opportunities. The need for employees and their availability will be addressed in connection with the decision whether or not to acquire or participate in specific business opportunities.\nSmaller Reporting Company Status\nWe qualify as a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, which is defined as a company with a public equity float of less than $75 million. To the extent that we remain a smaller reporting company at such time as are no longer an emerging growth company, we will still have reduced disclosure requirements for our public filings, some of which are similar to those of an emerging growth company, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nWe currently do not own or rent any property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nManagement is not aware of any legal proceedings contemplated by any governmental authority or any other party involving us or our properties. As of the date of this year-end report, no director, officer or affiliate is (i) a party adverse to us in any legal proceeding, or (ii) has an adverse interest to us in any legal proceedings. Management is not aware of any other legal proceedings pending or that have been threatened against us or our properties. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nThere is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a companys operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock.\nOTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.\nOur shares of our common stock have been trading on OTC Markets since 2020.\nNumber of Holders\nAs of June 30, 2022, the 162,788,028 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 159 shareholders of record.\nDividends\nNo cash dividends have been paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. We have not paid any cash dividends since our inception and do not foresee declaring any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company sold 21,955,000 shares of common stock for total cash proceeds of $564,000.\nDuring the fiscal year the Company has sold 2 tranches of Preferred C shares totaling 207,500 to an investor at $1.00 per share with total cash proceeds of $207,500.. These may be converted to common shares at the end of a six month hold period at a 35% discount to market.\nPurchase of our Equity Securities by Officers and Directors\nOn July 2, 2020, the Board granted all 1,000,000 shares of the Series A preferred stock to the Companys Chairman and CEO, Richard Carey, in conversion of $68,556 of accrued compensation.\nOther Stockholder Matters\nNone. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nOur cash balance was $71,724 as of June 30, 2022. We believe our cash balance is not sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations for any period of time. We have been utilizing funds raised from the sale of shares and borrowed from our Chairman. The Chairman has no commitment, arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to the company. The borrowing is non-interest-bearing, unsecured, and due on demand.\nOur independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company continues as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $15,058,400 and working capital of $1,034,930 as of June 30, 2022, and a net loss of $11,885,609 most of which is a non cash expense. The Company used $739,630 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to: not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements; exemptions from the requirements of holding an annual non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and nonbinding stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We are choosing to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that our decision to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nResults of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nOperating expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $1,909,581 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to $94,508 for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $1,815,073. The increase is due to an increase in filing fees and consulting expenses.\nProfessional fees were $144,763 for the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to $57,029 for the year ended June 30, 2021, increase of $87,734. Professional fees consist mainly of legal, accounting and audit expense. The increase is due to an increase in legal and audit fees.\nThere was a loss on conversion of common stock for Directors compensation of $2,111,500 and officer compensation of $952,500 for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to $90,000 and $155,000 for the year ended June 30, 2021\nOther income (expense)\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, we had interest expense of $297,417 and a net loss on conversion of debt of $102,403 compared to interest expense of $10,800 and loss on conversion of debt of $46,200 for the year ended June 30, 2021. In addition, there was a loss on issuance of convertible debt of $575,396 compared to $0 in 2021. . Interest expense has increased as a result of interest on notes payable that were added to the Companys liabilities and the amortization of debt discount associated with our convertible notes.\nNet Loss\nNet loss for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $11,885,609 compared to $503,017 for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nPlan of Operations\nWe expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through borrowing from related parties and others. Subsequent to the year end the Company acquired the mining claims and equipment assets of Troy Mining Corporation. We also acquired or entered into binding letters of intent to acquire other businesses during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nMaterial Commitments\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, we do not have any material commitments.\nPurchase of Significant Equipment\nWe do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has accumulated deficit of $15,058,400 and working capital of $1,034,930 as of June 30, 2022, and a net loss of $11,885,609 most of which is non cash expense. The Company used $739,630 of cash in operating activities for the year ended June 30, 2022. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $739,630 for the year ended June 30, 2022 as compared to the net cash used in operating activities of $355,574 for the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in net cash used in operating activities from 2022 to 2021 is because expenses increased during the year ended June 30, 2022.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $1,004,565 and $342,305 for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nOver the next twelve months, we expect our principle source of liquidity may be dependent on borrowings from related and other parties.\nGoing Concern Consideration\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion, meaning that there is substantial doubt if we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital. The Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations.\nLimited operating history and need for additional capital\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any significant revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firms\nBalance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Operations for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended June 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nStar Alliance International Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Star Alliance International Corp. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and the related statement of operations, stockholders deficit and cash flows for the period then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the period then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion\n.\nGoing Concern Uncertainty\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has incurred losses since inception of $15,058,400. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $11,885,609. These factors create an uncertainty as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nEmphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is not able to predict the ultimate impact that COVID -19 will have on its business. However, if the current economic conditions continue, the pandemic could have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many countries, including the geographical area in which the Company plans to operate.\nEmphasis of Matters-Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Company has had significant transactions and relationships with related parties, including the Companys Co-Chairman, which are described in the financial statements. Transactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arms length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free market dealings may not exist.\n/s/ Gries & Associates, LLC\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nDenver, Colorado\nNovember 22, 2022\nPCAOB# 6778\nSTAR ALLIANCE INTERNATIONAL CORP.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 71,724 $ 6,789\nPrepaids and other assets 547,350 -\nPrepaid stock for services 1,813,854 -\nTotal current assets 2,432,928 6,789\nProperty and equipment 450,000 450,000\nMining claims 57,532 57,532\nTotal other assets 507,532 507,532\nTotal Assets $ 2,940,460 $ 514,321\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 52,760 $ 18,378\nAccrued expenses 25,961 12,888\nAccrued compensation 212,428 171,370\nNotes payable 119,215 467,380\nConvertible notes payable, net of discount of $191,248 323,752 -\nDerivative liability 689,231 -\nNote payable -

NATURE OF BUSINESS\nStar Alliance International Corp. (the Company, we, us) was originally incorporated with the name Asteriko Corp. in the State of Nevada on April 17, 2014 under the laws of the state of Nevada, for the purpose of acquiring and developing gold mining as well as certain other mining properties worldwide.\nNOTE 2 - SIGNIFICANT AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND PRACTICES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents for the years ended June 30, 2022 or 2021.\nLong Lived Assets\nProperty consists of mining equipment not yet used. Our company assesses the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. When we determine that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment and the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from projected undiscounted cash flows, we record an impairment charge. Our company measures any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model. Significant management judgment is required in determining whether an indicator of impairment exists and in projecting cash flows.\nStock-based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure compensation cost for stock-based employee compensation at fair value at the grant date and recognize the expense over the employees requisite service period. The Company recognizes in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity-based compensation issued to employees and non-employees. The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the provision of ASC 505-50, Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of stock-based compensation is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest.\nNet income (loss) per common share\nNet loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants. The diluted loss per share is the same as the basic loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, as the inclusion of any potential shares would have had an antidilutive effect due to our loss from operations.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nThe carrying amount of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The Companys notes payable approximates the fair value of such instruments as the notes bear interest rates that are consistent with current market rates.\nThe following table classifies the Companys liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the fair value hierarchy as of June 30, 2022:\nSchedule Of Fair Value, Liabilities Measured on Recurring Basis\nDescription Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nDerivative $ - $ - $ 689,231\nTotal $ - $ - $ 689,231\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $15,058,400 as of June 30, 2022. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net loss of $11,885,609, which did include $11,104,275 of non-cash expense incurred for the issuance of common stock for services and derivatives associated with convertible debt. We used $739,630 of cash in operating activities. Due to these conditions, it raises substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its ability to raise additional funds. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 4 - ACQUISITION\nOn August 13, 2019, The Company closed an Asset Purchase Agreement (the APA) with Troy Mining Corporation (Troy). Under the APA, the company acquired 78 gold mining claims consisting of approximately 4,800 acres, located east/southeast of El Portal, California, in Mariposa County, together with all of Troys rights to related equipment and buildings currently located on the mining claims. In exchange for the mining claims and related assets, the company agreed to issue 1,883,000 shares of a new class of preferred stock designated Series B Preferred Stock; and agreed to make total cash payments in the amount of $500,000 under a Promissory Note (the Purchase Note).\nUnder the Purchase Note, we paid $50,000 at the time of the closing, and are required to pay an additional $50,000 within sixty days of the closing, and $25,000 every other month thereafter, with the entire remaining amount due no later than March 31, 2020.

Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has evaluated Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 regarding the impact of the decreased tax rates of the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment. The U.S. federal income tax rate of 21% is being used due to the new tax law recently enacted.\nNet deferred tax assets consist of the following components as of June 30:\nSchedule of deferred tax assets\nDeferred Tax Assets:\nNOL Carryover $ 830,300 $ 666,300\nLess valuation allowance (830,300 ) (666,300 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ - $ -\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $830,300 that may be offset against future taxable income. No tax benefit has been reported in the June 30, 2022 or 2021 financial statements; any tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act establishes new tax laws that affects 2018 and future years, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018.\nDue to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.\nASC Topic 740 provides guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements. Topic 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.\nThe Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the statements of operations in the provision for income taxes. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.\nWith few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2015.\nNOTE 12 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nManagement has evaluated subsequent events pursuant to the requirements of ASC Topic 855, from the balance sheet date through the date the financial statements were available to be issued, and has determined that no material subsequent events exist other than the following.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2022, the Company issued 20,050,000 shares of common stock for services.\nOn August 31, 2022, the Company sold 46,500 shares of Series C Preferred shares to Geneva Roth Remark Holdings Inc.\nOn November 17, 2022, the Chairman, Richard Carey agreed to give 4 million of his own shares of common stock in exchange for $42,000 which was loaned to the Company Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagements Conclusions Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as of June 30, 2022, the end of the year covered by this report, our management concluded its evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.\nDisclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nWith respect to the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon our evaluation regarding the fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Section 404). Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms. We note the following deficiencies that management believes to be material weaknesses:\n\u00b7 The Companys lack of segregation of duties.\n\u00b7 Lack of an audit committee and independent directors\n\u00b7 Management has not established appropriate and rigorous procedures for evaluating internal controls over financial reporting. Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control structure has not been accomplished.\n\u00b7 We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and note disclosures, however, these processes are not appropriately documented.\n\u00b7 Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures to ensure loss of data will not occur.\nThe Company is evaluating the necessity of implementing an independent board of directors to rectify these weaknesses.\nA material weakness (within the meaning of PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 5) is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the companys financial reporting.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended June 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
