    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nBellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) was formed in the State of Delaware on October 20, 2021 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post Holdings, Inc. (Post) for the purpose of effecting the separation of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) from Post. Under a transaction agreement and plan of merger (the Transaction Agreement) that we entered into on October 26, 2021 and amended as of February 28, 2022, with Post, Old BellRing and our subsidiary BellRing Merger Sub Corporation (Merger Sub), Post distributed approximately 80.1% of its interest in us to Posts shareholders and Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing, with Old BellRing surviving and becoming our subsidiary. On March 10, 2022, as a result of the completion of the transactions provided for under the Transaction Agreement (including the Separation and Distribution, each defined below), we became a new public holding company and the successor registrant to Old BellRing. In this report, we refer to the transactions undertaken pursuant to the Transaction Agreement as the Spin-off. The Spin-off is described in more detail below.\nOur Company\nWe are a leader in the global convenient nutrition category, aiming to enhance the lives of our consumers by providing them with nutritious, great-tasting products they can enjoy throughout the day. Our primary brands, Premier Protein and Dymatize, target a broad range of consumers and compete in all major product forms, including ready-to-drink (RTD) protein shakes, other RTD beverages and powders. Our products are distributed across a diverse network of channels including club, food, drug and mass (FDM), eCommerce, specialty and convenience.\nWe have organically grown our net sales from $988.3 million in our year ended September 30, 2020 to $1,371.5 million in our year ended September 30, 2022. Over the same period, net earnings including redeemable noncontrolling interest increased from $100.1 million in our year ended September 30, 2020 to $116.0 million in our year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe Spin-off\nPursuant to the Transaction Agreement and in connection with a series of corporate separation transactions, on March 9, 2022, Post contributed to us (i) all of its nonvoting common units of BellRing Brands, LLC (BellRing LLC) and its sole outstanding share of Old BellRings Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock and with Old BellRings Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock), collectively, the Old BellRing Common Stock)) and (ii) $550.4 million in cash, in exchange for Posts right to receive $840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 7.00% Senior Notes due 2030 and limited liability company interests in us (prior to our conversion to a Delaware corporation, as described below).\nOn March 10, 2022, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of our common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the BellRing Common Stock) to its shareholders in a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution). Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the record date for the Distribution. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders.\nAlso on March 10, 2022, upon completion of the Distribution, Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. Under the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock and $2.97 in cash, resulting in $115.5 million in total consideration paid to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger.\nAs a result of the Spin-off, we became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder.\nImmediately following the Spin-off, Post owned approximately 14.2% of BellRing Common Stock and the former holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock owned approximately 28.5% of BellRing Common Stock. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure of Old BellRing was eliminated. As of September 30, 2022, Post owned approximately 3.4% of BellRing Common Stock.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to BellRing, we, our, us, the Company and our Company refer to (1) Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the\ncompletion of the Spin-off, including BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (Premier Nutrition), Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (Dymatize), Supreme Protein, LLC (Supreme Protein), the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International GmbH (Active Nutrition International) and (2) us and our consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off, including, BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein and Active Nutrition International, in each case, unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates.\nOur History prior to the Spin-off\nPrior to completion of the Spin-off, and subsequent to Old BellRings initial public offering (the Old BellRing IPO), which was completed in October 2019, our subsidiary BellRing LLC was the holder of Posts active nutrition business, which had been comprised of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing. Old BellRing held the voting membership unit of BellRing LLC (which represented the power to appoint and remove the members of the board of managers of BellRing LLC and no economic interest). Post held one share of the Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67% of the voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing, with the holders of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock holding 33% of the voting power. Immediately prior to completion of the Spin-off, Post owned 71.5% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC, and Old BellRing (and, indirectly, the holders of the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock) owned 28.5% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC. Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC.\nPost had acquired the businesses that comprised its active nutrition business in a series of transactions during 2013, 2014 and 2015. In its fiscal year ended September 30, 2013, Post acquired Premier Nutrition, which, at the time, was a marketer and distributor of high-quality protein shakes and nutrition bars under the Premier Protein brand and nutritional supplements under the Joint Juice brand. Premier Nutrition, Inc. was founded in 1997, and Joint Juice, Inc. was founded in 1999. In 2011, Joint Juice, Inc. acquired the Premier Protein brand and related assets from Premier Nutrition, Inc., and the resulting entity assumed the name Premier Nutrition Corporation. Effective September 30, 2019, Premier Nutrition Corporation converted to a limited liability company and changed its corporate name to Premier Nutrition Company, LLC.\nIn its fiscal year ended September 30, 2014, Post acquired Dymatize, which, at the time, was a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality protein powders and nutritional supplements under the Dymatize brand and nutrition bars under the Supreme Protein brand. Dymatize was founded in 1994 and purchased the Supreme Protein brand in 2012.\nIn its fiscal year ended September 30, 2015, Post acquired the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International (then known as Powerbar Europe GmbH). The PowerBar brand was founded in 1986.\nOur Organizational Structure\nAs a result of the Spin-off:\nWe became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of our BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under 12(b) of the Exchange Act, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder.\nOld BellRing is our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nAs of September 30, 2022, all of our membership interests in BellRing LLC were contributed to Old BellRing such that Old BellRing is now the sole equity member of BellRing LLC.\nImmediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19,397,339 shares, or approximately 14.2%, of BellRing Common Stock. On August 11, 2022, Post disposed of 14,800,000 shares of BellRing Common Stock, which resulted in Post owning 4,597,339 shares, or approximately 3.4%, of BellRing Common Stock.\nSee Risk Factors included in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the information discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry and Operating Risks\nA substantial amount of our net sales comes from our RTD protein shakes, and a decrease in sales of our RTD protein shakes would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA substantial amount of our net sales is derived from our RTD protein shakes. Sales of our RTD protein shakes represented approximately 79.0% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2022. We believe that sales of our RTD protein shakes will continue to constitute a substantial amount of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be harmed by a decline in the market for our RTD protein shakes, increased competition in the market for those products, disruptions in our ability to produce those products, whether due to manufacturer inability, supply chain failures or otherwise (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), or our failure or inability to provide sufficient investment to support and market those products as needed to maintain or grow their competitive position or to achieve more widespread market acceptance.\nWe operate in a category with strong competition.\nThe convenient nutrition category in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other brands in the convenient nutrition category and with many nutritional food and beverage players, as well as manufacturers of private label and store brand products. Many of our competitors offer products similar to our products, or a wider range of products than we offer, and may offer their products at more competitive prices than we do. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Some of our principal competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than we have. Our category also includes a number of smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to retailers. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts, or a shift in consumer preferences to competitors products, could result in us reducing pricing, increasing marketing or other expenditures or losing market share. Competitive pressures also may restrict our ability to increase our prices, including in response to cost increases. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume. In addition, our competitors are increasingly using social media networks to advertise products. If we are unable to use social media effectively to advertise our products, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDisruption of our supply chain, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and changes in weather conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, third party contract manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, freight carrier availability, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, governmental restrictions or mandates, labor shortages, border closures, freight carrier availability, agricultural diseases, fires or evacuations related thereto, explosions, cyber incidents, terrorism, strikes or other labor unrest, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons could impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products.\nChanges in weather conditions and natural disasters, such as fires, floods, droughts, frosts, hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, insect infestations and plant disease, also may affect the cost and supply of commodities used as raw materials, including milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Further, as we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain ingredients and packaging materials, and one supplier for the majority of our milk-based protein, adverse events affecting such suppliers may limit our ability to obtain such raw materials, or alternatives for these raw materials, at competitive prices, or at all. For example, for our year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 64.7% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from our largest third party contract manufacturer, with approximately 38.9% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply manufactured at its Joplin, Missouri facility. In 2011, a major tornado struck Joplin, Missouri, but our supply of product from the Joplin, Missouri facility was not impacted. In addition, production of the RTD protein shakes in the 11 ounce size by our third party contract manufacturers requires packaging that we currently are sourcing from only one supplier, and equipment that our third party contract manufacturers are currently sourcing from the same supplier. Our supply of packaging for our 11 ounce RTD protein shakes from this supplier\ncomes primarily from three of its locations. Competitors can be affected differently by weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their suppliers and operations.\nDuring fiscal 2021 and 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted, and we expect it will continue to impact, our operations, including disruptions in our supply chain. During the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for certain of our products has in certain cases exceeded our production capacity and we expect will continue to do so in the future or otherwise strain our supply chain. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our supply chain and operations; however, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the severity and variants of the virus, the duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines and changes in consumer behaviors.\nWe are currently dependent on a limited number of third party contract manufacturers for the manufacturing of most of our products, including one manufacturer for the majority of our RTD protein shakes. Our business could suffer if we do not continue to contract with key third party manufacturers or as a result of a third party contract manufacturers inability to produce our products for us in the quantities required, on time or to our specifications.\nAll of our RTD protein shakes and most of our other products are manufactured by a limited number of independent third party contract manufacturers. For our year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 64.7% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply came from a single manufacturer and approximately 38.9% from a single facility of that manufacturer. Our agreement with this manufacturer is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2022; and while we are in the process of renegotiating our agreement with them, there is no assurance that we will be successful in reaching such an agreement at all or on terms, including costs and production capacity, that are favorable to us. Although we have added additional third party contract manufacturers of our Premier Protein RTD shakes to our third party contract manufacturing network, our number of third party contract manufacturers is still limited and if we do not successfully renegotiate our agreement with our largest contract manufacturer or if one or more of our third party contract manufacturers is unable to meet our supply requirements, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In fiscal 2019, a former third party contract manufacturer that we had expected to produce less than 10% of our RTD protein shakes for that year did not produce as we expected, which resulted in our termination of our agreement with it. Also, if we experience significant increases in demand for our products, as we did beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2021, which continued into fiscal 2022 and which we expect to continue into fiscal 2023, we and these third party contract manufacturers may not be able to obtain in a timely manner the equipment, ingredients or packaging materials required to manufacture our products and allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our quality standards. Further, as we have in fiscal 2022 and we expect to continue to in fiscal 2023, we may experience operational difficulties with any of these third party contract manufacturers, such as limitations on production capacity, failure to meet our quantity requirements, including as a result of pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, increases in manufacturing costs, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control and failure to meet production deadlines. We have had to, and expect into fiscal 2023 to have to, limit our stock-keeping units (SKUs) and place one or more of our products on allocation. In addition, we rely in part on our third party contract manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of our third party contract manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product withdrawal or recall, which could materially and adversely affect our reputation and subject us to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm. For example, in fiscal 2022, a third party manufacturer that we expected to produce less than 2% of our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes for fiscal 2022 initiated a recall of all products manufactured in one of its facilities, including our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes. The inability of third party contract manufacturers to ship orders in a timely manner, in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our business could be adversely affected if any of these third parties fail to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties cease doing business with us or go out of business.\nCertain of our relationships with these third parties are subject to minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to purchase, a minimum quantity of product, and we or the contract manufacturer may alternatively pay the other a mostly fixed amount rather than produce or purchase the minimum quantities. Despite the minimum volume commitments, we may nonetheless experience situations where such manufacturers are unable to fulfill their minimum volume obligations under our agreements or cannot produce sufficient amounts of product to meet consumer demand. For example, due to (i) better than expected volume growth for our Premier Protein RTD shakes and Dymatize powders in the second half of fiscal 2021, which continued into fiscal 2022 and, as to Premier Protein RTD shakes which we expect to continue into fiscal 2023, (ii) delays in production and planned incremental production capacity by our third party contract manufacturer network and (iii) in the case of Dymatize powders, whey protein availability, our customer demand exceeded our available capacity and resulted in Premier Protein RTD shakes and Dymatize powders inventories below acceptable levels at September 30, 2021 and Premier Protein RTD shakes inventories below\nacceptable levels at September 30, 2022. If we need to replace an existing third party contract manufacturer, our products may not be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all. Also, if demand for our products is significantly below our expectations, we may be obligated to pay penalties to our third party contract manufacturers for failing to purchase contracted minimum purchase quantities.\nOur reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain equipment, ingredients and packaging materials, the price and availability of ingredients and packaging materials, higher freight costs and higher energy costs could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe rely on a limited number of third party suppliers to provide certain equipment, ingredients and packaging materials used in our business. The primary ingredients used in our business include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends, and one supplier provides the majority of our milk-based protein. The supply and price of these ingredients are subject to market conditions and are influenced by many factors beyond our control, including labor shortages, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our milk-based protein costs have increased and may continue to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, animal feed costs, weather patterns affecting ingredient production, governmental programs and regulations, insects, plant diseases and inflation. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We utilize a sole supplier for the aseptic packaging for, and our third party contract manufacturers use equipment from the same sole supplier to manufacture, our Premier Protein RTD shakes in the 11 ounce size. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of such ingredients and packaging materials, increases in demand for such items, both within our industry and in general, can result in shortages and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules, we may lose a significant or sole supplier, a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications and we may not be able to purchase such items at a competitive cost. Further, the supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including labor shortages, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases weather conditions, natural disasters, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, inflation and increased demand. Our freight costs have increased and may continue to increase due to factors such as labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited carrier availability, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases and inflation. Higher prices for natural gas, propane, electricity and fuel also may increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. Historically, the prices of certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our business have fluctuated widely and this volatility has been heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have experienced and expect in the future to experience shortages of certain of our raw materials, which result in us paying increased costs for such inputs and impact our ability to produce our products.\nThe prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our input costs at the time they occur, or at all. Accordingly, changes in input costs may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nGlobal health developments and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted, are adversely impacting and could continue to adversely impact, our financial and operational performance.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been and are being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to directly and indirectly respond to and limit the spread, variants and resurgences of COVID-19 affected and could continue to affect our financial and operational performance, including:\nWe have experienced, and we expect that we will continue to experience, workforce or other disruptions in our supply chain, including our third party contract manufacturers, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including employee absenteeism and labor shortages, which have negatively impacted and we expect will continue to negatively impact our and our third party contract manufacturers ability to manufacture, and our ability to deliver, our products. We have had to, and expect into fiscal 2023 to have to, limit our SKUs and place one or more of our products on allocation.\nWe have experienced, and could continue to experience, shifts in consumption of our products due to reduced on-the-go usage occasions resulting from permanent and temporary business closures, shelter-in-place regulations or recommendations and changes in consumer behavior in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the operations of third parties in our supply chain has included, and we expect in the future will include, increases in the cost, or reductions in the availability and timely delivery of, ingredients, packaging and other materials used to manufacture our products, operational delays, increases in the cost of freight and lack of adequate manufacturing capacity and has resulted in, and we expect will result in additional, interruptions in our supply chain. In addition, failure of third parties on which we rely (raw materials suppliers, third party contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, external business partners and commercial banks) to meet their obligations to us or disruptions of their ability to do so could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating costs, including facility reconfiguration costs to enhance social distancing, purchases of equipment and supplies that are in high demand and costs to engage third party resources, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional expenses to comply with new requirements imposed by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nChanges and volatility in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products (such as occurred for certain of our products beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and continued into fiscal 2022), which in certain cases exceeded, and could in the future exceed, our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain and resulted in, and could in the future result in, limiting our SKUs and one or more of our products being placed on allocation.\nSignificant policy changes in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products (including quarantines, import or export restrictions, price controls, governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions or unemployment or other benefits) could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDeteriorating economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including economic slowdowns or recessions or significant disruptions or volatility in financial markets, could limit our ability to satisfy our debt obligations or impact the cost or availability of additional capital.\nActions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may result in investigations, legal claims or litigation against us.\nContinued business disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives and hinder our ability to achieve anticipated cost savings and productivity initiatives on planned timelines.\nChanges in trade promotion activities could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThese and other impacts have caused, and may continue to cause, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that have been and may continue to be material. Our efforts to manage and mitigate these factors may be unsuccessful, and the effectiveness of these efforts depends on factors beyond our control, including the duration and severity of an outbreak, as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate public health effects. In addition, such impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have heightened, or in some cases manifested, other risks disclosed in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. The COVID-19 pandemic continues, and we expect will continue, to impact our business. Additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of as of the date hereof. The extent and potential short and long term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which could be material, will depend on future developments, including the duration, severity and spread of COVID-19, actions that have and may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines, changing consumer behaviors and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets, all of which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our business depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors, and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of foods and beverages, consumer in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of certain foods and beverages, attention to sourcing practices relating to ingredients, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns regarding packaging and attention to other\nsocial and governance aspects of our Company and operations. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging. These changing preferences and requirements could require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that may be more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nConsumers are increasingly shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications and this trend is significantly altering the retail landscape in our category. If we are unable to effectively compete in the expanding eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, our business performance may be impacted, which may negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEmerging science and theories regarding health are constantly evolving, and products or methods of eating once considered healthy may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer be perceived as healthy. Approaches regarding healthy lifestyles also are the subject of numerous studies and publications, often with differing views and opinions, some of which may be adverse to us. In order to respond to new and evolving consumer and customer demands, achieve market acceptance and keep pace with new nutritional, technological and other developments, we must constantly introduce new and innovative products into the market. We may not be successful in developing, introducing on a timely basis or marketing any new or enhanced products, and specifically, the initial sales volumes for new or enhanced products may not reach anticipated levels, we may be required to engage in extensive marketing efforts to promote such products, the costs of developing and promoting such products may exceed our expectations and such products may not perform as expected. Further, certain ingredients used in our products may become negatively perceived by consumers, resulting in decreased demand for our products or reformulation of existing products to remove such ingredients, which may negatively affect taste or other qualities. Prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food and beverage products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs.\nAlthough we strive to respond to consumer or customer preferences and social expectations, we may not be successful in these efforts. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences or our inability to anticipate or react, or effectively introduce new products in response, to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur results may be adversely impacted if consumers do not maintain favorable perceptions of our brands.\nMaintaining and continually enhancing the value of our brands is critical to the success of our business. Brand value is based in large part on consumer perceptions. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including our products becoming unavailable to consumers, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, adverse publicity about our or our suppliers or third party contract manufacturers business practices, our products, packaging or ingredients, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products or consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support. We may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to maintain and increase customer and consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which could impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, an increase in our marketing and advertising efforts may not maintain our current reputation or lead to an increase in brand awareness. Negative perceptions of the food and beverage industry as a whole, or the convenient nutrition category, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, stockholders and other stakeholders to such factors and could adversely affect our brand image. The growing use of social and digital media by consumers, us and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative posts or comments about us, our brands, products or packaging or the food and beverage industry generally on social or digital media (whether factual or not) or security breaches related to use of our social media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our products and our brands, or if we experience a loss of consumer confidence in our brands, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nIn addition, our success in maintaining and enhancing our brand image depends on our ability to anticipate change and adapt to a rapidly changing marketing and media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online, digital and mobile dissemination of marketing and advertising campaigns and the increasing accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Furthermore, third parties may sell counterfeit or imitation versions of our products that are inferior or pose safety risks. If consumers confuse these counterfeit products for our products or have a bad experience with the counterfeit brand, they might refrain from purchasing our brands in the future, which could harm our brand image and sales. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our reputation and brand health, then our brands, product sales, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nConsolidation in our distribution channels, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our profit margins.\nOver the past several years, our channels have undergone significant consolidations and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers are gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they may seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on generic and other value brands and increased promotional programs. If we are unable to respond to these requirements, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired customer. Further, the economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like eCommerce, and our customers responses to those changes could impact our business. Consolidation in our channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers business operations or financial performance, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, would have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration and enter into new markets.\nSuccessful growth depends on our ability to add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio. This growth would include expanding the number of our products retailers offer for sale, our product placement and our ability to secure additional shelf or retail space for our products, as well as increased access to online platforms to sell our products. The expansion of our business depends on our ability to obtain new, or expand our business with existing, customers, such as club, FDM, eCommerce, convenience and specialty customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf our products become contaminated or adulterated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and we may experience product liability claims.\nSelling food products, beverages and nutritional supplements involves a number of legal and other risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the raw materials used to make certain of our products, particularly milk-based protein and nuts, are vulnerable to spoilage and contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella, and pests. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. We may need to recall or withdraw some or all of our products if they become damaged, contaminated, adulterated, mislabeled or misbranded, whether caused by us or someone in our manufacturing or supply chain. For example, in fiscal 2022, a third party manufacturer that we expected to produce less than 2% of our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes for fiscal 2022 initiated a recall of all products manufactured in one of its facilities, including our Premier Protein RTD protein shakes. A recall or withdrawal could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings for us or our third party contract manufacturers, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any product cause injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of a judgment against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place and may have rights to indemnification in certain situations, any of these events or a loss of consumer confidence could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLoss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nA limited number of customer accounts represents a large percentage of our combined net sales. Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart and its affiliates (which includes Sams Club), accounted for approximately 63.5% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2022.\nThe success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through the club, FDM, eCommerce, specialty and convenience channels. The competition to supply products to these high-volume stores is intense. Currently, we do not have material long-term supply agreements with our customers, and our customers frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our\nrevenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in our business due to changes in our promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe periodically offer a variety of sales and promotional incentives to our customers and consumers. Our net sales and profitability are impacted by the introduction and discontinuance of such sales and promotion incentives. In addition, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations due to the seasonal nature of our business. Seasonality could cause our results of operations for an interim financial period to fluctuate and not be indicative of our full year results. Seasonality also impacts relative revenue and profitability of each quarter of the year, both on a quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year basis. If we fail to effectively manage our inventories, fluctuations in business as a result of promotional activities and seasonality may have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include:\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\nunfavorable changes in tariffs, quotas, trade barriers or other export or import restrictions;\nunfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country;\nunfavorable foreign exchange controls and currency exchange rates;\nchallenges associated with cross-border product distribution;\nan outbreak of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, which may cause us or our distributors, third party contract manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity, acts of war and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.;\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations;\ncompliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the E.U.s General Data Protection Regulation), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such laws and regulations;\nunfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications;\nthe difficulty and costs of maintaining effective data security;\nthe potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;\nincreased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and\nthe difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across geographic regions.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value\nof foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the Canadian dollar and the Euro. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net foreign currency investment, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nOur market size and related estimates may prove to be inaccurate.\nData for the convenient nutrition category is collected for most, but not all, channels, and as a result, it is difficult to estimate the size of the market and predict the rate at which the market for our products will grow. We estimate the market size of the convenient nutrition category, including by geography, product form and consumer need state, based, in part, upon forecasts and information obtained from independent trade associations, industry publications and surveys and other independent sources, proprietary research studies and managements knowledge of the industry. While these estimates are made in good faith and are based on assumptions and estimates we believe to be reasonable, they may not be accurate.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them, or termination of our material intellectual property licenses, could reduce the value of our products and brands and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how and copyrights, to be a significant and valuable asset of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as third party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements and confidentiality provisions in third party agreements and the policing of third party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business. We also are subject to risks associated with protection of our trademarks and other intellectual property licensed to distributors of our products and of our trade secrets to our third party contract manufacturers. If our licensed distributors or third party contract manufacturers fail to protect our trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property, either intentionally or unintentionally, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe market certain of our products pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur growth has placed, and we expect that our continued growth may place, a significant demand on our management, personnel, systems and resources. Our continued growth will require an increased investment by us in our third party manufacturing relationships, personnel, technology, facilities and financial and management systems and controls, including monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations. We will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. Unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionate to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our operating margins and profitability will be adversely affected. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.\nTechnology failures, cybersecurity incidents and corruption of our data privacy protections could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities and to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third party contract manufacturers and suppliers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of such networks and systems increased while many of our employees were working remotely. Our and our third party manufacturing and distribution facilities and inventory management utilize information technology to increase efficiencies and control costs. Our and our third party vendors information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware or software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our business.\nIf we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain and protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our third party service providers fails to provide the services we require, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons).\nIf any of our significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber attacks, and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, litigation and reputational damage from leaks of confidential or personal information. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. Although we have not detected a material security breach or cybersecurity incident to date, we have been the target of events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Several states as well as foreign governments have laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.s retained version of General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation related to violations of such laws and regulations.\nClimate change, or legal or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business, reputation and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. If any of these climate changes has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters may result in damage and disruptions to our manufacturing operations and distribution channels or our third party contract manufacturers operations, particularly where a product is primarily sourced from a single location. Also, the impacts of these climate changes may cause unpredictable water availability or exacerbate water scarcity. Water is critical to our business, and the lack of available water of acceptable quality may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations. The increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water. If such laws are enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. Further, our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively address increased concerns from the media, stockholders and other stakeholders on climate change and related environmental sustainability and governance matters. In addition, any failure to achieve goals we may set with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment can lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we pursue acquisitions or other strategic transactions, we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate acquired businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may evaluate potential acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Evaluating potential transactions, including divestitures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support the acquired entities and information technology, personnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from day-to-day operating matters. Companies or operations we acquire or joint ventures we enter into may not be profitable or may not achieve the anticipated profitability that justify our investments.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, consummate a transaction on terms that are favorable to us or achieve expected returns and other benefits as a result of integration challenges. The successful integration of acquisitions is complex and depends on our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following: employees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate from employment with us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions; our management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses; we may encounter obstacles\nwhen incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management; we may be required to recognize impairment charges; and integration may be more costly or more time consuming and complex or less effective than anticipated. With respect to proposed divestitures of assets or businesses, we may encounter difficulty in finding acquirers or alternative exit strategies on terms that are favorable to us, which could delay the accomplishment of our strategic objectives, or our divestiture activities may require us to recognize impairment charges.\nOur corporate development activities may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Future acquisitions also could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and depreciation and amortization expenses related to certain tangible and intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFinancial and Economic Risks\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of September 30, 2022, we had $939.0 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility has a remaining borrowing capacity of $151.0 million as of September 30, 2022 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by ratings organizations were revised downward;\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy the terms of our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flow to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions; and\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity.\nDespite our level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt leverage, and we may in any event be required to maintain a minimum level of indebtedness.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness that may be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring certain obligations that may not constitute indebtedness under the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to refinance our existing indebtedness. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and additionally could require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or\nadditional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things: borrow money or guarantee debt; create liens; pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities; make investments and acquisitions; enter into, or permit to exist, contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; enter into new lines of business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements that may contain cross-default provisions. Our credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant that requires us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, as measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nTo service indebtedness and fund other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, our future financial and operating performance, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments, refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including: sales of assets; sale of equity; reductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances; or negotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in an amount sufficient, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nUncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, including during periods of high inflation, recessions or other economic disruption and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could limit consumer and customer demand for our products, increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect us.\nThe willingness of consumers to purchase our products depends in part on general or local economic conditions and consumers discretionary spending habits. For instance in fiscal 2022, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures which have continued into fiscal 2023. In periods of adverse or uncertain economic conditions, including during periods of high inflation or recession concerns and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, consumers may purchase less of our products, purchase more value or private label products or may forgo certain purchases altogether. In addition, our customers may seek to reduce their inventories in response to those economic conditions. In those circumstances, we could experience a reduction in sales. Further, during economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to, or continue to use, our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. Also, as a result of economic conditions, we may be unable to raise our prices sufficiently to protect profit margins. We experienced inflationary headwinds across our business during fiscal 2022, and we expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023. This trend could have a materially adverse impact in the future if inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or cost savings. Further, uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, has and could continue to negatively impact the financial stability of our customers or suppliers, which could lead to increased uncollectible receivables or non-performance. Current global geopolitical tensions, including related to Ukraine, may exacerbate any economic downturn and inflation. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the aggregate principal amount of our debt instruments with exposure to interest rate risk was $99.0 million. Higher interest rates will increase the cost of servicing our financial instruments with exposure to interest rate risk and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows.\nIn addition, the discontinuation, replacement or reform of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) could affect interest rates and financing costs. LIBOR is being discontinued and is scheduled to be fully phased-out by June 2023. Our credit agreement provides for relatively new benchmarks or references for determining interest rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA). It is unclear, however, if alternative rates or benchmarks, such as SOFR and SONIA, will be widely adopted, and this uncertainty may impact the liquidity of the SOFR and SONIA loan markets. The new rates may not be as favorable to us as those in effect prior to the discontinuation of LIBOR, and these new rates may be more volatile. Also, there may be uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates or as to the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts under the terms of an agreement or instrument that utilizes such rate or benchmark. In addition, the transition from LIBOR could have a significant impact on the overall interest rate environment and on our borrowing costs. While we do not expect the transition from LIBOR and the risks related thereto to have a material adverse effect on us, it remains uncertain at this time.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to stockholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also can be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues, including those that have arisen as a result of heightened inflation and recession or other economic concerns, could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers and customers.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing. In fiscal 2022, the U.S. experienced significantly heightened inflationary pressures and we expect that to continue into fiscal 2023. This and other events affecting the credit markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S., which may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or refinance our existing debt, sell our assets or borrow money, if necessary. Our business also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers or customers experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our ability to fund our operations or limit our ability to expand our business or increase our interest expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record additional impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill is expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and is not amortized. Our management reviews it for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the loss or bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. No impairments were recorded in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. However, we could have impairments in the future.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as freight, raw materials and energy, are outside of our control. Therefore, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. In addition, if the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred, and we will continue to incur, additional fees, costs and expenses to create and maintain the corporate infrastructure to operate as a public company, and we have and we will continue to experience increased ongoing costs and expenses in connection with being a public company.\nPrior to our IPO, our business had historically used some of Posts corporate infrastructure and services to support our business functions. The expenses related to establishing and maintaining this infrastructure had been spread across all of Posts businesses and charged to us on a cost-allocation basis. The services historically provided to us by Post included, but were not limited to, finance, information technology, legal, human resources, quality, supply chain and purchasing functions. Following our IPO, we continued to receive some of these services pursuant to a master services agreement with Post, and in connection with the Spin-off, we, Post, Old BellRing and BellRing LLC entered into an amended and restated master services agreement. Under the amended and restated master services agreement, Post continues to provide some or all of the above described services, and, in general, the services to be provided by Post will continue for the periods specified in the amended and restated master services agreement, but not to exceed three years, subject to any subsequent extension or earlier termination as agreed to by the parties. There can be no assurance that all of the functions provided to us by Post under the amended and restated master services agreement will be successfully executed by Post or that we will not have to expend significant efforts or costs materially in excess of those estimated in the master services agreement. Any interruption in these services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, upon termination of the amended and restated master services agreement, we will need to perform these functions ourselves or hire third parties to perform these functions on our behalf.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and our forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and the factors described under Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance and, accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included in this document relates to the Company's historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Post\nPosts interests may conflict with our interests and the interests of our other stockholders. Conflicts of interest or disputes between Post and our Company could be resolved in a manner unfavorable to our Company and our other stockholders.\nPost could have interests that differ from, or conflict with, the interests of our other stockholders. Potential conflicts of interest or disputes may arise between Post and us in a number of areas relating to our past or ongoing relationships, including:\nthe Transaction Agreement and the Distribution;\ntax, employee benefits, indemnification and other matters;\nthe Spin-off;\nthe nature, quality and pricing of services Post has agreed to provide to us;\nbusiness opportunities that may be attractive to both Post and us; and\nany new commercial arrangements between Post and us in the future.\nThe resolution of any potential conflicts or disputes between Post and us may be less favorable to us than the resolution we might achieve if we were dealing with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur Company has overlapping directors and management with Post, which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests.\nCertain of our officers and directors, including Robert V. Vitale, who serves as Executive Chairman of our Board of Directors, also serve as officers or directors of Post. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our stockholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at Post have fiduciary duties to Posts shareholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and Post. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in Post. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Post. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors.\nOur certificate of incorporation could prevent us from benefiting from corporate opportunities that might otherwise have been available to us.\nOur certificate of incorporation includes certain provisions regulating and defining the conduct of our affairs to the extent that they may involve Post and its directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates and our rights, powers, duties and liabilities and those of our directors, officers, managers, employees and agents in connection with our relationship with Post. In general, and except as may be set forth in any agreement between us and Post, these provisions provide that Post and its affiliates may carry on and conduct any business of any kind, nature or description, whether or not such business is competitive with or in the same or similar lines of business as us; Post and its affiliates may do business with any of our customers, vendors and lessors; and Post and its affiliates may make investments in any kind of property in which we may make investments. In addition, these provisions provide that we renounce any interest or expectancy to participate in any business of Post or its affiliates.\nMoreover, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interests or expectancy in corporate opportunities which become known to (i) any of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates (except that we and our subsidiaries are not deemed affiliates of Post or its affiliates for the purposes of the provision) or (ii) Post or its affiliates. Generally, neither Post nor our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also are directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post or its affiliates will be liable to us or our stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that any such person pursues or acquires any corporate opportunity for the account of Post or its affiliates, directs, recommends or transfers such corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates or does not offer or communicate information regarding such corporate opportunity to us because such person has directed or intends to direct such opportunity to Post or one of its affiliates. This renunciation does not extend to corporate opportunities expressly offered to one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents, solely in his or her capacity as a director, officer, manager, employee or agent of us.\nThese provisions in our certificate of incorporation will cease to apply at such time as (i) we and Post and its affiliates are no longer affiliates of one another and (ii) none of the directors, officers, employees, agents or affiliates of Post serve as our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents. The corporate opportunity provision may exacerbate conflicts of interest between Post and us because the provision effectively permits one of our directors, officers, managers, employees or agents who also serves as a director, officer, employee, agent or affiliate of Post or its affiliates to choose to direct a corporate opportunity to Post or its affiliates instead of to us.\nWe may be unable to take certain actions because such actions could jeopardize the tax-free status of the Spin-off, and such restrictions could be significant.\nTo preserve the tax-free treatment of the Spin-off, for the initial two-year period following the Spin-off, we are prohibited, except in limited circumstances, from taking or failing to take certain actions that would prevent the Spin-off and related transactions from being tax-free, including: (i) issuing any equity securities or securities that could possibly be converted into our equity securities, including as acquisition currency for a merger or acquisition (but excluding certain equity compensation for employees); (ii) redeeming or repurchasing our equity securities or our debt or (iii) entering into any transaction pursuant to which our stock would be acquired, whether by merger or otherwise. These restrictions will not apply if we deliver an unqualified will-level tax opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm (BellRing Tax Counsel) or a ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) that the action will not cause such Spin-off to fail to qualify for its intended tax treatment.\nWe may be responsible for U.S. federal income tax liabilities that relate to the Spin-off.\nThe completion of the Spin-off by Post was conditioned on the receipt by Post of an opinion of a nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm (the distribution tax counsel and, together with BellRing tax counsel, tax counsel) to the effect that the Separation, together with certain contributions made by Post to us, should qualify as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a) and 355 of the Code and the Distribution should qualify as a tax-free distribution eligible for nonrecognition within the meaning of Sections 355 and 361 of the Code. The completion of the Spin-off was also conditioned on the receipt by us of an opinion of BellRing tax counsel to the effect that the merger of Merger Sub with and into Old BellRing qualified as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or, alternatively, as a transaction qualifying for nonrecognition of gain and loss under Section 351 of the Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the IRS. Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the distribution that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinions. The opinions will be based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsels conclusions. We are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or the opinion of tax counsel to be incomplete or untrue.\nIf all or a portion of the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction for any reason, including because any of the factual statements or representations in the legal opinions are incomplete or untrue, Post may recognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nEven if the Distribution otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distribution will be taxable to Post (but not to Post shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) if there are (or have been) one or more acquisitions (including issuances), directly or indirectly (including through acquisitions of such stock after the completion of the Transactions), of our stock or the stock of Post, representing 50 percent or more, measured by vote or value, of the stock of any such corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. The process for determining whether an acquisition is part of a plan under these rules is complex, inherently factual in nature, and subject to a comprehensive analysis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case. In general, any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the Distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5 percent stockholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability would be substantial.\nWe have agreed not to enter into certain transactions that could cause any portion of the Distribution to be taxable to Post, including under Section 355(e) of the Code. Pursuant to a tax matters agreement with Post, we have also agreed to indemnify Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions or other actions we take, and Post has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Post. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nIn addition, pursuant to the tax matters agreement, if and to the extent the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries, and we are not required to indemnify Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction, then Post will be entitled to periodic payments from us equal to 85% of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries resulting from such failure and Post and we will negotiate in good faith the terms of a tax receivable agreement to govern the calculation of such payments applying the principles of, and adhering as closely as practicable to, the existing tax receivable agreement between Post and BellRing. Payments under such tax receivable agreement may be substantial, and in certain cases may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nOur agreements with Post require us to indemnify Post for certain tax liabilities.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and Distribution, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Post (the Tax Matters Agreement), we have agreed to indemnify Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions or other actions we take, and Post has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from transactions entered into by Post. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nIn addition, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, if and to the extent the distribution does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries, and we are not required to indemnify Post for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as a tax-free transaction, then Post will be entitled to periodic payments from us equal to 85% of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of assets held by us and our subsidiaries resulting from such failure and Post and we will negotiate in good faith the terms of a tax receivable agreement to govern the calculation of such payments applying the principles of, and adhering as closely as practicable to, the existing tax receivable agreement between Post and BellRing. Payments under such tax receivable agreement may be substantial, and in certain cases may be accelerated or significantly exceed the actual benefits we realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nViolations of laws or regulations by us or our third party contract manufacturers, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., as well as government authorities outside of the U.S., including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling, distribution and worker health and workplace safety. Our activities, both inside and outside of the U.S., are subject to extensive regulation. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Proposition 65. In Europe, we are regulated by, among other authorities, the U.K.s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed.\nGovernmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy usage, data privacy and immigration and labor issues, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our business or the businesses of our customers, suppliers or third party contract manufacturers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, travel restrictions, product and equipment seizures, import and export restrictions, price controls, governmental and regulatory actions, mandatory business closures and other restrictions that have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our operations.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in, or changes in interpretations of, these laws or regulations or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers or suppliers or third party contract manufacturers, causing our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. Further, if we are found to be out of compliance with applicable laws and regulations in these areas, we could be subject to civil remedies, including fines, revocations of required licenses, detention, seizure, injunctions or recalls, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIt also is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties, revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter and/or institute enforcement actions that could result in additional costs, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market, and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any product liability claims resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nWe also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we or our third party contract manufacturers manufacture, sell or distribute our products. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in quarantines, import and export restrictions, price controls, governmental and regulatory actions, mandatory business closures and other restrictions that could adversely impact our operations.\nCertain of our products are subject to a higher level of regulatory scrutiny, resulting in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales.\nCertain of our products are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements, which are subject to FDA regulations and levels of regulatory scrutiny different from those applicable to conventional food. Internationally, the convenient nutrition category is regulated as food and dietary supplements. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nPending and future litigation and claims may impair our reputation or lead us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, third party contract manufacturers, intellectual property infringement, product recalls, product liability, false or deceptive advertising, employment matters, environmental matters or other aspects of our business. There has been a recent increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. In addition, actions we have taken or may take, or decisions we have made or may make, may result in legal claims or litigation against us. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, be required to modify our business processes, practices or products or be required to stop selling certain of our products. For instance, one of our operating subsidiaries, Premier Nutrition, LLC, is a defendant in several class action lawsuits related to it Joint Juice product. At September 30, 2022, we had accrued $16.0 million related to these matters. In addition, intellectual property infringement litigation or claims could cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property. Any or all of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of litigation is often difficult to predict, and the outcome of pending or future litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with lawsuits and claims could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners and operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate the emission of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide and methane.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring responsive action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risk factors listed in this report or for reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, our failure to meet analysts earnings estimates, investor perceptions, or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or\nsuppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies.\nWe may not declare or pay any dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operations, expansion and debt repayment. We have not paid cash dividends to date and have no current plans to pay any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, our stockholders must rely on sales of their shares of our common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Any future determination to pay dividends, including timing and amount, will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and subject to, among other things, our compliance with applicable law, and depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, level of indebtedness, capital requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions in our debt agreements, business prospects and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Our ability to pay dividends depends on our receipt of cash dividends from our operating subsidiaries and our ability to pay dividends may be further restricted as a result of the laws of our subsidiaries jurisdictions of organization or their agreements, including agreements governing indebtedness.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Delaware law may discourage or prevent strategic transactions, including a takeover of the Company, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL) could delay or prevent a third party from entering into a strategic transaction with us, as applicable, even if such transaction would benefit our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation and bylaws:\ndivide the members of the Board of Directors into three classes with staggered three-year terms, which may delay or prevent a change of our management or a change on control;\nauthorize the issuance of blank-check preferred stock that could be issued by us upon approval of the Board of Directors to increase the number of outstanding shares of capital stock, making a takeover more difficult and expensive;\nprovide that directors may be removed from office only for cause and that any vacancy or newly created directorships on the Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of directors then in office, which may make it difficult for other stockholders to reconstitute the Board of Directors;\nprovide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only upon the request of a majority of the Board of Directors or by the chairman of the Board of Directors or the chief executive officer;\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent and require that any action to be taken by stockholders be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders; and\nrequire advance notice to be given by stockholders for any stockholder proposals or director nominees.\nThese restrictions and provisions could keep us from pursuing relationships with strategic partners and from raising additional capital, which could impede our ability to expand our business and strengthen our competitive position. These restrictions could also limit stockholder value by impeding a sale of the Company.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the Court of Chancery) (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the federal district court for the State of Delaware) is the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law:\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\nany action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the DGCL; and\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine.\nThis provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act, for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. However, our certificate of incorporation also provides that U.S. federal courts will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action or proceeding arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than that designated in the Companys exclusive forum provision. Although\nour certificate of incorporation contains the exclusive forum provision described above, it is possible that a court could find that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable. The exclusive forum provision shall not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with the Company or its directors, officers, or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risks\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the IRS or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in our stock. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the IRS or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, temporary workforce disruptions or the inability of our employees to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key personnel, including our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse personnel to operate and expand our business. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel. If we lose key personnel, or one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop a sufficient number of qualified and diverse employees to operate and expand our business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed.\nOur business is dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs. If we experience workforce disruptions or periods where our employees are unable to safely perform their jobs for any reason, including as a result of illness (such as COVID-19) or restrictions put in place by governmental authorities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in labor-related costs, including costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability.\nInflationary pressures and shortages in the labor market have increased, and could continue to increase, our labor costs, which could negatively impact our profitability. With approximately 380 employees as of November 1, 2022, our profitability may be substantially affected by costs of medical and other health and welfare benefits for these employees. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in healthcare laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase could negatively affect our profitability. In addition, we continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor-related costs. Any substantial increase in these costs could have a materially negative impact on our profitability.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and the price of our common stock could suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to do a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may\nnot be remedied in time to meet the deadlines imposed by SOX and SEC rules. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken and the price of our common stock may suffer. In addition, in the event we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As of September 30, 2022, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nActions of stockholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe may, from time to time, be subject to proposals and other requests from stockholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effect a change in our management. In the event of such stockholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our business could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, business partners and customers. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nPost provides us space for our principal executive offices in St. Louis, Missouri pursuant to the MSA among BellRing Inc., BellRing LLC, BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. and Post. Our other administrative offices, as well as the warehousing, distribution and research and development facilities of our principal operations, are described below. While our products are primarily manufactured by third party contract manufacturers, we also own one manufacturing facility. For additional information regarding our third party manufacturing network, see Business - Supply Chain in Item 1 of this report.\nWe lease a research and development facility and administrative office in Emeryville, California. We also lease administrative offices in Dallas, Texas; Rogers, Arkansas; Munich, Germany and Worb, Switzerland. Through third party logistics firms, we lease warehouse space in Tagelswangen, Switzerland and a distribution center with warehouse space in Kleve, Germany. We also manufacture protein and energy bars and gels and conduct research and development through an owned facility in Voerde, Germany. Management believes our facilities generally are in good operating condition. In conjunction with our arrangements with third party contract manufacturers and our planned expansion of the same in response to demand for certain of our products exceeding our production capacity in both fiscal 2022 and 2021, management believes, taken as a whole, our facilities generally are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. See Risk Factors included in Item 1A of this report for more information about our supply chain. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nThe information required under this Item 3 is set forth in Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report and is incorporated herein by this reference. For disclosure of environmental proceedings with a governmental entity as a party pursuant to Item 103(c)(3)(iii) of Regulation S-K, the Company has elected to disclose matters where the Company reasonably believes such proceeding would result in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, of $1.0 million or more. Applying this threshold, there are no such environmental proceedings pending as of the filing date of this report or that were resolved during the three months ended September 30, 2022. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) and its consolidated subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under Item 8 of this report and the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1.\nOVERVIEW\nOn October 21, 2019, BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) closed its initial public offering (the IPO) of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock) and contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of Old BellRing (BellRing LLC), in exchange for 39.4 million BellRing LLC non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units). As a result of the IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the IPO (the formation transactions), BellRing LLC became the holding company for the active nutrition business of Post Holdings, Inc. (Post). Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC and had no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Post completed its previously announced distribution of 80.1% of its ownership interest in BellRing to Posts shareholders. On March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Transaction Agreement), by and among Post, Old BellRing, BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (Old BellRing Class B Common Stock), all of its BellRing LLC units and $550.4 million of cash to BellRing (collectively, the Contribution) in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing (prior to the conversion of BellRing into a Delaware corporation) and the right to receive $840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the 7.00% Senior Notes).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock) to Post shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution). Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders.\nUpon completion of the Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock plus $2.97 in cash, or $115.5 million total consideration paid to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger. As a result of the transactions described above (collectively, the Spin-off), BellRing became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder.\nImmediately prior to the Spin-off, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units, equal to 71.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and one share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67% of the combined voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing.\nImmediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19.4 million shares, or 14.2%, of the BellRing Common Stock and Post shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining their effective ownership in the Old BellRing business prior to the Spin-off. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated, and Posts remaining ownership did not represent a controlling interest in BellRing.\nOn August 11, 2022, Post transferred 14.8 million of its remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post, which reduced Posts ownership of BellRing Common Stock to 3.4% as of September 30, 2022. In connection with this transaction, BellRing repurchased 0.8 million of the transferred shares from certain of the financial institutions.\nBellRing incurred separation-related expenses of $14.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, in connection with the Spin-off. These expenses generally included third party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to BellRing, we, our, us, the Company and our Company refer to Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the Spin-off and us and our consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. The term Common Stock generally refers to Old BellRing Class A Common Stock and Old BellRing Class B Common Stock during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to BellRing Common Stock during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. The term Net earnings available to Common Stockholders generally refers to net earnings available to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to net earnings available to BellRing common stockholders during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off.\nWe are a consumer products holding company operating in the global convenient nutrition category and are a provider of ready-to-drink (RTD) protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders and nutrition bars. We have a single operating and reportable segment, with our principal products being protein-based consumer goods. Our primary brands are Premier Protein and Dymatize.\nIndustry & Company Trends\nThe success of companies in the convenient nutrition category is driven by how well such companies can grow, develop and differentiate their brands. We expect the convergence of several factors to support the continued growth of the convenient nutrition category, including:\nconsumers increasingly dedicated pursuit of active lifestyles and growing interest in nutrition and wellness;\ngrowing awareness of the numerous health benefits of protein, including sustained energy, muscle recovery and satiety; and\na rise in snacking and the desire for products that can be consumed on-the-go as nutritious snacks or meal replacements.\nNonetheless, the consumer food and beverage industry faces a number of challenges and uncertainties, including:\nthe highly competitive nature of the industry, which involves competition from a host of nutritional food and beverage companies, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products as well as manufacturers of private label and store brand products;\nchanging consumer preferences which require food manufacturers to identify changing preferences and to offer products that appeal to consumers;\nsupply chain challenges, including labor shortages and equipment delays, which have delayed capacity expansion across the broader third party aseptic processing contract manufacturer network and are expected to continue into fiscal 2023; and\nincreasing inflationary pressures, which are expected to continue into fiscal 2023, on the costs of ingredients and packaging materials and transportation.\nSeasonality\nWe have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal fluctuations in our sales and operating profit margins because of customer spending patterns and timing of our key retailers promotional activity. Historically, our first fiscal quarter is seasonally low for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season. Sales are typically higher throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of promotional activity at key retailers as well as organic growth of the business.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause global economic disruption and uncertainty, including in our business. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and remain focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees and serving customers and consumers. Our primary categories returned to growth rates in line with their pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and have remained strong in subsequent periods.\nAs the overall economy continues to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, input and freight inflation and input and labor availability are pressuring our supply chain. Lower than anticipated production and delays in capacity expansion across the broader third party contract manufacturer network have resulted in low shake inventory volumes and missed sales.\nService levels and fill rates remain below normal levels, and certain products have been placed on allocation. These factors are expected to improve but persist throughout fiscal 2023 and are dependent upon our contract manufacturer partners ability to deliver committed volumes, add capacity on expected timelines, retain manufacturing staff and rebuild inventory levels. Raw material, packaging and freight inflation has been widespread, rapid and significant, and has put downward pressure on profit margins. As a result, we have taken pricing actions on nearly all products. For additional discussion, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section, as well as Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statementson page 1 of this report and Risk Factors in Part I of this report.\nItems Affecting Comparability\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, net sales and/or operating profit were impacted by the following items:\naccelerated amortization expense of $29.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 related to the discontinuance of the Supreme Protein brand;\nrestructuring and facility closure costs, including accelerated depreciation, of $0.3 million and $5.6 million related to the closing of our Dallas, Texas office and the downsizing of our Munich, Germany location during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively;\nseparation-related expenses of $14.5 million, $0.2 million and $1.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with our separation from Post; and\n$8.0 million of expense for the year ended September 30, 2022 related to provisions for legal matters. For additional information, refer to Note 15 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nFor further discussion, refer to Results of Operations within this section.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021 Fiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nfavorable/(unfavorable) favorable/(unfavorable)\ndollars in millions 2022 2021 $ Change % Change 2021 2020 $ Change % Change\nNet Sales\n$ 1,371.5 $ 1,247.1 $ 124.4 10 % $ 1,247.1 $ 988.3 $ 258.8 26 %\nOperating Profit\n$ 212.4 $ 168.0 $ 44.4 26 % $ 168.0 $ 164.0 $ 4.0 2 %\nInterest expense, net\n49.2 43.2 (6.0) (14) % 43.2 54.7 11.5 21 %\nLoss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net 17.6 1.6 (16.0) (1,000) % 1.6 - (1.6) (100) %\nIncome tax expense 29.6 8.8 (20.8) (236) % 8.8 9.2 0.4 4 %\nLess: Net earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 33.7 86.8 53.1 61 % 86.8 76.6 (10.2) (13) %\nNet Earnings Available to Common Stockholders $ 82.3 $ 27.6 $ 54.7 198 % $ 27.6 $ 23.5 $ 4.1 17 %\nNet Sales\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nNet sales increased $124.4 million, or 10%, during the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. Sales of Premier Protein products were up $75.2 million, or 7%, driven by higher average net selling prices. Average net selling prices increased in the year ended September 30, 2022 due to targeted price increases and decreased promotional spending. These positive impacts were partially offset by volume decreases of 8%, which were primarily the result of supply constraints and reduced demand-driving activity. Sales of Dymatize products were up $54.3 million, or 35%, driven by higher average net selling prices. Average net selling prices increased in the year ended September 30, 2022 due to targeted price increases and decreased promotional spending. These positive impacts were partially offset by volume decreases of 5%, which were driven by elasticities due to inflation-driven price increases and product discontinuations. Sales of all other products were down $5.1 million.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nNet sales increased $258.8 million, or 26%, during the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. Sales of Premier Protein products were up $207.8 million, or 25%, with volume up 24%. Volume increases were driven by higher RTD protein shake product volumes which primarily related to distribution gains for both existing and new products and strong velocities driven by promotional activity and category momentum. Sales of Dymatize products were up $47.4 million, or 43%, with volume up 29%. Volume increases were primarily driven by distribution gains for both existing and new products and strong velocities driven by category momentum and lower international and specialty channel volumes in the prior year, largely resulting from consumer reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic. Average net selling prices increased during the year ended September 30, 2021 due to a favorable product mix. Sales of all other products were up $3.6 million.\nOperating Profit\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nOperating profit increased $44.4 million, or 26%, during the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales, due to higher average selling prices as previously discussed, reduced advertising costs of $16.5 million and lower restructuring and facility closure costs. In addition, prior year operating profit was negatively impacted by $29.9 million of accelerated amortization related to the discontinuance of the Supreme Protein brand. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher net product costs of $140.5 million due to unfavorable raw material, freight and manufacturing costs, higher costs related to the separation from Post of $14.3 million and higher expenses for legal matters of $8.0 million.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nOperating profit increased $4.0 million, or 2%, during the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales, as previously discussed, and lower costs related to the separation from Post of $1.7 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher net product costs of $38.9 million due to unfavorable raw material, freight and manufacturing costs, accelerated amortization expense of $29.9 million related to the discontinuance of the Supreme Protein brand, restructuring and facility closure costs, including accelerated depreciation of $5.6 million, increased advertising costs of $6.1 million and higher employee-related costs.\nInterest Expense, Net\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nInterest expense, net increased $6.0 million during the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to higher outstanding principal amounts of debt and a higher weighted-average interest rate compared to the prior year, partially offset by increased net hedging gains (compared to losses in the prior year period) of $3.8 million recognized on interest rate swaps. The weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt increased to 6.2% for the year ended September 30, 2022 from 5.3% for the year ended September 30, 2021, driven by the issuance of our 7.00% Senior Notes during the second quarter of fiscal 2022.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nInterest expense, net decreased $11.5 million during the year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to lower principal amounts of debt outstanding. In addition, the weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt decreased to 5.3% for the year ended September 30, 2021 from 6.3% for the year ended September 30, 2020, driven by lower variable interest rates and the refinancing of our Term B Facility (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources) during the second quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSee Notes 14 and 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt and interest rate swaps, respectively.\nLoss on Extinguishment and Refinancing of Debt, Net\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recognized a $17.6 million loss related to the termination of our Old Credit Agreement (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources). This loss included (i) a $6.9 million write-off of unamortized discounts and debt extinguishment fees, (ii) a $6.1 million write-off of unamortized net hedging losses recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income or loss related to the Term B Facility and (iii) a $4.6 million write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred financing fees.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we recognized $1.6 million of losses related to refinancing fees incurred in conjunction with the refinancing of our Term B Facility.\nSee Note 14 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 20.3% compared to 7.1% for fiscal 2021 and 8.4% for fiscal 2020. The following table presents the reconciliation of income tax expense with amounts computed at the federal statutory tax rate.\nYear Ended September 30,\ndollars in millions 2022 2021 2020\nComputed tax (21%) $ 30.6 $ 25.9 $ 23.0\nIncome tax expense attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest (7.6) (19.5) (16.2)\nState income taxes, net of effect on federal tax 4.7 4.0 3.0\nTransaction costs 2.0 - (1.2)\nUncertain tax position - - 1.5\nOther, net (none in excess of 5% of computed tax) (0.1) (1.6) (0.9)\nIncome tax expense $ 29.6 $ 8.8 $ 9.2\nThe increase in our effective income tax rate for fiscal 2022 compared to each of the prior years was primarily due to the change in tax expense allocation related to the Spin-off. After the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes, whereas in fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company reported 28.8% of such activity.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOn March 10, 2022, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we issued the 7.00% Senior Notes to Post as partial non-cash consideration for the Contribution in connection with the Distribution. Post subsequently delivered the 7.00% Senior Notes to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post in an equal principal amount.\nOn March 10, 2022, in connection with the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement), which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility), with commitments to be made available to us in U.S. Dollars, Euros, and United Kingdom Pounds Sterling. The outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement must be repaid on or before March 10, 2027.\nPrior to the Transaction Agreement, BellRing LLC had entered into a credit agreement on October 21, 2019 (as subsequently amended, the Old Credit Agreement) which provided for debt facilities consisting of a $700.0 million term B loan facility (the Term B Facility) and a $200.0 million revolving credit facility (the Old Revolving Credit Facility). On March 10, 2022, with certain of the proceeds from the debt financing transactions described above, BellRing LLC repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance of $519.8 million on the Term B Facility and terminated all obligations and commitments under the Old Credit Agreement.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we borrowed $164.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid $65.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility. We had $151.0 million of borrowing capacity and no outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2022. Letters of credit are available under the Revolving Credit Facility in an aggregate amount of up to $20.0 million. The Credit Agreement provides for potential incremental revolving and term facilities at the Companys request and at the discretion of the lenders or other persons providing such incremental facilities, in each case on terms to be determined, and also permits the Company to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in the Credit Agreement.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, prior to the Spin-Off, we repurchased 0.8 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock at an average share price of $23.36 per share for a total cost of $18.1 million, including brokers commissions. In connection with the Spin-off, 0.8 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock held in treasury stock immediately prior to the Merger effective time were cancelled pursuant to the Transaction Agreement. On May 23, 2022, our Board of Directors approved a $50.0 million share repurchase authorization with respect to the shares of BellRing Common Stock. Our prior share repurchase authorization for Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was no longer applicable subsequent to the Spin-off. During the year ended September 30, 2022, subsequent to the Spin-off, we repurchased 1.1 million shares of BellRing Common Stock at an average share price of $23.18 per share for a total cost of $24.7 million, including brokers commissions.\nFor additional information on the Spin-off, Credit Agreement and share repurchases, see Notes 1, 14 and 17 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe expect to generate positive cash flows from operations and believe our cash on hand, cash flows from operations and possible future credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital requirements, research and development activities, debt repayments, share repurchases and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future. Our asset-light business model requires modest capital expenditures, with annual capital expenditures over the last three fiscal years averaging less than 1% of net sales. No significant capital expenditures are planned for fiscal 2023. Our cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments - See Note 14 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments.\nOperating Leases - See Note 11 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our operating leases and the timing of expected future payments.\nPurchase Obligations - Purchase obligations are legally binding agreements to purchase goods, services or equipment that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and/or penalties imposed for failing to meet contracted minimum purchase quantities (such as take-or-pay contracts); fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had total purchase commitments of $679.0 million (with $406.5 million due in fiscal 2023) which extend through fiscal 2027.\nOther liabilities - Other liabilities include obligations associated with certain employee benefit programs, general liability claim losses and provisions for legal matters, unrecognized tax benefits and various other long-term liabilities, all of which have some inherent uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payments and were reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022.\nOur ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions, competitive pressures and other business risk factors. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or otherwise to comply with the terms of our credit facilities, we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives. Additionally, we may seek to repurchase shares of our common stock. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nThe following table shows select cash flow data, which is discussed below.\nYear Ended September 30,\ndollars in millions 2022 2021 2020\nCash provided by (used in):\nOperating activities\n$ 21.0 $ 226.1 $ 97.2\nInvesting activities\n(1.8) (1.6) (2.1)\nFinancing activities\n(135.0) (120.9) (52.6)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(1.0) 0.3 0.7\nNet (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (116.8) $ 103.9 $ 43.2\nOperating Activities\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 decreased $205.1 million compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable changes related to an increase in inventory and fluctuations in the timing of sales and collections of trade receivables and purchases and payments of trade payables. Inventory increases were driven by input cost inflation, increased powder finished goods due to rebuilding inventory from supply-constrained levels at prior fiscal year end and increased raw material levels. Additionally, tax payments (net of refunds) increased by $22.6 million and interest payments increased by $9.3 million due to higher outstanding principal amounts of debt and a higher weighted-average interest rate as compared to the prior year period.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nCash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 increased $128.9 million compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by favorable changes related to fluctuations in the timing of purchases and payments of trade payables and the decrease in the current year inventory balance due to higher net sales outpacing production levels. In addition, interest payments decreased $13.1 million compared to the prior year due to lower aggregate principal amounts outstanding under the Term B Facility and Old Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the refinancing of the Term B Facility. These positive impacts were partially offset by restructuring costs payments of $4.7 million and increased tax payments of $1.9 million.\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal 2022 compared to 2021\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 increased $0.2 million compared to the prior year, resulting from an increase in capital expenditures.\nFiscal 2021 compared to 2020\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 decreased $0.5 million compared to the prior year, resulting from a decrease in capital expenditures.\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal 2022\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2022 was $135.0 million. We repaid the outstanding principal balance of the Term B Facility of $609.9 million, repaid $65.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility, and paid $115.5 million to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger. In addition, we paid $11.9 million of debt issuance costs, debt extinguishment costs and deferred financing fees related to the issuance of the 7.00% Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Facility, and we paid $42.8 million, including brokers commissions, for the repurchase of Common Stock. We received $550.4 million of cash from Post in connection with the Spin-off, which was partially offset by cash distributions to Post prior to the Spin-off of $3.2 million related to quarterly tax distributions pursuant to BellRing LLCs amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the BellRing LLC Agreement). Additionally, we borrowed $164.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nFiscal 2021\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $120.9 million. BellRing LLC drew an aggregate of $20.0 million under the Old Revolving Credit Facility, repaid $63.8 million on the principal balance of the Term B Facility and repaid $50.0 million on the Old Revolving Credit Facility during the year. In addition, BellRing LLC paid Post $24.6 million related to tax distributions pursuant to the BellRing LLC Agreement and state tax withholdings payments on behalf of Post.\nFiscal 2020\nCash used in financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $52.6 million. BellRing LLC received proceeds of $686.0 million, net of discount, related to the issuance of the Term B Facility and drew an aggregate of $195.0 million under the Old Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, we received $524.4 million from the issuance of the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock in conjunction with the IPO. BellRing LLC had net cash transfers of $32.1 million to Post which included cash deposits and borrowings prior to the IPO, tax distributions to Post pursuant to the BellRing LLC Agreement and state tax withholdings payments on behalf of Post. BellRing LLC also repaid the $1,225.0 million outstanding principal balance of a bridge loan assumed from Post in connection with the IPO, repaid $165.0 million on the Old Revolving Credit Facility and repaid $26.3 million on the principal balance of the Term B Facility. In connection with the issuance of BellRing LLCs long-term debt, BellRing LLC paid $9.6 million in debt issuance costs and deferred financing fees.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries for agreements of this type, including delivery of financial and other information; compliance with laws; maintenance of property, existence, insurance and books and records; inspection rights; obligation to provide collateral and guarantees by certain new subsidiaries; delivery of environmental reports; participation in an annual meeting with the agent and the lenders; further assurances; and limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, fundamental changes, restrictive agreements, use of proceeds, amendments of organization documents, prepayments and amendments of certain indebtedness, dispositions of assets, acquisitions and other investments, sale leaseback transactions, changes in the nature of business, transactions with affiliates and dividends and redemptions or repurchases of stock. Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, we are also required\nto comply with a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, which began with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022. We were in compliance with the financial covenant as of September 30, 2022, and we do not believe non-compliance is reasonably likely in the foreseeable future.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for potential incremental revolving and term facilities at our request and at the discretion of the lenders or other persons providing such incremental facilities, in each case on terms to be determined, and also permits us to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations on the amount as specified in the Credit Agreement.\nIn addition, the indenture governing the 7.00% Senior Notes contains customary negative covenants that limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things: borrow money or guarantee debt; create liens; pay dividends on, or redeem or repurchase, stock; make specified types of investments and acquisitions; enter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us; enter into new lines of business; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell assets or merge with other companies. Certain of these covenants are subject to suspension when and if the 7.00% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings.\nCOMMODITY TRENDS\nWe are exposed to price fluctuations primarily from purchases of ingredients and packaging materials, transportation costs and energy. Our principal ingredients are milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Our principal packaging materials consist of aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. These costs have been volatile in recent years, and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly. We manage the impact of cost increases, wherever possible, on commercially reasonable terms, by locking in prices on the quantities through purchase commitments required to meet our production requirements. In addition, we may attempt to offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to our customers. However, for competitive reasons, we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them.\nInflationary pressures can also have an adverse effect on us through higher raw material and energy costs. We experienced inflationary headwinds across our business during the year ended September 30, 2022; however, these impacts were largely mitigated through sales price increases and cost savings measures, when possible. We expect inflationary pressures to continue into fiscal 2023, and this trend could have a materially adverse impact in the future if inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases or cost savings.\nCURRENCY\nCertain sales and costs of our foreign operations are denominated in the Euro. Consequently, profits from these operations are impacted by fluctuations in the value of this currency relative to the U.S. Dollar. We incur gains and losses within our stockholders equity due to the translation of our financial statements from foreign currencies into U.S. Dollars. Our income statement trends may be impacted by the translation of the income statements of our foreign operations into U.S. Dollars. The exchange rates used to translate our foreign sales into U.S. Dollars negatively affected net sales by less than 1% during the year ended September 30, 2022, and did not have a material impact to our operating profit or net earnings during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the use of judgment, estimates and assumptions. We make these subjective determinations after considering our historical performance, managements experience, current economic trends and events and information from outside sources. Inherent in this process is the possibility that actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions for any particular period.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our critical accounting estimates are those that involve a significant amount of estimation uncertainty and have a meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue, Allowance for Trade Promotions - Many of our contracts with customers include some form of variable or fixed consideration. The most common forms of variable and fixed consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discount programs. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. The majority of\ntrade promotions are redeemed in the form of invoice credits against trade. However, the recognition of certain trade promotions requires significant management judgement regarding estimated purchase volumes and program participation. We review and update estimates of variable consideration quarterly. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. Approximately 1% of our annual net sales represent variable consideration that will be resolved in the subsequent period. We do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. However, significant changes in our estimates could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nIncome Tax - We estimate income tax expense based on income earned and taxed in various U.S. federal and state, as well as foreign, jurisdictions in accordance with our policy in Note 2 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that the future benefits will not be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for/(benefit from) income taxes.\nWe recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits is adjusted periodically due to changing circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, new or emerging legislation and tax planning. The tax position will be de-recognized when it is no longer more likely than not of being sustained.\nWe are subject to periodic audits by governmental tax authorities of our income tax returns. These audits generally include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, and record reserves for estimated exposures. See Note 7 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about estimates affecting income taxes.\nRECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 3 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding recently issued and adopted accounting standards. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which the Company operates. At the time of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had, and the Company does not currently expect to have, a significant impact on its exposure to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, among others. For additional discussion, refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7, as well as Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors in Part I of this report.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials. The Company manages the impact of cost increases, wherever possible, on commercially reasonable terms, by locking in prices on the quantities through purchase commitments required to meet production requirements. In addition, the Company may attempt to offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to customers. However, for competitive reasons, the Company may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as they are incurred.\nForeign Currency Risk\nRelated to Active Nutrition International GmbH whose functional currency is the Euro, the Company is exposed to risks of fluctuations in future cash flows and earnings due to changes in exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nLong-term debt\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding principal value indebtedness of $840.0 million related to its 7.00% Senior Notes and an aggregate principal amount of $99.0 million outstanding under its Revolving Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2021, BellRing LLC had an aggregate principal amount of $609.9 million outstanding on its Term B Facility. There were no amounts drawn under the Old Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2021. Borrowings under the\nRevolving Credit Facility bear, and borrowings under the Term B Facility and the Old Revolving Credit Facility bore, interest at variable rates.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the fair value of the Companys debt, excluding any borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, was $767.4 million and $613.8 million, respectively. Changes in interest rates impact fixed and variable rate debt differently. For fixed rate debt, a change in interest rates will only impact the fair value of the debt, whereas a change in the interest rates on variable rate debt will impact interest expense and cash flows. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the fixed rate debt by approximately $17 million as of September 30, 2022. The Company did not have fixed rate debt as of September 30, 2021. Including the impact of interest rate swaps, a hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on both interest expense and interest paid during both the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. For additional information regarding the Companys debt, see Note 14 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest rate swaps\nAs of September 30, 2021, the Company had interest rate swaps with a notional value of $350.0 million. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have had an immaterial impact on the fair value of the interest rate swaps as of September 30, 2021. As of September 30, 2022, the Company did not hold any interest rate swaps. For additional information regarding the Companys interest rate swap contracts, see Note 12 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements 54\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of BellRing Brands, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of BellRing Brands, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders' deficit and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nReceivables, net- Allowance for Trade Promotions\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, many of the Company's contracts with customers include some form of variable or fixed consideration. The most common forms of variable and fixed consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discount programs. These programs resulted in an allowance for trade promotions of $12.6 million which is reflected as a reduction of Receivables, net as of September 30, 2022. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. The Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration each period. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration.\nThe principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to receivables, net - allowance for trade promotions is a critical audit matter is the matter involved significant audit effort in performing procedures related to managements allowance for trade promotions.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the accuracy and valuation of the allowance for trade promotions. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing managements process for determining the allowance for trade promotions; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology; and (iii) testing the accuracy and relevance of underlying data used to determine the allowance for trade promotions by examining customer agreements and sales data on a test basis.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nBELLRING BRANDS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet Sales $ 1,371.5 $ 1,247.1 $ 988.3\nCost of goods sold 949.7 860.9 650.3\nGross Profit 421.8 386.2 338.0\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 189.7 167.1 151.8\nAmortization of intangible assets 19.7 51.2 22.2\nOther operating income, net - (0.1) -\nOperating Profit 212.4 168.0 164.0\nInterest expense, net 49.2 43.2 54.7\nLoss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net 17.6 1.6 -\nEarnings before Income Taxes 145.6 123.2 109.3\nIncome tax expense 29.6 8.8 9.2\nNet Earnings Including Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 116.0 114.4 100.1\nLess: Net earnings attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 33.7 86.8 76.6\nNet Earnings Available to Common Stockholders $ 82.3 $ 27.6 $ 23.5\nEarnings per share of Common Stock:\nBasic $ 0.88 $ 0.70 $ 0.60\nDiluted $ 0.88 $ 0.70 $ 0.60\nWeighted-Average shares of Common Stock Outstanding:\nBasic 93.5 39.5 39.4\nDiluted 93.8 39.7 39.5\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBELLRING BRANDS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet Earnings Including Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest $ 116.0 $ 114.4 $ 100.1\nHedging adjustments:\nNet loss on derivatives - - (10.4)\nReclassifications to net earnings 7.1 2.3 1.0\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nUnrealized foreign currency translation adjustments (2.9) (0.2) 1.4\nTax (expense) benefit on other comprehensive income (loss):\nNet loss on derivatives - - 0.8\nReclassifications to net earnings (0.4) (0.2) (0.2)\nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Including Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 3.8 1.9 (7.4)\nLess: Comprehensive income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest 38.3 88.2 70.6\nTotal Comprehensive Income Available to Common Stockholders $ 81.5 $ 28.1 $ 22.1\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBELLRING BRANDS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except share data)\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 35.8 $ 152.6\nReceivables, net 173.3 103.9\nInventories 199.8 117.9\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 12.4 13.7\nTotal Current Assets 421.3 388.1\nProperty, net 8.0 8.9\nGoodwill 65.9 65.9\nIntangible assets, net 203.3 223.1\nOther assets 8.7 10.5\nTotal Assets $ 707.2 $ 696.5\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt $ - $ 116.3\nAccounts payable 93.8 91.9\nOther current liabilities 49.7 43.1\nTotal Current Liabilities 143.5 251.3\nLong-term debt 929.5 481.2\nDeferred income taxes 2.2 7.6\nOther liabilities 8.2 21.9\nTotal Liabilities 1,083.4 762.0\nCommitments and Contingencies (See Note 15)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest - 2,997.3\nStockholders Deficit\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value;

(formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) closed its initial public offering (the IPO) of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock), and contributed the net proceeds from the IPO to BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and subsidiary of Old BellRing (BellRing LLC), in exchange for 39.4 million BellRing LLC non-voting membership units (the BellRing LLC units).\nAs a result of the IPO and certain other transactions completed in connection with the IPO (the formation transactions), BellRing LLC became the holder of the active nutrition business of Post Holdings, Inc. (Post), which until the completion of the IPO, had been comprised of Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (Premier Nutrition), Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (Dymatize), Supreme Protein, LLC, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International GmbH (Active Nutrition International). Old BellRing, as a holding company, had no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units and its indirect interests in the subsidiaries of BellRing LLC and had no independent means of generating revenue or cash flow. The members of BellRing LLC were Post and Old BellRing.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2022, Post completed its previously announced distribution of 80.1% of its ownership interest in BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) to Posts shareholders. On March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No.1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Transaction Agreement), by and among Post, Old BellRing, BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (Old BellRing Class B Common Stock), all of its BellRing LLC units and $550.4 of cash to BellRing (collectively, the Contribution) in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing (prior to the conversion of BellRing into a Delaware corporation) and the right to receive $840.0 in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% Senior Notes (as defined in Note 14).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock) to Post shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution (the Distribution). Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders.\nUpon completion of the Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was converted into one share of BellRing Common Stock and $2.97 in cash, or $115.5 total consideration paid to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders pursuant to the Merger. As a result of the transactions described above (collectively, the Spin-off), BellRing became the new public parent company of, and successor issuer to, Old BellRing, and shares of BellRing Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, pursuant to Rule 12g-3(a) promulgated thereunder.\nImmediately prior to the Spin-off, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units, equal to 71.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and one share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67% of the combined voting power of the common stock of Old BellRing.\nImmediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19.4 million shares, or 14.2%, of the BellRing Common Stock and Post shareholders owned approximately 57.3% of the BellRing Common Stock. The former Old BellRing stockholders owned approximately 28.5% of the BellRing Common Stock, maintaining the same effective percentage ownership interest in the Old BellRing business as prior to the Spin-off. As a result of the Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated, and Posts remaining ownership did not represent a controlling interest in BellRing.\nOn August 11, 2022, Post transferred 14.8 million of its remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of certain debt obligations of Post, which reduced Posts ownership of BellRing Common Stock to 3.4% as of September 30, 2022. In connection with this transaction, BellRing repurchased 0.8 million of the transferred shares from certain of the financial institutions.\nThe Company incurred separation-related expenses of $14.5, $0.2 and $1.9 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with its separation from Post. These expenses generally included third party costs for\nadvisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUnless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to the Company refer to Old BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods prior to the Spin-off and BellRing and its consolidated subsidiaries during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. The term Common Stock generally refers to Old BellRing Class A Common Stock and Old BellRing Class B Common Stock during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to BellRing Common Stock during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off. The term Net earnings available to Common Stockholders generally refers to net earnings available to Old BellRing Class A common stockholders during the periods prior to the Spin-off and to net earnings available to BellRing common stockholders during the periods subsequent to the Spin-off.\nThe Company is a consumer products holding company operating in the global convenient nutrition category and is a provider of ready-to-drink (RTD) protein shakes, other RTD beverages, powders and nutrition bars. The Company has a single operating and reportable segment, with its principal products being protein-based consumer goods. The Companys primary brands are Premier Protein and Dymatize.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - For the period prior to the IPO, the consolidated financial statements present the consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, financial position, cash flows and stockholders equity of the active nutrition business of Post. Certain Post corporate expenses were allocated to the Company for the period prior to the IPO.\nFor the periods subsequent to the IPO and prior to the Spin-off, the financial results of BellRing LLC and its subsidiaries were consolidated with Old BellRing, and a portion of the consolidated net earnings of BellRing LLC was allocated to the redeemable noncontrolling interest (the NCI). The calculation of the NCI was based on Posts ownership percentage of BellRing LLC units during each period between the IPO and the Spin-off, and reflected the entitlement of Post to a portion of the consolidated net earnings of BellRing LLC during such periods.\nFor the period subsequent to the Spin-off, Posts remaining ownership of BellRing no longer represented a NCI to the Company (see Note 6). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. See Note 5 for further information on transactions with Post included in these financial statements.\nUse of Estimates and Allocations - The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require certain elections as to accounting policy, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for trade promotions and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $35.8 and $152.6, respectively, in available cash, of which 20.9% and 5.5%, respectively, was outside of the United States (the U.S.). The Companys intention is to reinvest these funds indefinitely.\nReceivables - Receivables are reported at net realizable value. This value includes appropriate allowances for credit losses, cash discounts and other amounts which the Company does not ultimately expect to collect. To calculate the allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates uncollectible amounts based on a review of past due balances, historical loss information and an evaluation of customer accounts for potential future losses. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Receivables are written off against the allowance when deemed to be uncollectible based upon the Companys evaluation of the customers solvency. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nInventories - Inventories are generally valued at the lower of average cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Reported amounts have been reduced by a write-down for obsolete product and packaging materials based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales.\nRestructuring Expenses - Restructuring charges principally consist of severance and other employee separation costs. The Company recognizes restructuring obligations and liabilities for exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. Employee severance costs are expensed when they become probable and reasonably estimable under established severance plans. Restructuring charges were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company incurred restructuring charges of $4.7 during the year ended September 30, 2021. No restructuring charges were incurred during the years ended September 30, 2022 or 2020.\nProperty - Property is recorded at cost, and depreciation expense is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the property. Estimated useful lives range from 2 to 13 years for machinery and equipment; 1 to 33 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements; and 1 to 3 years for software. Total depreciation expense was $1.6, $2.5 and $2.9 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any gains and losses incurred on the sale or disposal of assets are included in Other operating income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Repair and maintenance costs incurred in connection with on-going and planned major maintenance activities are accounted for under the direct expensing method. Property consisted of:\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nLand and land improvements $ 0.7 $ 0.8\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 5.4 5.5\nMachinery and equipment 12.6 12.6\nSoftware 2.3 2.1\nConstruction in progress 0.5 0.6\n21.5 21.6\nAccumulated depreciation (13.5) (12.7)\nProperty, net $ 8.0 $ 8.9\nAs of both September 30, 2022 and 2021, the majority of the Companys tangible long-lived assets were located in Europe and had a net carrying value of $6.0 and $6.6, respectively; the remainder were located in the U.S.\nGoodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets. The Company conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment assessment performed may be either qualitative or quantitative; however, if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. The goodwill impairment qualitative assessment requires an analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.\nIf adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. The estimated fair value is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rate. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company performed a qualitative test and determined there were no indicators, including adverse trends in the business, that would indicate it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount. The Company last performed a quantitative test in fiscal 2019.\nThe Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge at September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020, as all reporting units with goodwill passed the qualitative impairment test.\nThe components of Goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at both the beginning and end of the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are presented in the following table.\nGoodwill, gross $ 180.7\nAccumulated impairment losses (114.8)\nGoodwill $ 65.9\nIntangible Assets - Intangible assets consist primarily of definite-lived customer relationships, trademarks and brands. Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets, which is provided on a straight-line basis (as it approximates the economic benefit) over the estimated useful lives of the assets, was $19.7, $51.2 and $22.2 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of September 30, 2022, amortization expense of $19.4 is expected in each of the next five fiscal years. Intangible assets consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nCarrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nAmount Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Net\nAmount\nCustomer relationships $ 178.3 $ (84.9) $ 93.4 $ 178.6 $ (75.3) $ 103.3\nTrademarks and brands 195.1 (85.2) 109.9 195.1 (75.3) 119.8\nOther intangible assets 3.1 (3.1) - 3.1 (3.1) -\nIntangible assets, net $ 376.5 $ (173.2) $ 203.3 $ 376.8 $ (153.7) $ 223.1\nIn December 2020, the Company finalized its plan to discontinue the Supreme Protein brand and related sales of Supreme Protein products. In connection with the discontinuance, the Company updated the useful lives of the customer relationships and trademarks associated with the Supreme Protein brand to reflect the remaining period in which the Company continued to sell existing Supreme Protein product inventory. Accelerated amortization of $29.9 was recorded during the year ended September 30, 2021 resulting from the updated useful lives of the customer relationships and trademarks associated with the Supreme Protein brand, which were fully amortized and written off as of September 30, 2021.\nRecoverability of Assets - The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred which might impair the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets, including property, identifiable intangibles, goodwill and right-of-use (ROU) assets. Definite-lived assets (groups) are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (group) may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life is no longer appropriate. The Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. If circumstances require that a definite-lived asset (group) be tested for possible impairment, the Company will compare the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset (group) to the carrying amount of the asset (group). If the carrying amount of the asset (group) is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, an impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset (group) exceeds its fair value. There were no indicators, including adverse trends in the business, that indicated that the carrying value of the Companys definite-lived assets (groups) were not recoverable in fiscal 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nDerivative Financial Instruments - In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials and supplies, interest rate risks relating to floating rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company utilizes swaps to manage certain of these exposures by hedging when it is practical to do so. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe Companys derivative programs may include strategies that do and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative is designated as a hedge on the date in which the derivative contract is entered. Derivatives could be designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge). Derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments, where changes in their fair values act as economic offsets to changes in fair values of the underlying hedged items and are not designated for hedge accounting. The Company does not have any derivatives currently or previously designated as a net investment or fair value hedge.\nFor cash flow hedges, gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash flows from derivatives that are accounted for as hedges and cash flows from derivatives that are not designated as hedges are classified in the same category on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged or on a basis consistent with the nature of the instruments.\nLeases - The Company leases office space, certain warehouses and equipment primarily through operating lease agreements. The Company has no material finance lease agreements. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. When the arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for them as a single lease component. Leases with an initial term of less than 12 months are not reported on the balance sheet, but rather are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Arrangements may include options to extend or terminate the lease\narrangement. These options are included in the lease term used to establish ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company will reassess expected lease terms based on changes in circumstances that indicate options may be more or less likely to be exercised.\nThe Company has certain lease arrangements that include variable rental payments. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown and therefore are not included in minimum rental payments used to determine ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company has lease arrangements where it makes separate payments to the lessor based on the lessor's common area maintenance expenses, property and casualty insurance costs, property taxes assessed on the property and other variable expenses. As the Company has elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components, these variable amounts are captured in operating lease expense in the period in which they are incurred. Variable rental payments are recognized in the period in which the associated obligation is incurred.\nFor lease arrangements that do not provide an implicit interest rate, an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is applied in determining the present value of future payments. The Companys IBR is selected based upon information available at the lease commencement date.\nROU assets are recorded as Other assets, and lease liabilities are recorded as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs associated with finance leases and lease income do not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nNet Investment of Post - Net Investment of Post on the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Deficit represents Posts historical investment in its active nutrition business, its accumulated net income and the net effect of the transactions with and allocations from Post prior to the IPO.\nRevenue - The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations have been satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is generally transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. At the time of delivery, the customer is invoiced using previously agreed-upon credit terms. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. The Companys contracts with customers generally contain one performance obligation.\nMany of the Companys contracts with customers include some form of variable or fixed consideration. The most common forms of variable and fixed consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discount programs. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, these programs resulted in an allowance for trade promotions of $12.6 and $19.4, respectively, which were recorded as a reduction of Receivables, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Methodologies for determining these provisions are dependent on specific customer pricing and promotional practices, which range from contractually fixed percentage price reductions to reimbursement based on actual occurrence or performance. The Company does not believe that there will be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. The Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration each period. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration. The majority of trade promotions are redeemed in the form of invoice credits against trade receivables.\nThe Companys products are sold with no right of return, except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged. No services beyond this assurance-type warranty are provided to customers. Customer remedies include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. As a result, the right of return and related refund liability is estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue based on historical sales return experience.\nCost of Goods Sold - Cost of goods sold includes, among other things, inbound and outbound freight costs and depreciation expense related to assets used in production, while storage and other warehousing costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Storage and other warehousing costs totaled $16.6, $17.0 and $17.4 in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAdvertising - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred, except for costs of producing media advertising such as television commercials or magazine and online advertisements, which are deferred until the first time the advertising takes place and amortized over the period the advertising runs. The amounts reported as assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets were immaterial as of both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nStock-based Compensation - Prior to the IPO, the Companys employees had solely participated in Posts stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense under Posts stock-based compensation plans had been allocated to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to its employees. Prior to and subsequent to the Spin-off, all awards outstanding under Posts stock-based compensation plans continued to vest and the Company recorded stock based-\ncompensation expense related to those awards. Subsequent to the IPO, the Companys employees also began to participate in the Companys 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nThe Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the equity or liability award. For liability awards, the fair market value is remeasured at each quarterly reporting period. The cost for equity and liability awards is recognized ratably over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award - the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Any forfeitures of stock-based awards are recorded as they occur. See Note 16 for disclosures related to stock-based compensation.\nIncome Tax Expense - Income tax expense is estimated based on income taxes in each jurisdiction and includes the effects of both current tax exposures and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the related deferred tax assets to the extent that it is not more likely than not that the future benefits will be realized. Reserves are recorded for estimated exposures associated with the Companys tax filing positions, which are subject to periodic audits by governmental taxing authorities. Interest incurred due to an underpayment of income taxes is classified as income tax expense.\nImmediately prior to the Spin-off, Old BellRing held 28.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC (see Note 1), which, as a result of the IPO and formation transactions, was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, BellRing LLC was itself generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. Old BellRing was subject to U.S. federal income taxes, in addition to state and local income taxes, with respect to its 28.5% distributive share of the items of income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC. Old BellRing was also subject to taxes in foreign jurisdictions. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes. See Note 7 for disclosures related to income taxes.\nNOTE 3 - RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded there are no new pronouncements (other than the ones described below) that had or will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows, stockholders equity or disclosures based on current information.\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers. This ASU requires a company to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASU No. 2014-19, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) as if it had originated the contracts. The Company early adopted this ASU as of October 1, 2021 on a prospective basis, as permitted by the ASU. The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. This ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity-linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The Company early adopted this ASU on October 1, 2021, using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope, respectively (collectively, Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions provided by Topic 848 are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company adopted Topic 848 on October 1, 2021. The adoption of Topic 848 did not have and is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.\nNOTE 4 - REVENUE\nThe following table presents net sales by product.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nShakes and other beverages $ 1,084.0 $ 1,014.2 $ 810.1\nPowders 242.2 178.6 121.7\nNutrition bars 36.0 45.2 49.3\nOther 9.3 9.1 7.2\nNet Sales $ 1,371.5 $ 1,247.1 $ 988.3\nThe Companys external revenues were primarily generated by sales within the U.S.; foreign sales were 11.3%, 11.7% and 11.1% of total fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 net sales, respectively. The largest concentration of foreign sales in fiscal 2022 was within Canada, which accounted for 35.4% of total foreign sales. The largest concentration of foreign sales in fiscal 2021 and 2020 was within Europe (with no individual countries within Europe accounting for a significant portion of total foreign sales), which accounted for 34.1% and 41.5% of total foreign net sales, respectively. Sales are attributed to individual countries based on the address to which the product is shipped.\nTwo customers individually accounted for more than 10% of total net sales in each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. One customer accounted for 31.9%, 31.5% and 31.6% of total net sales in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The other customer accounted for 31.6%, 33.8% and 35.7% of total net sales in the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nImmediately prior to the Spin-off, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units, equal to 71.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and one share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock, which represented 67% of the combined voting power of Old BellRing. Immediately following the Spin-off, Post owned 19.4 million shares, or 14.2%, of the BellRing Common Stock. On August 11, 2022, Post transferred 14.8 million of its remaining shares of BellRing Common Stock to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of debt obligations of Post, which reduced Posts ownership of BellRing Common Stock to 3.4% as of September 30, 2022. Both prior to and subsequent to the Spin-off, transactions with Post were considered related party transactions.\nThe Company sells certain products to, purchases certain products from and licenses certain intellectual property to and from Post and its subsidiaries based upon pricing governed by agreements between the Company and Post and its subsidiaries, consistent with prices of similar arm's-length transactions. During each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, net sales to and royalties paid to and received from Post and its subsidiaries were immaterial.\nThe Company incurred separation-related expenses of $14.5, $0.2 and $1.9 for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in connection with its separation from Post. Separation-related expenses were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company has a series of agreements with Post which are intended to govern the ongoing relationship between the Company and Post. Prior to the Spin-off, these agreements included the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of BellRing LLC (the BellRing LLC Agreement), an employee matters agreement, an investor rights agreement, a tax matters agreement, a tax receivable agreement and a master service agreement, among others. In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Post amended and restated the master services agreement (the MSA) and the employee matters agreement and entered into a new tax matters agreement (the Tax Matters Agreement). The previous investor rights agreement between the Company and Post was terminated, and the Company and Post entered into a new registration rights agreement. Under certain of these agreements, the Company incurs expenses payable to Post in connection with certain administrative services provided for varying lengths of time. The Company had immaterial receivables with Post at both September 30, 2022 and 2021 related to sales with Post and its subsidiaries. The Company had $1.4 and $2.2 of payables with Post at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to MSA fees and pass-through charges owed by the Company to Post, as well as related party purchases, which were recorded in Accounts payable, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe MSA\nThe Company uses certain functions and services performed by Post under the MSA. These functions and services include finance, internal audit, treasury, information technology support, insurance and tax matters, the use of office and/or data center space, payroll processing services and tax compliance services. Prior to the Spin-off, Post also provided legal services to the\nCompany. The MSA was amended and restated upon completion of the Spin-off to provide for similar services following the Spin-off and such other services as BellRing and Post may agree. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, MSA fees were $4.6, $2.2 and $2.2, respectively. MSA fees were reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nStock Based Compensation\nThe Company incurred pass-through charges from Post relating to stock-based compensation for employees participating in Posts stock-based compensation plans. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, stock-based compensation expense related to Posts stock-based compensation plans was $1.0, $2.6 and $3.9, respectively. See Note 16 for further information related to Posts stock-based compensation plans. Stock-based compensation expense was reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nTax Agreements\nPrior to the Spin-off, BellRing LLC made payments to Post related to quarterly tax distributions and state corporate tax withholdings made pursuant to the terms of the BellRing LLC Agreement. During the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, BellRing LLC paid $3.2, $20.4 and $21.4, respectively, to Post related to quarterly tax distributions and zero, $4.2 and $3.4, respectively, for state corporate tax withholdings on behalf of Post.\nBased on the provisions of the tax receivable agreement prior to the Spin-off, Old BellRing paid Post (or certain of its transferees or other assignees) 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal income tax, as well as state and local income tax and franchise tax (using an assumed tax rate) and foreign tax that Old BellRing realized (or, in some circumstances, was deemed to have realized) as a result of (a) the increase in the tax basis of assets of BellRing LLC attributable to (i) the redemption of Posts (or certain transferees or assignees) BellRing LLC units for shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock or cash, (ii) deemed sales by Post (or certain of its transferees or assignees) of BellRing LLC units or assets to Old BellRing (iii) certain actual or deemed distributions from BellRing LLC to Post (or certain transferees or assignees) and (iv) certain formation transactions, (b) disproportionate allocations of tax benefits to Old BellRing as a result of Section 704(c) of the Internal Revenue Code and (c) certain tax benefits (e.g., imputed interest, basis adjustments, etc.) attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nAmount payable to Post related to the tax receivable agreement of $0.1 were recorded to Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2022. Amounts payable to Post related to the tax receivable agreement of $0.3 and $10.2 were recorded to Accounts Payable and Other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2021.\nIn connection with and upon completion of the Spin-off, the Company entered into the Tax Matters Agreement by and among Post, BellRing and Old BellRing. The Tax Matters Agreement (i) governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes, including taxes arising in the ordinary course of business and taxes, if any, that may be incurred if the Distribution fails to qualify for its intended tax treatment, (ii) addresses U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax matters and (iii) sets forth the respective obligations of the parties with respect to the filing of tax returns, the administration of tax contests and assistance and cooperation on tax matters.\nPursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, BellRing is expected to indemnify Post for (i) all taxes for which BellRing is responsible (as described in the Tax Matters Agreement) and (ii) all taxes incurred by reason of certain actions or events, or by reason of any breach by BellRing or any of its subsidiaries of any of their respective representations, warranties or covenants under the Tax Matters Agreement that, in each case, affect the intended tax-free treatment of the Spin-off. Additionally, Post is expected to indemnify BellRing for the (i) taxes for which Post is responsible (as described in the Tax Matters Agreement) and (ii) taxes attributable to a failure of the Spin-off to qualify as tax-free, to the extent incurred by any action or failure to take any action within the control of Post. There were no amounts paid under the Tax Matters Agreement during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nReimbursement Agreement and Co-Packing Agreement\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2022, Premier Nutrition, a subsidiary of the Company, and Michael Foods, Inc. (MFI), a subsidiary of Post, entered into a reimbursement agreement relating to MFIs acquisition and development of property intended to be used as an aseptic processing plant for MFI or another subsidiary of Post to produce RTD shakes for Premier Nutrition (the Reimbursement Agreement). Pursuant to the Reimbursement Agreement, prior to the execution of a definitive agreement governing such production of RTD shakes for Premier Nutrition, Premier Nutrition would reimburse MFI for certain costs and expenses incurred in the acquisition and development of property for the processing plant. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Premier Nutrition did not reimburse MFI for any amounts under the Reimbursement Agreement and the Reimbursement Agreement terminated by its terms on September 30, 2022. On September 30, 2022, Premier Nutrition entered into a Co-Packing Agreement with Comet Processing, Inc. (Comet), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Post. Under the Co-Packing\nAgreement, Comet Processing will manufacture for Premier Nutrition, and Premier Nutrition will purchase from Comet, certain RTD shakes. During the year ended September 30, 2022, Premier Nutrition made no payments to Comet pursuant to the Co-Packing Agreement.\nNOTE 6 - REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nAt both September 30, 2021 and 2020, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units equal to 71.2% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and immediately prior to the Spin-off, Post held 97.5 million BellRing LLC units equal to 71.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC. Prior to the Spin-off, Post had the right to redeem BellRing LLC units for, at BellRing LLCs option (as determined by its Board of Managers), (i) shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock, at an initial redemption rate of one share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock for one BellRing LLC unit, subject to customary redemption rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassification or (ii) cash (based on the market price of the shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock).\nPosts ownership of BellRing LLC units prior to the Spin-off represented a NCI to the Company, which was classified outside of permanent stockholders equity as the BellRing LLC units were redeemable at the option of Post, through Posts ownership of the Companys Class B Common Stock (see Note 1). The carrying amount of the NCI was the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the NCIs share of net income or loss, other comprehensive income or loss and distributions or dividends or (ii) the redemption value. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying amount of the NCI was recorded at its redemption value of $2,997.3. Changes in the redemption value of the NCI were recorded to Additional paid-in capital, to the extent available, and Accumulated deficit on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAt both September 30, 2021 and 2020, Old BellRing owned 28.8% of the outstanding BellRing LLC units, and immediately prior to the Spin-off, Old BellRing owned 28.5% of the outstanding BellRing LLC units. Prior to the Spin-off, the financial results of BellRing LLC and its subsidiaries were consolidated with Old BellRing, and the portion of the consolidated net earnings of BellRing LLC to which Post was entitled was allocated to the NCI during each period.\nImmediately following the Spin-off and as of September 30, 2022, Post owned 14.2% and 3.4%, respectively, of the BellRing Common Stock, which did not represent a controlling interest in the Company. As a result of the Spin-off, the carrying amount of the NCI was reduced to zero immediately following the Spin-off.\nThe following table summarizes the changes to the Companys NCI. The period as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020 represents the period beginning October 21, 2019, the effective date of the IPO, and ending September 30, 2020 (see Note 1).\nAs Of and For The\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nBeginning of year $ 2,997.3 $ 2,021.6 $ -\nNet earnings attributable to NCI after IPO 33.7 86.8 71.1\nNet change in hedges, net of tax 5.1 1.6 (6.7)\nForeign currency translation adjustments (0.5) (0.2) 0.7\nImpact of IPO - - 1,364.6\nRedemption value adjustment to NCI (370.5) 887.5 591.9\nImpact of Spin-off (2,665.1) - -\nEnd of year $ - $ 2,997.3 $ 2,021.6\nThe following table summarizes the effects of changes in NCI on the Companys equity prior to the Spin-off. The Companys NCI was reduced to zero immediately following the Spin-off. The period as of and for the year ended September 30, 2020 represents the period beginning October 21, 2019, the effective date of the IPO, and ending September 30, 2020 (see Note 1).\nAs Of and For The\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet earnings available to common stockholders $ 82.3 $ 27.6 $ 23.5\nTransfers (from) to NCI:\nDecrease in equity as a result of the IPO - - 1,364.6\nChanges in equity as a result of redemption value adjustment to NCI (370.5) 887.5 591.9\nIncrease in equity as a result of the Spin-off (2,665.1) - -\nChanges from net earnings available to common stockholders and transfers (from) to NCI $ (2,953.3) $ 915.1 $ 1,980.0\nNOTE 7 - INCOME TAXES\nAt both September 30, 2021 and 2020, Old BellRing held 28.8% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC, and immediately prior to the Spin-off, Old BellRing held 28.5% of the economic interest in BellRing LLC (see Note 1). As a result of the IPO and formation transactions, Old BellRings economic interest was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, BellRing LLC was itself generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. Generally, items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC were passed through to its members, Old BellRing and Post. Old BellRing was responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of BellRing LLC allocated to it in accordance with the BellRing LLC Agreement and partnership tax rules and regulations.\nSubsequent to the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC for U.S. federal, state and local income tax purposes.\nThe expense (benefit) for income taxes consisted of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 28.0 $ 9.2 $ 10.7\nState 5.2 1.7 2.0\nForeign 0.4 (0.6) (0.2)\n33.6 10.3 12.5\nDeferred:\nFederal (3.4) (1.3) (2.0)\nState (0.6) (0.2) (1.3)\nForeign - - -\n(4.0) (1.5) (3.3)\nIncome tax expense $ 29.6 $ 8.8 $ 9.2\nThe effective income tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 20.3% compared to 7.1% for fiscal 2021 and 8.4% for fiscal 2020. The increase in the effective income tax rate compared to each of the prior years was primarily due to the change in tax expense allocation related to the Spin-off. After the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes, whereas in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, the Company reported 28.8% of such activity.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of income tax expense with amounts computed at the federal statutory tax rate.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nComputed tax (21%) $ 30.6 $ 25.9 $ 23.0\nIncome tax expense attributable to NCI (7.6) (19.5) (16.2)\nState income taxes, net of effect on federal tax 4.7 4.0 3.0\nTransaction costs 2.0 - (1.2)\nUncertain tax position - - 1.5\nOther, net (none in excess of 5% of computed tax) (0.1) (1.6) (0.9)\nIncome tax expense $ 29.6 $ 8.8 $ 9.2\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Deferred tax non-current assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nAssets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net\nStock-based compensation awards $ 1.6 $ - $ 1.6 $ 0.1 $ - $ 0.1\nAccrued vacation, incentive and severance 2.6 - 2.6 - - -\nInventory 4.1 - 4.1 - - -\nAccrued liabilities 4.7 - 4.7 2.5 - 2.5\nROU assets - (1.7) (1.7) - - -\nLease liabilities 1.7 - 1.7 - - -\nProperty - (0.4) (0.4) - - -\nIntangible assets - (14.8) (14.8) 1.0 - 1.0\nInvestment in partnership (a) - - - - (11.2) (11.2)\nDeferred income taxes $ 14.7 $ (16.9) $ (2.2) $ 3.6 $ (11.2) $ (7.6)\n(a)Prior to the Spin-off, Old BellRing held an economic interest in BellRing LLC which, as a result of the IPO and formation transactions, was treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, BellRing LLC itself was generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax under current U.S. tax laws. Generally, items of taxable income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC were passed through to its members, Old BellRing and Post. Old BellRing was responsible for its share of taxable income or loss of BellRing LLC allocated to it in accordance with the BellRing LLC Agreement and partnership tax rules and regulations. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC for U.S. federal, state, and local income tax purposes.\nNo provision has been made for income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries of $1.7 and $1.0 at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, as it is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable foreign withholdings that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings.\nFor fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, foreign income (loss) before income taxes was $1.1, $(1.9) and $(0.8), respectively.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Companys assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nUnrecognized tax benefits activity for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is presented in the following table:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nBalance, beginning of year $ 1.5 $ 1.5 $ -\nAdditions for tax positions taken in current year - - 1.5\nBalance, end of year $ 1.5 $ 1.5 $ 1.5\nThe amount of the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would directly affect the effective tax rate was $1.5 at September 30, 2022. None of the unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022 are expected to be recognized within the next twelve months.\nThe Company computes tax-related interest and penalties as the difference between the tax position recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount previously taken on the Companys tax returns and classifies these amounts as components of income tax (benefit) expense. During each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, expenses recorded related to interest and penalties were immaterial, and the Company had immaterial interest and penalty accruals at both September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nU.S. federal, U.S. state and German income tax returns for the tax years ended September 30, 2019 through September 30, 2021 are generally open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in each respective jurisdiction.\nNOTE 8 - EARNINGS PER SHARE\nPrior to the Spin-off, basic earnings per share was based on the average number of shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share was based on the average number of shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method. In addition, Net earnings available to common stockholders for diluted earnings per share in the table below was adjusted for diluted net earnings per share of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock attributable to NCI, to the extent it was dilutive.\nSubsequent to the Spin-off, basic earnings per share is based on the average number of shares of BellRing Common Stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the average number of shares of BellRing Common Stock used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nPrior to the Spin-off, the share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock did not have economic rights, including rights to dividends or distributions upon liquidation, and was therefore not a participating security. Subsequent to the Spin-off, the share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock was no longer outstanding. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share of Old BellRing Class B Common Stock under the two-class method has not been presented for any years.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The year ended September 30, 2020 represents the period beginning October 21, 2019, the effective date of the IPO, and ending September 30, 2020 (see Note 1).\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet earnings available to common stockholders for basic earnings per share $ 82.3 $ 27.6 $ 23.5\nDilutive impact of net earnings attributable to NCI - 0.2 0.1\nNet earnings available to common stockholders for diluted earnings per share $ 82.3 $ 27.8 $ 23.6\nshares in millions\nWeighted-average shares for basic earnings per share 93.5 39.5 39.4\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock units 0.2 0.2 0.1\nStock Options 0.1 - -\nWeighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share 93.8 39.7 39.5\nBasic earnings per share of Common Stock $ 0.88 $ 0.70 $ 0.60\nDiluted earnings per share of Common Stock $ 0.88 $ 0.70 $ 0.60\nWeighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share excluded 0.2, 0.2 and 0.1 of equity awards for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 9 - SUPPLEMENTAL OPERATIONS STATEMENT AND CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nAdvertising expenses $ 22.6 $ 39.1 $ 33.0\nResearch and development expenses 11.4 11.2 9.4\nInterest paid 45.0 35.7 48.8\nIncome taxes paid (a) 34.6 12.0 10.1\n(a)Subsequent to the Spin-off, the Company reported 100% of the income, gain, loss and deduction of BellRing LLC.

The Company has no material finance lease agreements. Leases have remaining terms which range from less than 1 year to 5 years and most leases provide the Company with the option to exercise one or more renewal terms.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location of the Companys operating leases.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\nROU assets:\nOther assets $ 7.5 $ 9.7\nLease liabilities:\nOther current liabilities $ 1.9 $ 2.3\nOther liabilities 6.6 8.6\nTotal liabilities $ 8.5 $ 10.9\nFuture maturities of the Companys operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2022 are presented in the following table.\nFiscal 2023 $ 2.2\nFiscal 2024 2.2\nFiscal 2025 2.1\nFiscal 2026 2.1\nFiscal 2027 0.7\nTotal future minimum payments 9.3\nLess: Implied interest (0.8)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 8.5\nThe following table presents supplemental information related to the Companys operating leases.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease expense $3.8 $3.7 $4.0\nVariable lease expense 0.9 0.7 0.6\nShort-term lease expense - - -\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n4 years 5 years 6 years\nWeighted-average incremental borrowing rate\n4.6% 4.3% 4.2%\nOperating cash flows for amounts included in the measurement of the Companys operating lease liabilities for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $2.2, $3.0 and $3.6, respectively. ROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial.\nNOTE 12 - DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials and supplies, interest rate risks relating to floating rate debt and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company utilizes swaps to manage certain of these exposures by hedging when it is practical to do so. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nAt September 30, 2021, the Company had pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $350.0. The interest rate swaps required monthly settlements, which began on January 31, 2020, and were used to hedge forecasted interest payments on the Companys variable rate debt (see Note 14). On April 1, 2020, the Company changed the designation of the interest rate swaps from cash flow hedges to non-designated hedging instruments as the swaps were no longer effective (as defined by GAAP). In connection with the new designation, the Company started reclassifying losses previously recorded in accumulated OCI to Interest expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the term of the related debt. At September 30, 2021, accumulated OCI, including amounts reported as NCI, included a $7.1 net hedging loss before taxes ($6.7 after taxes).\nIn connection with the extinguishment of Old BellRings debt (see Note 14), the Company paid $1.5 to settle its interest rate swaps associated with the extinguished debt in fiscal 2022. In addition, the Company reclassified to earnings the remaining unamortized net hedging losses and related tax benefits previously recorded to accumulated OCI of $6.1 and $0.4, respectively.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location and fair value of the Companys derivative instruments on a gross basis. The Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company held no material derivative instruments at September 30, 2022.\nSeptember 30, 2021\nOther current liabilities $ 4.7\nOther liabilities 1.1\nTotal liabilities $ 5.8\nThe following table presents the effects of the Companys interest rate swaps on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the net cash settlements paid on interest rate swaps.\nYear Ended September 30,\nHedging Activity Statement of Operations Location 2022 2021 2020\nMark-to-market adjustments Interest expense, net $ (2.3) $ 0.2 $ 1.6\nNet loss amortized from accumulated OCI Interest expense, net 1.0 2.3 1.2\nNet loss amortized from accumulated OCI Loss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net 6.1 - -\nTax benefit reclassified from accumulated OCI Income tax expense (0.4) (0.2) (0.2)\nTotal net hedging loss, net of tax $ 4.4 $ 2.3 $ 2.6\nCash settlements paid $ (2.0) $ (4.8) (1.8)\nNOTE 13 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the Companys liabilities and NCI measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement according to the levels in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had no material derivative liabilities and no NCI.\nSeptember 30, 2021\nTotal Level 1 Level 2\nDerivative liabilities $ 5.8 $ - $ 5.8\nNCI $ 2,997.3 $ 2,997.3 $ -\nAt September 30, 2021, the Companys calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps was derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve on a recurring basis. The fair value of the NCI was calculated as its redemption value based on the Old BellRing Class A Common Stock price and number of BellRing LLC units owned by Post at the end of the year (see Note 6).\nThe Companys financial assets and liabilities include cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable for which the carrying value approximates fair value due to their short maturities (less than 12 months). The Company does not record its short-term and long-term debt at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility (as defined in Note 14) as of September 30, 2022 approximated its carrying value. Based on market rates, the fair value (Level 2) of the Companys debt, excluding any borrowings under its revolving credit facilities, was $767.4 and $613.8 as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nCertain assets and liabilities, including property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. No impairment charges were recorded for property, goodwill, definite-lived or indefinite-lived intangibles during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nNOTE 14 - LONG-TERM DEBT\nThe components of Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented in the following table.\nSeptember 30,\n2022 2021\n7.00% Senior Notes maturing in March 2030 $ 840.0 $ -\nTerm B Facility - 609.9\nRevolving credit facilities 99.0 -\nTotal principal amount of debt 939.0 609.9\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt - 116.3\nDebt issuance costs, net 9.5 4.7\nUnamortized discount - 7.7\nLong-term debt $ 929.5 $ 481.2\nSenior Notes\nOn March 10, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company issued $840.0 aggregate principal amount of 7.00% senior notes maturing in March 2030 (the 7.00% Senior Notes) to Post as partial consideration for the Contribution in connection with the Distribution. Post subsequently delivered the 7.00% Senior Notes to certain financial institutions in satisfaction of term loan obligations of Post in an equal principal amount.\nThe 7.00% Senior Notes were issued at par, and the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $10.2, which were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the 7.00% Senior Notes. Interest payments are due semi-annually each March 15 and September 15, and began on September 15, 2022. The 7.00% Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of BellRing and are guaranteed by BellRings existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries and certain excluded subsidiaries). The maturity date of the 7.00% Senior Notes is March 15, 2030.\nCredit Agreement\nOn March 10, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, the Company entered into a credit agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement), which provides for a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 (the Revolving Credit Facility), with commitments made available to the Company in U.S. Dollars, Euros and United Kingdom (U.K.) Pounds Sterling. Letters of credit are available under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $20.0. The outstanding amounts under the Credit Agreement must be repaid on or before March 10, 2027.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to: (i) in the case of loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, at the Companys option, the base rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which was initially 2.00% and thereafter will range from 2.00% to 2.75% depending on the Companys secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), or the adjusted term SOFR rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period plus a margin which was initially 3.00% and thereafter will range from 3.00% to 3.75% depending on the Companys secured net leverage ratio; (ii) in the case of loans denominated in Euros, the adjusted Eurodollar rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable interest period plus a margin which was initially 3.00% and thereafter will range from 3.00% to 3.75% depending on the Companys secured net leverage ratio; and (iii) in the case of loans denominated in U.K. Pounds Sterling, the adjusted daily simple RFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin which was initially 3.00% and thereafter will range from 3.00% to 3.75% depending on the Companys secured net leverage ratio. Facility fees on the daily unused amount of commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility initially accrued at the rate of 0.25% per annum, and thereafter, will accrue at rates ranging from 0.25% to 0.375% per annum, depending on the Companys secured net leverage ratio.\nThe Company incurred $1.5 of financing fees in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility, which were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Revolving Credit Facility. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company borrowed $164.0 under the Revolving Credit Facility and repaid $65.0 under the Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2022 the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was 8.50%. The available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility was $151.0 as of September 30, 2022. There were no outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2022.\nUnder the terms of the Credit Agreement, BellRing is required to maintain a total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) not to exceed 6.00:1.00, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, which began with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2022. The total net leverage ratio of the Company did not exceed this threshold as of September 30, 2022.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for potential incremental revolving and term facilities at the Companys request and at the discretion of the lenders or other persons providing such incremental facilities, in each case on terms to be determined, and also permits the Company to incur other secured or unsecured debt, in all cases subject to conditions and limitations as specified in the Credit Agreement.\nFurthermore, the Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the maturity of the loans under the Credit Agreement may accelerate and the administrative agent and lenders under the Credit Agreement may exercise other rights and remedies available at law or under the loan documents, including with respect to the collateral securing, and guarantees of, the Companys obligations under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Companys obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by its existing and subsequently acquired or organized direct and indirect subsidiaries (other than immaterial subsidiaries and certain excluded subsidiaries) and are secured by security interests in substantially all of the Companys assets and the assets of its subsidiary guarantors, but excluding, in each case, real property.\nAssumption of Bridge Loan\nOn October 11, 2019, in connection with the IPO and the related formation transactions, Post entered into a $1,225.0 Bridge Facility Agreement (the Bridge Loan Facility) and borrowed $1,225.0 under the Bridge Loan Facility (the Bridge Loan). Certain of Posts domestic subsidiaries (other than Old BellRing but including BellRing LLC and its domestic subsidiaries) guaranteed the Bridge Loan.\nOn October 21, 2019, BellRing LLC entered into a Borrower Assignment and Assumption Agreement with Post and the administrative agent under the Bridge Loan Facility, under which BellRing LLC became the borrower under the Bridge Loan and assumed all interest of $2.2 thereunder, and Post and its subsidiary guarantors (other than BellRing LLC and its domestic subsidiaries) were released from all material obligations under the Bridge Loan. BellRing LLC did not receive any of the proceeds of the Bridge Loan. On October 21, 2019, the Bridge Loan was repaid in full. See below for additional information.\nOld Credit Agreement\nOn October 21, 2019, BellRing LLC entered into a credit agreement (as subsequently amended, the Old Credit Agreement) which provided for a term B loan facility in an aggregate original principal amount of $700.0 (the Term B Facility) and a revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $200.0 (the Old Revolving Credit Facility), with the commitments under the Old Revolving Credit Facility to be made available to BellRing LLC in U.S. Dollars, Euros and U.K. Pounds Sterling. Letters of credit were available under the Old Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount of up to $20.0.\nOn October 21, 2019, BellRing LLC borrowed the full amount under the Term B Facility and $100.0 under the Old Revolving Credit Facility. The Term B Facility was issued at 98.0% of par and BellRing LLC received $776.4 from the Term B Facility and Old Revolving Credit Facility after accounting for the original issue discount of $14.0 and paying investment banking and other fees of $9.6, which were deferred and were amortized to interest expense over the terms of the loans. BellRing LLC used the proceeds, together with the net proceeds of the IPO that were contributed to it by Old BellRing, (i) to repay in full the $1,225.0 of borrowings under the Bridge Loan and all interest thereunder and related costs and expenses, (ii) to pay directly, or reimburse Post for, as applicable, all fees and expenses incurred by BellRing LLC or Post in connection with the IPO and the formation transactions, (iii) to reimburse Post for the amount of cash on BellRing LLCs balance sheet immediately prior to the completion of the IPO and (iv) for general corporate and working capital purposes, as well as to repay $20.0 of outstanding borrowings under the Old Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn February 26, 2021, BellRing LLC entered into a second amendment to the Old Credit Agreement (the Amendment). In connection with the Amendment, BellRing LLC paid debt refinancing fees of $1.6 in the year ended September 30, 2021, which were included in Loss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOn March 10, 2022, with certain of the proceeds from the transactions related to the Spin-off, BellRing LLC repaid the aggregate outstanding principal balance of $519.8 on its Term B Facility and terminated all obligations and commitments under the Old Credit Agreement. The Company recorded a loss of $17.6 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which was included in Loss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. This loss included (i) a $6.9 write-off of unamortized discounts and debt extinguishment fees, (ii) a $6.1 write-off of unamortized net hedging losses recorded within accumulated OCI related to the Term B Facility (see Note 12) and (iii) a $4.6 write-off of debt issuance costs and deferred financing fees. Following the termination of the Old Credit Agreement, BellRing LLC and the guarantors had no further obligations under the Old Credit Agreement and the related guarantees other than customary indemnification obligations which continue.\nThe Term B Facility required quarterly scheduled amortization payments of $8.75 which began on March 31, 2020, with the balance to be paid at maturity on October 21, 2024. Interest was paid on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Old Credit Agreement) during each of the periods prior to the termination of the Old Credit Agreement. The Term B Facility contained customary mandatory prepayment provisions, including provisions for mandatory prepayment (a) from the net cash proceeds of certain asset sales and (b) of 75% of consolidated excess cash flow (as defined in the Old Credit Agreement) (which percentage would have been reduced to 50% if the secured net leverage ratio (as defined in the Old Credit Agreement) was less than or equal to 3.35:1.00 as of a fiscal year end). During the year ended September 30, 2022 and prior to the termination of the Old Credit Agreement, the Company repaid $81.4 on its Term B Facility as a mandatory prepayment from fiscal 2021 excess cash flow, which was in addition to the scheduled amortization payments. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company repaid $28.8 on its Term B Facility as a mandatory prepayment from fiscal 2020 excess cash flow, which was in addition to the scheduled amortization payments. The interest rate on the Term B Facility was 4.75% as of September 30, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Old Revolving Credit Facility bore interest, at the option of BellRing LLC, at an annual rate equal to either the Eurodollar rate or the base rate (determined as described above) plus a margin, which was determined by reference to the secured net leverage ratio, with the applicable margin for Eurodollar rate-based loans and base rate-based loans being (i) 4.25% and 3.25%, respectively, if the secured net leverage ratio was greater than or equal to 3.50:1.00, (ii) 4.00% and 3.00%, respectively, if the secured net leverage ratio was less than 3.50:1.00 and greater than or equal to 2.50:1.00 or (iii) 3.75% and 2.75%, respectively, if the secured net leverage ratio was less than 2.50:1.00. Facility fees on the daily unused amount of commitments under the Old Revolving Credit Facility accrued at rates ranging from 0.25% to 0.50% per annum depending on BellRing LLCs secured net leverage ratio. There were no amounts drawn under the Old Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2021.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, BellRing LLC borrowed $20.0 and $195.0 under the Old Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, and repaid $50.0 and $165.0 under the Old Revolving Credit Facility, respectively. There were no borrowings under or repayments on the Old Revolving Credit Facility during the year ended September 30, 2022 prior to the facility being terminated. The available borrowing capacity under the Old Revolving Credit Facility was $200.0 as of September 30, 2021. There were no outstanding letters of credit as of September 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022, expected principal payments on the Companys debt for the next five fiscal years were:\nFiscal 2023 $ -\nFiscal 2024 -\nFiscal 2025 -\nFiscal 2026 -\nFiscal 2027 99.0\nEstimated future interest payments on the Companys debt through fiscal 2027 are expected to be $324.4 (with $65.6 expected in fiscal 2023) based on the interest rates at September 30, 2022.\nNOTE 15 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nJoint Juice Litigation\nIn March 2013, a complaint was filed on behalf of a putative, nationwide class of consumers against Premier Nutrition in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The case asserted that some of Premier Nutritions advertising claims regarding its Joint Juice line of glucosamine and chondroitin dietary supplement beverages were false and misleading. In April 2016, the district court certified a California-only class of consumers in this lawsuit (this lawsuit is hereinafter referred to as the California Federal Class Lawsuit).\nIn 2016 and 2017, the lead plaintiffs counsel in the California Federal Class Lawsuit filed ten additional class action complaints in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of putative classes of consumers under the laws of Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan and Pennsylvania (the Related Federal Actions). These complaints contain factual allegations similar to the California Federal Class Lawsuit, also seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. The action on behalf of New Jersey consumers was voluntarily dismissed. Trial in the action on behalf of New York consumers was held beginning in May 2022, and the jury delivered its verdict in favor of plaintiff in June 2022. In August 2022, the Court entered a judgment in that case in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $12.9, which includes statutory damages and prejudgment interest. In October 2022, Premier\nNutrition filed its Notice of Appeal to the Ninth Circuit. The other eight Related Federal Actions remain pending, and the court has certified individual state classes in each of those cases (except New Mexico).\nIn April 2018, the district court dismissed the California Federal Class Lawsuit with prejudice. This dismissal was upheld on appeal by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 2020, and plaintiffs petition for an en banc rehearing by the Ninth Circuit was denied.\nIn September 2020, the same lead counsel re-filed this complaint against Premier Nutrition in California Superior Court for the County of Alameda, alleging identical claims and seeking restitution and injunctive relief on behalf of the same putative class of California consumers as the California Federal Class Lawsuit. Following the Norther Districts denial of Premier Nutritions motion to preliminarily enjoin this complaint under the doctrine of res judicata, Premier Nutrition appealed to the Ninth Circuit. In September 2022, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district courts denial of Premier Nutritions motion to preliminarily enjoin the complaint, holding that the Alameda Superior Court would have to decide whether plaintiffs claims are barred by res judicata. The hearing on Premier Nutritions motion for judgment based on res judicata is currently set for January 2023.\nIn January 2019, the same lead counsel filed an additional class action complaint against Premier Nutrition in California Superior Court for the County of Alameda, alleging claims similar to the above actions and seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief on behalf of a putative class of California consumers, beginning after the California Federal Class Lawsuit class period. This matter is set for trial in June 2023.\nThe Company continues to vigorously defend these cases and intends to appeal any adverse judgements and awards of damages. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these cases will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company expensed $7.5 related to the legal matter and plaintiff legal fees in connection with the Joint Juice litigation, which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Other than legal fees, no expense related to this litigation was incurred during the years ended September 30, 2021 or 2020. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had an estimated liability of $16.0 and $8.5, respectively, related to these matters that was included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, a voluntary product recall was initiated by one of the Companys contract manufacturers which produces RTD shakes for Premier Nutrition. The recall covered our products produced from December 8, 2021 through July 9, 2022 at one of the contract manufacturers facilities. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the recall and does not believe it will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information presently known, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, as well as from asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities (if any), are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate to the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, although it is difficult to estimate the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for compliance with regulatory matters, in the opinion of management, based upon the information currently available, the ultimate liability arising from such compliance matters is not expected to be material to the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nNOTE 16 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nPost Long-Term Incentive Plans\nPrior to the IPO, the Companys employees participated in various Post long-term incentive plans (the Post Long-Term Incentive Plans). The awards issued under the Post Long-Term Incentive Plans to the Companys employees (the Post Equity Awards) have a maximum term of 10 years. Subsequent to the IPO, BellRing employees were no longer eligible to receive new issuances of Post Equity Awards; however, BellRing employees continued to vest in any issued and outstanding Post Equity Awards, pursuant to the terms of the awards. The Company incurred pass through charges from Post relating to these Post Equity Awards. The following disclosures reflect the details of the Post Long-Term Incentive Plans related solely to the BellRing employees who participated in such plans.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, adjustments were made to the terms of outstanding Post Equity Awards to preserve their intrinsic value. The adjustments to the Post Equity Awards was based on the volume weighted average price of Post common stock during the five trading day period prior to and including March 10, 2022 and the volume weighted average price of Post common stock during the five trading day period immediately following March 10, 2022. The equity award adjustments made in connection with the Spin-off had an immaterial impact on the Companys Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total compensation cost for non-cash and cash stock-based compensation awards recognized was $1.0, $2.6 and $3.9, respectively, and the related recognized deferred tax benefit for each of those years was $0.1, $0.2 and $0.3, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the total compensation cost related to non-vested awards under the Post Long-Term Incentive Plans was immaterial.\nPost Stock Options\nInformation about Post stock options granted to BellRing employees is summarized in the following table.\nin millions, except options or where otherwise indicated Post Stock Options Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per\nShare (a) Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm in Years Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 38,314 $ 81.42\nGranted - -\nImpact of Spin-off 18,498 54.91\nExercised - -\nForfeited - -\nExpired - -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 56,812 54.91 5.21 $ 1.5\nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 56,812 54.91 5.21 1.5\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 56,812 54.91 5.21 1.5\n(a)The weighted-average exercise price per share for activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Post Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nThere were no Post stock options granted to BellRing employees or exercised during each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPost Restricted Stock Units (Post RSUs)\nInformation about Post RSUs granted to BellRing employees is summarized in the following table.\nPost RSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per\nShare (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 21,116 $ 104.26\nGranted - -\nImpact of Spin-off 5,592 n/a\nVested (26,708) 82.42\nForfeited - -\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 - -\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Post Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nThe grant date fair value of each Post RSU was determined based upon the closing price of Posts common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested Post RSUs was $104.26 and $99.83 at September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All Post RSUs had vested as of September 30, 2022. The total vest date fair value of Post RSUs that vested during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $2.3, $3.0 and $4.5, respectively.\nPost Cash Settled Restricted Stock Units (Post Cash RSUs)\nInformation about Post Cash RSUs granted to BellRing employees is summarized in the following table.\nPost Cash RSUs Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 3,000 $ 51.43\nGranted - -\nImpact of Spin-off 1,448 n/a\nVested (1,482) 34.68\nForfeited - -\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 2,966 34.68\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the Post Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nAt September 30, 2022, the 2,966 nonvested Post Cash RSUs were valued at the greater of the closing price of Posts common stock or the adjusted grant price of $34.68. Cash used to settle Post Cash RSUs was $0.1 for each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nBellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan\nSubsequent to the IPO, the Companys employees began participating in the BellRing Brands, Inc. 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the BellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan). On October 22, 2019, the Company registered shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock on a Form S-8 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for issuance under the BellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and the related Merger, all outstanding unexercised and unexpired options to purchase shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock, outstanding restricted stock units with respect to shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock and other equity awards with respect to shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock outstanding under the BellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan (the BellRing Equity Awards), whether or not exercisable or vested, were assumed by BellRing based on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Transaction Agreement. Additionally, the Board of Directors of BellRing approved adjustments to the terms of the outstanding BellRing Equity Awards to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards. The adjustments to the BellRing Equity Awards were based on the volume weighted average price of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock during the five trading day period prior to and including March 10, 2022 and the volume weighted average price of BellRing Common Stock during the five trading day period immediately following March 10, 2022. The equity award adjustments made in connection with the Spin-off had an immaterial impact on the Companys Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAwards issued under the BellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan have a maximum term of 10 years, provided, however, that the Corporate Governance and Compensation Committee of BellRings Board of Directors may, in its discretion, grant awards with a longer term to participants who are located outside of the U.S. At September 30, 2022 there were 1.7 million shares remaining to be issued for stock-based compensation awards under the BellRing Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total compensation cost for BellRings non-cash stock-based compensation awards recognized was $9.8, $4.6 and $2.5, respectively, and the related recognized deferred tax benefit was $1.2, $0.3 and $0.2 respectively. See Note 7 for discussion related to income taxes. As of September 30, 2022, the total compensation cost related to BellRings non-vested awards not yet recognized was $20.8, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years.\nBellRing Stock Options\nInformation about BellRing stock options is summarized in the following table.\nin millions, except options or where otherwise indicated BellRing Stock Options Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per\nShare (a) Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm in Years Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2021 258,969 $ 19.78\nGranted - -\nImpact of Spin-off 27,074 17.74\nExercised (27,056) 19.50\nForfeited - -\nExpired - -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 258,987 17.74 7.80 $ 0.7\nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2022 258,987 17.74 7.80 0.7\nExercisable at September 30, 2022 91,266 17.63 7.65 0.3\n(a)The weighted-average exercise price per share for activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the outstanding balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the BellRing Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nThe fair value of each BellRing stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes Model. BellRing uses the simplified method for estimating a stock option term as it does not have sufficient historical stock options exercise experience upon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term is estimated based on the awards vesting period and contractual term. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility trends and other factors. The risk-free rate is the interpolated U.S. Treasury rate for a term equal to the expected term. The weighted-average assumptions and fair values for BellRing stock options granted during the years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 are summarized in the table below. There were no BellRing stock options granted during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nSeptember 30,\n2021 2020\nExpected term (in years) 6.5 6.5\nExpected stock price volatility 38.5% 38.5%\nRisk-free interest rate 0.6% 1.6%\nExpected dividends -% -%\nFair value (per option) $7.79 $7.92\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $0.1 in the year ended September 30, 2022, and the Company received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $0.5 during the year ended September 30, 2022. There were no stock options exercised during the years ended September 30 2021 or 2020.\nBellRing Restricted Stock Units (BellRing RSUs)\nInformation about BellRing RSUs is summarized in the following table.\nBellRing RSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per\nShare (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 467,663 $ 19.85\nGranted 318,462 25.87\nImpact of Spin-off 56,106 n/a\nVested (209,790) 20.01\nForfeited (52,472) 20.59\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 579,969 21.23\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the BellRing Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nThe grant date fair value of each BellRing RSU was determined based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested BellRing RSUs was $21.23, $19.85 and $19.39 at September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total vest date fair value of BellRing RSUs that vested during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $5.2 and $3.0. No BellRing RSUs vested during fiscal 2020.\nBellRing Performance Restricted Stock Units (BellRing PRSUs)\nInformation about BellRing PRSUs is summarized in the following table.\nBellRing PRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per\nShare (a)\nNonvested at September 30, 2021 - $ -\nGranted 367,357 42.33\nImpact of Spin-off 7,862 n/a\nVested - -\nForfeited - -\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 375,219 41.44\n(a)The weighted-average grant date fair value for the activity subsequent to the Spin-off, including the nonvested balance as of September 30, 2022, reflects the adjustment to preserve the intrinsic value of the BellRing Equity Awards outstanding immediately prior to the Spin-off.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company granted BellRing PRSUs to certain employees and directors. These awards will be earned by comparing BellRings total shareholder return (TSR) during a period of approximately three years to the respective TSRs of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon BellRings ranking in its performance peer group when comparing TSRs, a recipient of the BellRing PRSU grant may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 260% of the target award. The fair value of each BellRing PRSU was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. There were no PRSUs granted during the years ended September 30, 2021 or 2020.\nThe weighted-average assumptions for BellRing PRSUs granted during the year ended September 30, 2022 are summarized in the table below.\nExpected term (in years) 2.9\nExpected stock price volatility 49.6%\nRisk-free interest rate 2.3%\nExpected dividends -%\nFair value (per BellRing PRSU) $42.33\nNOTE 17 - STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nIn connection with the Spin-off, 97.5 million shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued to Post, of which 78.1 million were distributed by Post to its shareholders in the Distribution, and 38.9 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were converted into 38.9 million shares of BellRing Common Stock (see Note 1). As of September 30, 2022, the Company had 136.4 million and 135.3 million shares of BellRing Common Stock issued and outstanding, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had 39.5 million shares of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding.\nOn May 23, 2022, the Companys Board of Directors approved a $50.0 share repurchase authorization with respect to the shares of BellRing Common Stock. The Companys prior share repurchase authorization for Old BellRing Class A Common Stock was no longer applicable subsequent to the Spin-off.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys repurchases of BellRing Common Stock subsequent to the Spin-off.\nYear Ended September 30, 2022\nShares repurchased (in millions)\n1.1\nAverage price per share including brokers commissions $ 23.18\nTotal cost including brokers commissions $ 24.7\nThe following table summarizes the Companys repurchases of Old BellRing Class A Common Stock prior to the Spin-off.
