    "content": "Item 1 Business.\nOverview\nWe are a medical robotics company developing a fully autonomous medical robotic system using proprietary software which integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning, or machine learning, (DL). By using an AI and DL enhanced software program, we are creating an intelligent robotic system that we believe can robotize a wide range of medical procedures currently being performed by human hands. We are concentrating our research and development efforts to meet rising expectations of patients and practitioners alike for the precision, safety and speed offered by an AI enhanced robotics platform system that can be combined with proven medical devices, end-effectors and surgical instruments.\nWe believe that progress in mechanical and software engineering has made possible lightweight and relatively inexpensive robotic devices for difficult procedures in various medical fields. Medical robots are already being successfully employed in several areas of surgery, including Urology (Prostate), Colo-Rectal, Gynecology, Thoracic, General Surgery, Orthopedics, and Neuro and Spine Surgery. Robots are also being used for Telemedicine and assistive robotic methods are addressing the delivery of healthcare in inaccessible locations, ranging from rural areas lacking specialist expertise to post-disaster scenarios, and battlefield areas. With the aging population dominating demographics in the U.S. across all spectrums of healthcare, robotic technologies are being developed toward promoting improved function, lower morbidity and improved overall outcomes.\nWe are developing a treatment-independent autonomous robotics system utilizing our proprietary AI-driven precision guidance system, applicable to a variety of minimally and non-invasive procedures, with an initial focus on skin resurfacing aesthetic procedures utilizing several FDA approved skin enhancing techniques robotized for superior performance and optimal results. Our medical robotic system is being developed to deliver skin resurfacing treatments, such as micro-needling and laser therapies with improved efficiency, accuracy and precision over current procedures conducted by human hand, and only requiring the doctor to input or just confirm treatment parameters. As a result, use of our medical robotic system is expected to provide improved quality and safety as well as improve patient throughput and workflow.\nOur autonomous medical robotics system is being developed to be compatible with available FDA approved surgical tools and end-effectors, enabling us to initially penetrate a sizable and fast-growing aesthetics market, which includes micro-needling and laser solutions. Our robotics system will allow doctors, and anyone permitted to treat patients, defined at the State level, such as a licensed aesthetician, to treat damaged skin autonomously by delivering, for example, micro-needling to the skin. The micro-needling catalyzes the natural process of collagen remodeling, consisting of formation of new collagen, elastin, and vascularization in the papillary dermis, similar to the effect of laser treatments.\nWe expect our robotic system to eliminate many of the common errors that occur during handheld procedures, such as over- or under- exposure of the needles or energy-based instruments that can have terrible cosmetic results and even injure the patient. In addition, our system is being designed to continuously adjust treatment parameters, such as penetration depth, time, and energy in order to individualize the outcome based on our algorithms. Our robotic system has been designed and developed through a seamless collaboration of the surgeon, the engineer and the scientist. Since the medical robotic industry has progressed greatly in miniaturization, adaptability and lower costs, we believe that the Avra brains technology component can lead to dramatic opportunities in all of medicine.\nThe advantages of robotizing already FDA approved aesthetic devices are many. In contrast to a human using a handheld device, our aesthetics robotic system has the potential to perform each and every procedure with unsurpassed precision without constraint of age, proficiency, experience or fatigue. Likewise, in many skin related treatments the amount of energy delivered, distance and/or depth of the instrument to, or into, the skin, and treating only the affected area are critical to the outcome. The robotic system can maintain these parameters with unparalleled accuracy. The system can also replicate the same procedure time and again precisely. Delivery of certain aesthetic treatments by robotic systems is believed to be the most efficient option, requiring fewer visits per patient while increasing patient throughput - a benefit for patients and practitioners alike.\nAdvantages of using our medical robotic approach to procedures include:\n\u25cf Reduced cost per treatment.\n\u25cf Better treatment accuracy.\n\u25cf Better treatment outcomes.\n\u25cf Increased patient throughput and revenue generation for the physician.\n\u25cf Easier multi-platform integration.\n\u25cf Addresses shortfall of physicians/surgeons.\n\u25cf Easier future integration of medical and technological advancements such as molecular biologics.\nWe believe that our initial medical robotic system for the aesthetics market should find rapid acceptance based on the aforementioned advantages of using the attribute of robotics versus traditional manual applications. Furthermore, there is general acceptance by consumers for fee-for-service cash payments in the facial aesthetics market thereby avoiding medical insurance reimbursement issues. Our medical robotic system utilizes a robotic arm that has 7-degrees of freedom integrated with our proprietary AI-driven control software and algorithms. The robotic arm was designed and built under the required medical device standards of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA). Our strategy is to integrate the robotic arm with FDA approved devices, which is expected to allow for a more expedited approval of the integrated system. We believe that the FDA approval process will primarily focus upon validation of the medical robotic systems software control. This could lead to a less onerous, more de-risked regulatory path to approval, particularly if strong preclinical results are achieved. Subsequent to the completion of the FDA preclinical work, estimated to take six months, we believe that we will be able to additionally modify and robotize certain non-invasive instruments that do not require FDA approvals and proceed to the cosmetic treatments marketplace. This action could sharply reduce the time to commercial operations and revenues.\nWe previously retained the services of The Horizon Phoenix Group (HPG), a consulting firm experienced in securing U.S. and foreign regulatory approvals for medical devices, in order to initiate the regulatory process. Working with HPG, we prepared and filed an application with the FDA for our initial medical robotic system and in August 2019 held an initial pre-collaboration meeting with the FDA. We believe that this is the first of a series of meetings where the Avra system and its regulatory requirements will be discussed in ever-increasing specificity. This should allow for a more focused regulatory process, saving both resources and time. The robotic arm that we intend to utilize for our system has already been granted approval in the EU and received a CE mark. We have begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for our medical robotic system. The Medical Device Single Audit Program(MDSAP), which we plan to employ, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to these six most important medical device marketplaces.\nSince 2016, we had a research partnership with the University of Central Florida (UCF) to develop a prototype intelligent medical robotic system. UCF is recognized particularly for its work in the area of medical robotic research and design, with a focus on the guidance systems. Avra has paid UCF a one-time fee for outright ownership of work developed by UCF in the collaboration. The Research Agreement was extended several times and expired on April 30, 2021. To further the depth of our research and development we also began a partnership in 2021 with Florida Polytechnic University and are actively working with them on developing our system. Avra recently brought in two Associate Professors and three graduates to join Avras engineering development team. Effective October 11th, 2021 Avra executed a Sponsored Student Project Agreement which includes two payments of $8,030 each covering Fall semester in 2021 and Spring semester in 2022.\nRecent Developments\nOn August 5, 2022, AVRA entered into a non-binding letter of intent with Dr. Sudhir Srivastava (Dr. Srivastava), Cardio Ventures Pvt. Ltd., a Bahamian private limited company of which Dr. Srivastava is the sole stockholder(Cardio), Otto Pvt, Ltd., a Bahamian private limited company and direct subsidiary of Cardio (Otto) and Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt. Ltd., an Indian private limited company and indirect subsidiary of Cardio (SSI, and together with Cardio and Otto, the SSI Parties) with respect to a business combination between AVRA and the SSI Parties (the Transaction). SSI, based in Haryana, India is engaged in the development, commercialization, manufacturing and sale of medical and surgical robotic systems utilizing patents, trademarks and other intellectual property held by Dr. Srivastava (the SSI Intellectual Property).\nIf and when the transaction is consummated, the business of the SSI Parties, including the SSI Intellectual Property will be owned by AVRA. The shareholders of the SSI Parties will own 95% of the common stock of post-transaction AVRA and the current shareholders of AVRA will own 5% of the common stock of post-transaction AVRA. In addition, there will be changes in composition of the board of directors, implementation of corporate governance policies and changes in management, all with a view to listing the common stock of AVRA on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC or another National Securities Exchange. In addition, AVRA will change its name to SS Innovations, Inc.\nConsummation of the Transaction is subject to, among other matters, the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements and documentation, containing, in addition to the above terms, terms and conditions customary for agreements of this type and nature, including, without limitation, representations, warranties, and indemnities of the parties.\nConsummation of the Transaction is also subject to completion of a due diligence review by each party of the other, the results of which shall be satisfactory to the reviewing parties in their sole discretion.\nGiven the foregoing, there can be no assurance given that the Company will be able to successfully complete the Transaction.\nIn connection with executing the letter of intent, we advanced the SSI Parties, the amount of $990,000 (the Interim Financing). The Interim Financing is evidenced by two notes, one for $100,000 and one for $1,000,000. Both are one-year Automatically Convertible Notes made in favor of the Company by Cardio, Otto and Dr. Srivastava, jointly and severally (the Cardio Notes). Interest on the Cardio Notes shall accrue at the rate of 7% per annum, payable together with the principal amount at maturity. The Cardio Notes have an original issue discount of 10%. If the Cardio Notes are not repaid in full on or at maturity, they will automatically convert into a percentage equity interest in Cardio determined by dividing the principal amount of and accrued interest on the Cardio Notes divided by $100 million. The Cardio Notes contains customary default provisions and other typical terms and conditions.\nWe may make additional advances to the SSI Parties of up to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 of Interim Financing, evidenced by additional Cardio Notes. These Cardio Notes will be substantially similar in form and substance to the first Cardio Note, provided, however, that Cardio Notes issued in excess of an aggregate principal amount of $2.000,000, will have an original issue discount of 6% as opposed to 10%, and the valuation for determining conversion will be $250 million as opposed to $100 million.\nIn order to fund the Interim Financing, the Company offered and sold to two accredited investors, $1,000,000 and $100,000 one-year convertible promissory notes (the Convertible Notes). The Convertible Notes will have the same interest rate and payment terms as the Cardio Notes and otherwise be substantially similar to the Cardio Notes, provided, however, that the Convertible Notes do not have an original issue discount. Further, upon consummation of the Transaction (if and when it is consummated) the Convertible Notes will automatically convert into a number of AVRA Shares determined by dividing the principal amount of the Convertible Notes by $100 million and multiplying such number expressed as a percentage by the number of AVRA Shares issued to Dr. Srivastava and the other shareholders of the SSI Parties (if any) upon closing of the Transaction. The Company may offer and sell up to an aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 in Convertible Notes in order to fund the Interim Financing.\nThe Convertible Notes were issued in a private transaction pursuant to the exemptions from registration under the Section 4(a)2 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.\nAdvantages of Our Senior Leadership Team\nOur senior leadership team and advisory boards have broad and deep experience in clinical practice, medical research, innovation and development in the medical robotics field. We believe that our team, which has been active in the medical robotics field for many years, brings the necessary skills and experience to develop and commercialize intelligent medical robotic systems, as well as in marketing, supply chain management, and the implementation of all other aspects of our planned business operations.\nWe believe we can rapidly develop and commercialize its initial medical robotic system in the aesthetic skin resurfacing market because of the following advantages and progress made to date, including:\n\u25cf Our team is experienced in medical robotic engineering.\n\u25cf We are working in conjunction with preeminent physicians, engineers and scientific institutions.\n\u25cf We have substantially completed the design phase and are ready to complete a final, integrated prototype for the regulatory approval process which has been initiated.\n\u25cf Our robotic arm was built under the required medical device standards of the FDA and has already received a CE Mark in Europe.\n\u25cf Our strategy is to integrate the robotic arm with FDA approved devices for skin resurfacing, which we anticipate will allow for a more expedited regulatory approval, with the FDA approval process primarily focused upon validation of the medical robotic systems software control. We held a pre-collaboration meeting with the FDA in August 2019, which should allow us to better focus on only the meaningful required activities, saving both resources and time.\n\u25cf We have begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for AVRAs medical robotic system. MDSAP, which we plan to employ, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to the six most important medical device marketplaces.\n\u25cf We believe that our treatment-independent medical robotics platform system will be compatible with currently and yet to be approved end-effectors and/or surgical tools enabling rapid entry into the skin resurfacing and other markets with new and improved devices.\nMedical Robotic and Skin Rejuvenation Markets\nThe United States is expected to see a shortage of nearly 122,000 physicians by 2032 as demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply, according to new data published by the AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges). This trend is unfortunately being seen in the rest of the world as well. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there is a global shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses, and other health professionals. The shortage is often starkest in developing nations due to the limited numbers and capacity of medical schools in these countries.\nOne solution that is expected to mitigate this shortage will be the growing use of robotic systems for both their ability to be used remotely by the doctor (i.e. a doctor could, from a central location, cover anywhere in the world given proper connectivity), but also for their ability to increase the efficiency of existing practitioners. The ever-growing high cost of healthcare is also a driver for the growth in the use of robotic systems.\nAdvantages of using medical robotics include:\n\u25cf Reduced cost per treatment\n\u25cf Better treatment accuracy\n\u25cf Better treatment outcomes\n\u25cf Increase patient throughput\n\u25cf Easier multi-platform integration\n\u25cf Addresses shortfall of physicians/surgeons\nThe concept of using a robot in surgical procedures became a practical reality in 2000, when the FDA approved the da Vinci\u00ae robotic system, introduced to the market by Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG). For years, ISRG was essentially the sole company manufacturing and marketing robotic devices for use in the rapidly emerging field of robotic assisted, minimally invasive surgery.\nToday, the U.S. is the leader in robot-assisted surgery. However, other countries are fast followers, having already recognized both the need and the promise of such technologies. The development of surgical robotics is motivated by the desire to enhance the effectiveness of a procedure by coupling information to action in the operating room or interventional suite and transcend human physical limitations in performing surgery and other interventional procedures, while still affording human control over the procedure. Two decades after the first reported robot assisted surgical procedure, surgical robots are now being widely used in the operating room. According to Kenneth Research, the worldwide medical robotics market is projected to reach $11.36 billion by 2023, expanding at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.6% during 2018-2023.\nAccording to Kenneth Research, North America is currently the worlds largest market for medical robotics, holding an over 40% market share as of 2019, with significant growth expected in the coming years.\nGrowth in North America is driven by a few factors including the high rate of adoption of these new technologies and the growing demand for more precise, less invasive, and safer surgical methods. The overall growth of this industry is driven by the rising demand for these technologies, the growing and aging population, as well as increasing healthcare expenditures.\nDue to the growth in robotics for medical applications over the last several years, the medical robotics space has seen increasing mergers and acquisitions activity and we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future. Some recent examples include:\n\u25cf Medtronics acquisition of Mazor Robotics in September 2018 for $1.6 billion.\n\u25cf Johnson & Johnsons acquisition of Auris Health in February 2019 for $5.75 billion (Johnson & Johnson is now a shareholder of Avra through its ownership of Auris Health, which was one of the founding shareholders of Avra.\n\u25cf Strykers acquisition of Orthoscape in March 2019 for $220 million.\n\u25cf Intuitive Surgicals acquisition of Sch\u00f6lly Fiberoptics robotic endoscope business in July 2019 for an undisclosed sum.\n\u25cf Siemens Medical Solutions acquisition of Corindus Vascular Robotics in August 2019 for $1.1 billion.\nSimilar to growth in the use of medical robots in various procedures, the demand for skin rejuvenation procedures is also rapidly growing, which is a primary reason why we chose the skin rejuvenation market as our initial point of entry into the medical robotics field. According to a research letter published by Jama Network, in 2016, the total number of dermatology providers was 13,365 (10,845 dermatologists and 2,520 dermatology physician assistants). The global medical aesthetic market is expected to reach $16.7 billion by 2022, with North America remaining the largest single market.\nAccording to the National Laser Institute, between 2000 and 2018, the total number of non-surgical cosmetic treatments performed increased by 228% with 15.9 million non-surgical cosmetic treatments performed in 2018. The National Laser Institute also estimated that over $16.5 billion was spent in the U.S. on cosmetic procedures in 2018.\nAccording to a research study by Persistence Market Research, the global market for skin rejuvenation is projected to reach a CAGR of 8.7%. By region, the North American and Asian Pacific excluding Japan (APEJ) regions reflect high potential in the years to come. The North American region is expected to dominate the global market as it is estimated to be the largest and highly attractive for skin rejuvenation. The North American skin rejuvenation market is estimated to reach a CAGR of 9.4% at its peak.\nMost products designed to improve the appearance of the skin do not repair the skin itself; rather, they cover and hide scarring and blemishes temporarily. Wrinkles also are challenging as the skin ages and are hard to cover over. Some current treatments aim to slow or forestall the development of wrinkles, but with questionable effectiveness. Micro-needling and laser treatments are two common ablative procedures currently in use today for skin resurfacing, specifically focused on tone, texture and skin tightening. Other platforms include radiofrequency, ultrasound, cryolipolysis, and a multitude of laser frequencies that are available to practitioners.\nMicro-needling is used to treat and improve conditions like acne scarring, fine lines and wrinkles, loose skin, skin texture, pore size, brown spots, stretch marks, and pigment issues. It is also called skin needling, collagen induction therapy (CIT), and percutaneous collagen induction (PCI). Most anyone can have the procedure performed, as long as they do not have any active infections, lesions, or any known wound healing problems.\nMicro-needling is typically performed in a series of four to six sessions, spaced about a month apart. During the procedure, a topical anesthetic is applied, and then stainless-steel micro-needles are inserted into the skin to cause microinjuries or punctures. The damage caused by the needles encourages the body to send healing agents (elastin and collagen) to the punctures to repair them. According to a 2008 study, skin treated with four micro-needling sessions spaced one month apart produced up to a 400% increase in collagen and elastin six months after completing treatment.\nLaser resurfacing also can shrink wrinkles, even eliminating small wrinkles, by removing the outer layer of skin, allowing new skin to form. While simple, this procedure can be painful. Laser resurfacing works by burning off skin; skin can reach 1500\u00b0F (800\u00b0C) in the process of being removed, and adjacent areas of skin can approach 400\u00b0F. Unsurprisingly, general anesthesia is often required. Open wounds are created and healing may take up to three weeks. Skin redness may persist for three months, during which the skin is particularly sensitive to UV light. Other risks of laser resurfacing include scarring, changes in skin pigmentation and bacterial infection. Most, if not all, of the more severe adverse effects of laser resurfacing treatments are due to errors in the application of the treatment. Applying the laser too close to the skin, for too long on one area of the skin, and at the wrong settings, are just some examples of human errors for this procedure. Robotizing this procedure could reduce, if not eliminate, these human errors.\nA recent study by Yongsoo Lee, M.D., co-CEO and co-founder, Oh and Lee Medical Robot, Inc., in South Korea, presented at the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery meeting held in April 2017, comparing the improvements in the evenness of laser irradiation using a robot versus manual irradiation found the robot-guided treatment to be much more accurate than the human hand, achieving superior outcomes. Results of the study showed that robotic irradiation demonstrated consistency in distances between beams and distribution in fractions at both 30 and 10 Hz frequencies and was significantly superior to manual irradiation in the ratio of area covered by beams to regions of interest, distances between beams, and distribution in fractions at each frequency. The investigators concluded the robot-guided treatment to be superior to the manually guided treatment.\nAs an aesthetic dermatologist myself, I can appreciate that virtually all doctors would welcome the robot-guided treatments, as valuable time can be saved in the busy practice. That saved time can then be invested in other patients and procedures, allowing physicians to see more patients per day. Moreover, due to the heightened precision of robotic-guided treatments, cosmetic treatments are much safer with a significantly reduced chance of adverse events occurring such as burns and spotty hypopigmentation, Dr. Lee said.\nTechnology Overview\nCurrent robots used in surgery are under the direct control of a surgeon - the so-called Master-slave system, often in a teleoperation scenario in which a human operator manipulates a master input device and the patient-side robot follows the input. There is no autonomy. Traditional minimally invasive surgical robots provide the surgeon with a higher degree of dexterity inside the body, eliminate operator tremor, scale down operator motions to a fraction of normal distances, and provide a very intuitive connection between the operator and the instrument tips. The surgeon can cut, cauterize, suture and reconstruct tissue with accuracy equal to or better than that of invasive open surgery. A surgical system contains both robotic devices and real-time imaging devices to visualize the operative field during the course of surgery.\nThe use of robotics in medicine inherently involves physical interaction between caregivers, patients, and robots - in all combinations.\nDeveloping user-friendly physical interfaces between humans and robots requires all the classic elements of a robotic system: sensing, perception, and action. A great variety of sensing and perception tasks are required, including recording the motions and forces of a surgeon to infer their intent, determining the mechanical parameters of human tissue, and estimating the forces between a robot and a moving patient. The reciprocal nature of interaction means that the robot will also need to provide useful feedback to the human operator, whether that person is a caregiver or a patient. We need to consider systems that involve many human senses, the most common of which are vision, haptics (force and tactile), and sound. A major reason why systems involving physical collaboration between humans and robots are so difficult to design well is that, from the perspective of a robot, humans are extremely uncertain and dynamic.\nUnlike in a passive, static environment, humans dynamically change their motion, force, and immediate purpose throughout a procedure. These changes can be caused by something as simple as physiologic movement (e.g., a patient breathing during surgery), or as complex as the motions of a surgeon suturing during surgery. During physical interaction with a robot, the human is an integral part of a closed-loop feedback system, simultaneously exchanging information and energy with the robotic system, and thus cannot simply be thought of as an external system input002E\nIn addition, the loop is often closed with both human force and visual feedback, each with its own errors and delays that can potentially cause challenges in a human-robot system. Given these problems, how does one guarantee safe, collaborative and useful physical interaction between robots and humans? To date, no existing systems provide the user with an ideal experience of physically interacting with a robot. Device design and control are essential to the operation of all medical and health robots, since they interact physically with their environment.\nAccordingly, one of the most important technical challenges is in the area of mechanisms. Miniaturization is challenging in large part because current electromechanical actuators (the standard because of their desirable controllability and power to weight ratio) are relatively large. Biological analogs (e.g., human muscles) are far superior to engineered systems in terms of compactness, energy efficiency, low impedance, and high force output. Interestingly, these biological systems often combine mechanisms and actuation into an integrated, inseparable system. Goals for systems that achieve high dexterity at any scale will naturally differ greatly depending on the medical application (e.g. surgery, rehabilitation, and prosthetics).\nWe are focusing on truly innovative technology that is in line with current applications, but delivers an innovative approach. We are integrating image-guidance with navigation, AI, and organ-targeting to bring a system that is truly diverse and multi-dimensional. Having identified limitations in the predominantly non-autonomous robotic systems, we propose a disruptive model, which considers design and development through a seamless collaboration of the surgeon, the engineer and the scientist.\nThe core of the design and engineering of our medical robotic system is the AI-driven robotic arm navigation and guidance software which permits the system to autonomously guide a medical, surgical grade robotic arm and end-effector for safer and more effective treatment of patients. Our initial medical robotic system is designed to perform minimally invasive, surgical facial corrections using a micro-needling device for skin resurfacing. We plan to quickly follow this up with a laser end-effector, a tool useable for various skin resurfacing procedures. This modular approach should allow us to quickly adopt future technologies and instruments with only minor adaptations to the end-effectors and surgical tools approved for use.\nThe key technology in our system is the Avra Intelligent Instrument Guidance Software (AIIGS), an image-guided robotic guidance system that receives real-time 3D images, live sensor inputs from various subsystems to calculate precise orientation of the arm and end-effector over the patient in real-time during a procedure, ultimately allowing precision delivery of treatment to any area of the human body that is beyond the capabilities of a human being, and which should allow for more optimal and consistent treatments. The various image capture and sensor subsystems are outlined below and include, 2D image capture, 3D image capture and tracking, distance sensors, and touch sensors. We expect the AIIGS capability should then be relatively easily employed to support other surgical procedures beyond skin resurfacing, such as skin and wound care, drug delivery, tattoo removal, cellulite reduction, biopsies and Mohs surgery, to name a few.\nIn the case of facial micro-needling, through our proprietary intuitive graphic user interface, the doctor will be able to acquire a high-resolution depth map of the patients face and superimpose a trajectory map over Aesthetic Regions-of-Interest (AROIs). The doctor would then accept the suggested treatment protocol or assign specific micro-needling parameters to each AROI. AIIGS will autonomously control the arm and end-effector to follow a predetermined path based on the doctors specified parameters for each AROI, and continuously calculate the current and desired position over the sequential AROIs to ensure the precise treatment parameters are met. It will also reorient the end-effector so it is perpendicular to each AROI to ensure optimal application of micro-needling injection, and with the precise pressure needed, accounting for patient movement in real-time.\nOur medical robotic subsystems modules are outlined below. Areas of continuous development work include AI, DL, and medical robotic safety guidelines.\nWhile we plan to continue to develop our own custom robotic arm we are using an existing robotic arm that has been specifically developed under medical device standards and that meets all of our requirements for a robotic arm. The robot is classified as a lightweight robot and is a jointed-arm robot with seven axes. All drive units and current-carrying cables are routed inside the robot. Every axis contains multiple sensors that provide signals for robot control (e.g. position control and impedance control) and that are also used as a protective function for the robot. Every axis is monitored by sensors: axis range sensors ensure that the permissible axis range is adhered to, torque sensors ensure that the permissible axis loads are not exceeded, and temperature sensors monitor the thermal limit values of the electronics.\nOur medical robotic system requires high levels of accuracy and repeatability. Repeatability is a measure of the ability of the robot to consistently reach a specified point in 3D space (X, Y, Z). Accuracy is a measure of the distance error between the commanded point and the achieved point. Accuracy can be improved with external sensing, for example proximity, vision system or infra-red.\nFor skin resurfacing, technological improvements in motors, materials and in high resolution imaging allow for the use of robotic devices to assist the surgeon to autonomously treat damaged skin. Presently, we are not aware of any commercially available robotic devices designed for this application.\nApplication of Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, refers to software technologies that make a robot or computer act and think like a human. Some software engineers state that it is only artificial intelligence if it performs as well or better than a human. In this context, when we talk about performance, we mean human computational accuracy, speed, and capacity.\nArtificial intelligence includes the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Speech recognition, decision-making, visual perception, for example, are features of human intelligence that artificial intelligence may possess. Translation between languages is another feature.\nHumans can learn as we go along. In other words, learn from experience. Machines with AI can also do this, which we call machine learning. A neural network is an example of machine learning.\nA broad definition of a Deep Learning (DL) solution is the implementation of algorithms and techniques that endow machines with the ability to autonomously acquire the skills for executing complex tasks effectively letting robots acquire their own skills over time.\nThe term learning can be equated to an optimization process. Optimizing an objective that reflects the actual fitness of the behavior at accomplishing a specific task, such as a robot learning optimal trajectory, where the objective is to traverse a predetermined trajectory in a timely, safe and efficient manner. Telling our AIIGS system to find the optimal trajectory is a very high-level objective. This cannot be implemented with simple, static equations that control the robotic arm and end-effector, but with a reinforcement-learning algorithm we can discover the behavioral skills that optimize the goal. We will need to choose a representation for a behavioral skill.\nA representation could be a trajectory, a sequence of points, a motion. The robot could traverse to a specific point, but will do so from its current pose. What if you ask it to go to the same point from a different starting pose? The same sequence will not work. It needs to be more flexible to control a more complex movement. This could be in the form of a feedback controller where it looks at the state, applies a function and outputs the action. The more flexible the representation, the greater number of skills can be learned as it relates to a real-world environment.\nOne choice for a general, flexible representation is a Large Neural Network (LNN) that can represent any function; therefore, they can represent any motor skill. It needs more prior knowledge in order to learn. This is where sensor feedback is used and integrated. These can be cameras, tactile sensors, joint encoders that feed into the LNN, reducing the need to engineer specific perceptions and actions for any input modality.\nFor non-embodied systems such as image processing and speech processing, machine learning has been used and is very successful. This is primarily due to having good supervision. Learning is very successful when you know what the output should be for a given input.\nDeep Learning is a typical machine learning method which we intend to use extensively for the perception and intelligent control of our medical robotic system. We intend to apply a DL approach to detect and recognize facial features and use this information to optimally map, code and plan a trajectory over the individual AROIs virtually superimposed over a patients face. This is accomplished through feature learning. In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms in pattern recognition, classification and regression.\nDL is typically classified into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.\n\u25cf Supervised learning, the most common form of machine learning, where the error is measured between the actual and desired output and assigned a cost function with the goal being to minimize the cost. Supervised learning can be directly applied to the trajectory the arm and end-effector follows to arrive at a specific AROI. Accumulated data will be analyzed and used in future path trajectories.\n\u25cf Unsupervised learning does not assign a cost function, but instead aims to find the hidden patterns, structures or features embedded in the collected data. Unsupervised learning can be applied to the specific sequence of movements the arm and end-effector traverses to arrive at a specific AROI at the proper orientation and at the proper pressure. This varies with each patients skin type as well as the curvature and location on the face. For example, prior to firing the needles the micro-needling instrument must approach at a perpendicular angle to the specific AROI and make even and consistent contact with the patients skin. Our AIIGS will accumulate this information and apply it to future procedures.\n\u25cf In reinforcement learning, a software agent is defined to explore and exploit the space of possible strategies. Feedback in the form of reward or cost from the dynamic environment is referred as the outcome of the chosen action.\nWith our medical robotic system, some examples of functionality where DL will be employed are:\n\u25cf optimal trajectory of the arm and end-effector based on the size and shape of the patients head and face;\n\u25cf optimal arm manipulation as it traverses the trajectory;\n\u25cf efficient and safe arm movements;\n\u25cf optimal approach attitude of the micro-needling instrument as it approaches various topographical sections of the patients face; and\n\u25cf optimal treatment protocols such as depth, energy, time for micro-needling for specific skin types and for each AROI.\nProduct Description\nThere are five key elements to our medical robotic system, all of which can potentially generate revenues:\n\u25cf Robotic Systems: Standardized robotic arms, precision guidance system, and software controls designed to the needs of doctors and physicians. This includes elements of AI, DL and related algorithms which may have applications to other fields of work beyond medical and may be licensed out in the future.\n\u25cf Robotic Tools: Standardized tools that can be modified to cover a wide range of medical procedures. Avra plans to sell its robotic systems while obtaining recurring revenues and high gross margins from its tools, which will need to be replaced, just as they are in the handheld versions, for each individual procedure.\n\u25cf Maintenance: Service contracts supporting ongoing operation and simplified so that much of the support can be performed remotely.\n\u25cf Education and Training: Remote and on-site training programs for surgeons, aestheticians, hospitals and medical support staff.\n\u25cf Software: Updates to both the software and algorithms.\nRegulatory Strategy\nOur products and operations will be subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. by the FDA and by similar agencies in other countries or regions in which we may market our medical robotic systems. In order to smooth our market entry a comprehensive regulatory strategy has been devised where we create robust preclinical and clinical data supporting our products claims and proving the Avra Medical Robotic Arm is safe and will perform as intended. We plan to employ four tiers of tightly interrelated activities. The specific undertaking in each of the tiers will be coordinated in advance with each regulatory jurisdiction where we intend to offer the product line for sale (the U.S., Canada, the European Union, Brazil, Japan and Australia). The four tiers are:\n1. Preclinical testing of the system (the controller, the computer, the arm and the end-effector.) Preclinical testing encompasses testing without using the device on human subjects. Key facets of preclinical testing are electrical safety, EMC and EMI testing; integration testing of the system elements and the development of a clinical training program.\n2. Software involves all elements of the arms operations. The documentation required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness is comprehensive. Each task within a process is mapped and controlled. A risk matrix is established to guide the software development and also to play the pivotal role in verification, validation and testing.\n3. Proof of concept testing follows preclinical and software. In proof of concept we demonstrate the arm and its end-effector operation and that even someone with little robotic experience can successfully use the arm within the indications for use and for the purposes intended. A three-stage demonstration will be undertaken first on animals of various sizes and weights; then on human cadavers of various sizes and weights and finally on a small cohort of human subjects. Each stage must be successfully completed before the next stage is undertaken. The final stage (human proof of concept testing) will be under the supervision of an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or similar ethics committee.\n4. The strength of our testing to date has two aims - address all aspects of risk and second to minimize the size and expense of a human clinical trial. It is our belief that any remaining element of risk or uncertainty will only require a small sample size (50 or less). Regardless of the sample size the human clinical trial shall have a performance endpoint and a safety endpoint that will serve as milestones to measure the outcome.\nTo support our ongoing compliance the company plans to become registered to the requirements of EN ISO 13485, the U.S.FDA QSR, ANVISA from Brazil, TGA from Australia, Health Canada, Japanese MHLW and CE Marking under new Medical Device Regulations. To achieve this with minimal expense, we plan to use a Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) Auditing Organization that is also a European Notified Body.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that we intend to market in the U.S. must first receive either 510(k) clearance or Premarket (PMA) approval from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The FDAs 510(k) clearance process usually takes from four to 12 months, but it can last longer. The process of obtaining PMA approval can be more costly, lengthy and uncertain. It generally takes from one to three years or even longer.\nThe FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the agency perceives is associated with the device and a determination whether the product is similar to devices that are already legally marketed. Devices deemed to pose relatively less risk are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to request 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The manufacturer must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use, safety and effectiveness to a legally marketed predicate device that is either in class I, class II, or is a pre-amendment class III device, one that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for submission of a PMA application. After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification to the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or could require a PMA approval.\nDevices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed predicate device, are placed in class III. Such devices are required to undergo the PMA approval process in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDAs satisfaction.\nPMA application must provide preclinical and clinical trial data as well as information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with cGMP and QSR requirements, which include elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures. During the FDAs review, an FDA advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, likely will be convened to review the application and recommend to the FDA whether, or upon what conditions, the device should be approved. Although the FDA is not bound by the advisory panel decision, the panels recommendation is important to the FDAs overall decision-making process. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to comply with specific conditions or to supply specific additional data or information in order to secure final PMA approval.\nOnce the approvable letter conditions are satisfied, the FDA will issue a PMA order for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the manufacturer. The PMA order can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in an enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of modifications to the device, its labeling or its manufacturing process.\nA clinical trial may be required to support a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. Such trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites, unless the product is deemed an insignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. Clinical trials may begin if the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites approve the IDE. Trials must be conducted in conformance with FDA regulations and institutional review board requirements.\nIn order for us to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with safety and quality regulations in those countries. These regulations, including the requirements for approval or clearance and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country.\nTo expedite securing approvals to market, we initially retained the services of HPG, a consulting firm experienced in securing U.S. and foreign approvals to market medical devices. HPG prepared and filed an application with the FDA for our initial medical robotic system and participated in the initial pre-collaboration meeting with the FDA in August 2019. This is the first of a series of meetings where the Avra system and its regulatory requirements will be discussed in ever-increasing specificity. We believe that this should allow us to closely focus on only the meaningful activities saving both resources and time. The robotic arm we will utilize for our system has already been approved in the EU and received a CE mark. The Company has begun implementing a quality and regulatory system that will serve as the foundation for U.S., Canadian, European, Australian, Japanese, and Brazilian market access for our medical robotic system. The Medical Device Single Audit Program, which we are employing, is a single inspection that, when completed, is expected to support market access to these six most important medical device marketplaces.\nOur regulatory strategy has been designed so that once the first treatment is approved then following treatments, such as those using lasers, should enjoy a much quicker time to approval. Our expected timeline may change depending on available resources and FDA response times.\nWe plan to be registered via the MDSAP in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, Australian TGA, MHLW Japan, ANVISA of Brazil and the EU Medical Device Regulation, and plan to have completed integration testing for the system (controller, computer, arm, cabling, end-effector and the software) for at least two medical systems within two years of receipt of required funding.\nDepending upon the terms of our agreement with the FDA on the need for and depth of proof of concept and clinical trial testing we believe that we should have completed the proof of concept and human clinical trial portion within one year of our agreement with them. We would then hold market clearances for our robotic system from the U.S. FDA, Health Canada, and CE Marking under the European Medical Directive. At around the same time, we believe that we will have made substantial progress toward market clearances in Australia, Japan and Brazil.\nManufacturing and Sources of Supply\nWe plan to initially assemble our systems in our own facilities and will only begin using contract manufacturers when the volume of systems being sold becomes sufficiently large to justify outsourcing. Most of the components used in our initial medical robotic system consist of existing hardware technologies relatively easily available from multiple sources. We will then make any required modifications to allow them to be assembled on site. Recent advances in such manufacturing techniques as 3D printing should allow us to do so relatively quickly. The software integration into our initial medical robotic system, calibration and testing is expected to be done on site as well. We have already identified potential manufacturers for the modified end-effectors, such as the microneedling tool, and other components we will integrate into the system.\nIntellectual Property\nOur proprietary software and algorithms are expected to be one of the greatest value drivers for the Company. The software and AI links all our robotic systems various sensors, systems and tools and allows them to work seamlessly together to complete procedures autonomously given the treatment parameters provided by the operator.\nTo date, we have submitted six provisional patents which, upon further review internally with our IP counsel, were subsequently combined into one (1) international utility patent application. This consolidation brought together the various parts of our AIIGS. In addition, it included broad device claims involving the combination of a navigation system, sensors, a variety of end-effectors, and the robotic arm. The national stages of the international patent application were then submitted in the U.S. in July 2018 and in Brazil in December 2018. In April 2018, we also submitted a U.S. design patent application, specifically applied to the robotic arm segment housing. This design patent application was subsequently filed in Canada in October 2019.\nWe intend to continue filing, as necessary, patent applications in the U.S., as well as in other jurisdictions where we intend to market our products and where the dates of our initial patent applications will give us a right of priority.\nWe also expect to accumulate a tremendous amount of data as needed for its AI and DL systems. This should result in continuous improvements in patient outcomes. This proprietary data should not only be of value to Avra, but may also be of value to third parties in the aesthetics world.\nResearch Partnership with UCF\nEffective as of May 2016, we entered into a Research Agreement with UCF (the Research Agreement) establishing a research partnership for the development of a prototype surgical robotic device supporting minimal invasive surgical facial corrections. Pursuant to the Research Agreement, UCF provided personnel for the development of prototype navigation and control software for the robotic medical device and the integration of all the necessary subcomponents. UCF engineering doctoral students under the direction of Professor of Electrical Engineering Zhihua Qu assisted Avra with its research and development efforts in autonomous medical robotics pursuant to the Research Agreement, which was extended several times and finally expired in April 2021. We provided funding of $163,307 for the project, which was supplemented by a $68,952 matching funds grant from the Florida High Tech Corridor Council. In addition, Avra paid UCF $43,548 for outright ownership of work developed by UCF in the collaboration.\nCompetition\nThe development and commercialization of medical devices is highly competitive. We will compete with a variety of multinational companies and specialized medical device companies, as well as technology being developed at universities and other research institutions.\nAs our technology would replace current handheld solutions, our natural competition would be existing manufacturers of those handheld devices such as Hologics Cynosure, Syneron Medical, and Lumenis. The current aesthetics device market is fragmented with no single company dominating the sector, particularly in the laser and micro-needling segments. Based on our research and communications with the FDA, we are not currently aware of any companies developing an autonomous robotic approach to aesthetics procedures.\nAs our strategy includes building a robotic platform system that would work with any handheld device, we are not tied to any particular treatment or device and could potentially partner with manufacturers of any particular end-effector technology versus competing with them. This strategy also ensures that our aesthetics solutions never become outdated as we would only need to adapt emerging end-effector instrumentation and technology to our robotic system.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this report the Company has four full-time and six part-time employees, including certain executive officers. We also rely on independent third-party consultants to perform additional services as needed. As we implement our business plan and subject to the availability of capital, additional employees will be hired to meet the needs of our growth. We currently have agreements with several individuals, particularly in the software, artificial intelligence and engineering disciplines, who are currently working on a part-time basis, but will become full-time Avra employees upon financing. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nAs a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1924, as amended (the Exchange Act), we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNot applicable. Item 2.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nCurrently there are no legal proceedings pending or threatened against us. However, from time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in any such matter may harm our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nFrom July 2018 through September 2018, our common stock traded on the OTCPink tier of the over-the counter market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. From September 2018 until September 2020, our common stock traded on the OTCQB tier of the over-the-counter market and from September 2020 until September 2021, our common stock again traded on the OTCPink tier of the over-the-counter market. As a result of the death of the principal of our independent registered public accounting firm in December 2019 and the subsequent cessation of that firms operations, we temporarily ceased filing our periodic reports under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, commencing September 28, 2021, our common stock commenced trading on the Expert Market. The filing of this report is part of our efforts to become current in our Exchange Act filings and have our common stock traded on the OTCPink or OTCQB tiers of the over-the counter market, although there is no assurance that we will be able to do so.\nThe trading symbol for our common stock is AVMR. Regardless of which market our common stock has traded on, the trading market for our common stock has been sporadic and extremely limited. There can be no assurance that a liquid public trading market for our shares will develop or if developed, that it will be sustained\nHolders of our Common Stock\nAs of November 1, 2022, we had 39,197,099 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and 181 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nThe payment by us of dividends, if any, in the future rests within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. We have not paid any dividends since our inception and we do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, but intend to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nPlan category Number of\nsecurities to\nbe issued upon\nexercise\nof outstanding\noptions,\nwarrants and\nrights Weighted-\naverage\nexercise\nprice of outstanding\noptions,\nwarrants and\nrights Number of\nsecurities\nremaining\navailable for future\nissuance\nunder equity\ncompensation\nplans(excluding\nsecurities\nreflected in column\n(a))\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders 5,116,000 shares (1) $ 0.528 4,074,000 shares (1)\nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders 0 shares -- 0 shares\nTotal 5,116,000 shares (1) $ 0.528 4,074,000 shares (1)\n(1) Represents shares of common stock under our 2016 Incentive Stock Plan.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company issued and sold the following shares of our common stock without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act):\nOn October 26, 2020, AVRA issued an aggregate 256,027 Units (Units) at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the Offering) to four accredited investors. Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock (Shares); (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share; and (c) a put option of their Membership Units in Avra Air LLC for one share of our common stock. As a result of the foregoing, the investors were issued an aggregate of 1,024,108 Shares, warrants to purchase 1,280,135 Shares and put options for 256,027 Shares. One of the accredited investors, per his original commitment, subsequently invested an additional $45,000 on May 3, 2021 in this same Unit funding thus receiving an additional 180,000 Shares, a warrant to purchase 225,000 Shares and a put option for 45,000 Shares.\nOn December 22, 2020 one accredited investor and the CEO invested $25,000 and $202,700, respectively, into 227,700 Units at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the Offering). Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock; and (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. As a result of the foregoing, they were issued an aggregate of 910,800 Shares, and warrants to purchase 1,138,500 shares. The CEO used a total of $202,700 of Notes due to him from the Company to purchase these Units.\nOn November 6, 2020, AVRA made an investment of $210,000 in Avra Air which was made with $40,000 in cash and the balance by the issuance to Avra Air of 472,222 restricted shares of our common stock valued at $0.36 per share.\nOn October 27, 2020, one investor paid $2,100 to the Company to exercise his option to purchase 21,000 shares at $0.10 per share.\nOn November 6, 2020 6 consultants were issued a total 60,489 restricted shares of our common stock per their service agreements.\nOn November 6, 2020 Director Ettore Tomassetti was issued 10,000 restricted shares of our common stock per his Stock Grant dated April 15, 2019.\nOn November 6, 2020 our Chief Strategy Officer was issued 160,000 restricted shares of our common stock per his employment agreement dated March 1, 2018 and his Stock Grant Award dated April 15, 2019.\nOn November 6, 2020 our Chief Medical Officer was issued 70,000 restricted shares of our common stock per his employment agreement dated September 15, 2017.\nOn October 1, 2021, the Companys CEO, converted a total of $595,000 of accrued salary into 5,950,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per share and agreed to receive 450,000 shares of common stock for $45,000 of the remaining salary due for the three months ending December 31, 2021at a price of $0.10 per share.\nOn October 1, 2021, a former employee now a consultant elected to convert a total of $251,500 of accrued consulting fees into 2,515,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per share, converted $161,500 of accrued salary into 1,615,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per share. and $4,500 of expenses into 45,000 shares of common stock at a price of $0.10 per share.\nAll the above securities were issued pursuant to the exemptions from registration under the Securities Act afforded by Section 4(a)(2) thereof and/or Regulation D thereunder. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nResults of Operations\nIntroduction\nThe financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company was recently formed and has not established sufficient operations or revenues to sustain the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe following table provides selected financial data about our Company at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019:\nBalance Sheet Data As of As of\nDecember 31, December 31,\nCash $ 405,774 $ 160,709\nTotal Assets $ 428,607 $ 317,870\nTotal Liabilities $ 287,281 $ 1,186,919\nTotal Stockholders Deficit $ 141,326 $ (869,049 )\nTo date, the Company has relied on debt and equity raised in private offerings to finance operations and no other source of capital has been identified or sought. If we experience a shortfall in operating capital we could be faced with having to limit our research and development and marketing activities.\nYear ended December 31, 2021, as compared to year ended December 31, 2020\nRevenues. We had no revenues during the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses during year ended December 31, 2021 were $1,000, as compared to $3,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Research and development expenses reflect continuing development work on the Companys prototype robotic system at its facilities at UCFs incubator in Orlando, Florida.\nCompensation Expense. We had compensation expense of $947,237 and $812,190 during year ended 2021 and 2020 respectively. This includes compensation for the management staff and stock-based compensation expense related to the Companys 2016 Stock Incentive Plan.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. We incurred $458,801 in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to $287,737 for the year ended December 31, 2020. General and administrative expenses include legal and other professional expenses related to the Companys filings as a public company with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC).\nOther Income (Expenses). We have earned $118 during year ended 2021 as compared to a net negative of $(21,754) during 2020. The net negative number for 2020 is primarily attributable to investment loss, offset in part by forgiveness of a PPP loan.\nNet Loss. We incurred a net loss of $(1,484,313) for 2021 as compared to a net loss of $(1,124,681) for 2020. The increase in net loss from 2021 to 2020 is primarily a result of the increase in General and administrative expenses and compensation expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Company expects to require substantial funds for research and development, to continue to develop its initial proposed medical robotic system. The Company plans to meet its operating cash flow requirements by raising additional funds from the sale of our securities and, if possible, on favorable terms, by entering into development partnerships to assist the Company with its technology development activities.\nDuring the period from inception (February 4, 2015) through December 31, 2019, the Company raised (a) $1,900 from an initial private offering of its common stock in February 2017; (b) $480,000 from the private offering of the convertible notes completed in June 2017; (c) $135,000 from a private offering of 135,000 shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share completed in February 2017; (d) $542,260 from a private offering of 433,808 shares of stock in a private offering at a price of $1.25 per share completed in September 2017; and (e) $20,000 from the private sale of 16,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.25 per share in August 2018.\nIn March 2019, the Company sold 7.5 Units in a private offering of ten (10) units (Units), each Unit consisting of a $10,000 principal amount six-month promissory note bearing interest at the rate of 5% per annum and a three-year warrant to purchase 5,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.25 per share.\nIn addition to the foregoing, from December 2018 thru October 2020, the Company obtained sixteen loans from Barry F. Cohen, our Chief Executive Officer totaling $497,700. The loans were due 12 months from funding date and did not bear interest. With the exception of two loans totaling $145,000, all of these loans were subsequently repaid in full via conversions into restricted company shares or Units including one loan for $100,000 which was used to exercise a stock option for 1,000,000 shares held by Mr. Cohen.\nOn October 26, 2020, AVRA issued an aggregate 256,027 Units (Units) at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the Offering) to four accredited investors. Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock (Shares); (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share; and (c) a put option of their Membership Units in Avra Air LLC for one share of our common stock. As a result of the foregoing, the investors were issued an aggregate of 1,024,108 Shares, warrants to purchase 1,280,135 Shares and put options for 256,027 Shares.\nOn December 22, 2020 one accredited investor and the CEO invested $25,000 and $202,700, respectively, into 227,700 Units at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the Offering). Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock; and (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share. As a result of the foregoing, they were issued an aggregate of 910,800 Shares, and warrants to purchase 1,138,500 Shares. The CEO used a total of $202,700 of Notes due to him from the Company to purchase these Units.\nOn February 10, 2020, AVRA issued an aggregate 235,000 Units (Units) at a price of $1.00 per Unit in a private offering (the Offering) to four accredited investors. Each Unit consisted of (a) four shares of our common stock (Shares); (b) a three-year warrant to purchase five Shares at an exercise price of $0.40 per Share. As a result of the foregoing, the investors were issued an aggregate of 940,000 Shares.\nBetween October 5, 2021 and December 8, 2021 the Company sold a total of 2,229,231 shares of common stock at prices ranging between $0.13 and $0.52 per share. The Company received proceeds of $315,200.\nWhile we have been successful in raising funds to fund our operations since inception and we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations going forward, we do not have any committed sources of funding and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, if the efforts noted above are not successful, it would raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. If we cannot obtain financing, then we may be forced to further curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives. Even if we are successful in raising the additional financing, there is no assurance regarding the terms of any additional investment and any such investment or other strategic alternative would likely substantially dilute our current shareholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates included deferred revenue, costs incurred related to deferred revenue, the useful lives of property and equipment and the useful lives of intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes, as clarified by ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws. Deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year. In providing for deferred taxes, the Company considers tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, estimates of future taxable income, and available tax planning strategies. If tax regulations, operating results or the ability to implement tax-planning strategies vary, adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required. Valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of ASC 740.\nASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThere are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\n(a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagements Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as our principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2020, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, as our principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, has concluded that as of December 20, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described in Item 9A(b) of this report.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as our principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n(b) Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of our company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of our Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), as amended, as of December 31, 2020, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms adopted by the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, has concluded that as of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level reasonable assurance level in that:\n\u25cf We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\n\u25cf We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness.\nOur Chief Executive Officer, as our Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officer has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n(c) Remediation of Material Weaknesses\nTo remediate the material weakness in our documentation, evaluation and testing of internal controls we plan to engage a third-party firm to assist us in remedying this material weakness once resources become available.\nWe also intend to remedy our material weakness with regard to insufficient segregation of duties by hiring additional employees in order to segregate duties in a manner that establishes effective internal controls once resources become available.\n(d) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/S/ BF Borgers CPA PC\nBF Borgers CPA PC\nPCAOB ID 5041\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since\nLakewood, CO\nOctober 31, 2022\nAVRA MEDICAL ROBOTICS, INC.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 405,774 $ 160,709\nOther prepaid expenses and deposit $ 2,291 $ 2,290\nTotal Current Assets 408,065 $ 162,999\nEQUIPMENT: $\nEquipment 98,592 $ 98,592\nAccumulated depreciation $ (78,050 ) $ (60,385 )\nTotal Equipment, net 20,542 $ 38,207\nINVESTMENT: Investment in Avra Air LLC -

The Company is a development-stage enterprise devoting substantial efforts to establishing a new business, financial planning, raising capital, and research into products which may become part of the Companys product portfolio. The Company has not realized sales through December 31, 2020. A development stage company is defined as one in which all efforts are devoted substantially to establishing a new business and, even if planned principal operations have commenced, revenues are insignificant.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the continuation of the Company as a going concern. At December 31, 2021, the Companys stockholders deficit was $8,400,668 which raises substantial doubt about the Company. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and is dependent on debt and equity financing to fund its operations. Management of the Company is making efforts to raise additional funding until a registration statement relating to an equity funding facility is in effect. While management of the Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation and planned operating activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital, or be successful in the development and commercialization of the products it develops or initiates collaboration agreements thereon. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nEstimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all cash on hand, cash accounts not subject to withdrawal restrictions or penalties, and all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash. The Company maintains its principal cash balance in a financial institution. These balances are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $147,460 and $0, respectively, were in excess of the FDIC insured limit.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU and all subsequently issued clarifying ASUs replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. The ASU also required expanded disclosures relating to the nature amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The Company adopted the new standard effective January 1, 2018, the first day of the Companys fiscal year. For these reasons, the adoption of this ASU did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements\nEffective January 1, 2018, the Company adopted guidance issued by the FASB regarding recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The revenue recognition policies as enumerated below reflect the Company's accounting policies effective January 1, 2018, which did not have a materially different financial statement result than what the results would have been under the previous accounting policies for revenue recognition.\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies the following five steps in order to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized as it fulfills its obligations under each of its agreements:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with customers\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to performance obligations\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when the entity satisfies a performance obligation\nAs the Company had no business operations during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we have not identified specific planned revenue streams.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not recognize any revenue.\nEquipment\nEquipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method at rates determined to estimate the useful lives of the assets. The annual rates used in calculating depreciation are as follows:\nEquipment -5 years straight-line\nThe Company originally purchased medical equipment for a total cost of $75,000 which was 100% financed by the seller. After making several payments, the Company settled with the vendor due to issues with equipment, and was relieved of the $25,000 balance owed as of first quarter 2020. The total amount paid of $50,000 represents the actual cost. During the year 2021, there is no addition.\nIntangibles\nIntangible assets continue to be subject to amortization, and any impairment is determined in accordance with ASC 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, intangible assets are stated at historical cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives. The Company uses a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined\nThe Company purchased existing Intellectual Property from the University of Central Florida. Management regularly assesses the carrying value of the intellectual property to determine if there has been any diminution of value.\nWebsite\nWebsite is recorded at cost and it has been fully amortized during the year. The Company originally designed a website in February 2018 for a total cost of $36,000 out of which $14,400 was paid via bank transfer and the balance was paid by issuing 24,000 shares. In 2019, the company incurred a small expense of $121.93 which was paid via bank transfer. $36,000 has been amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated life of 3 years, and $121.93 is amortized in this year.\nLong-lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 360, Property Plant and Equipment, the Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to : significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset and current expectation that the asset will more than likely not be sold or disposed significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the discounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain circumstances. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value.\nStock Compensation Expense\nThe Company accounts for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 505, \"Equity.\" Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earlier of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by ASC Topic 505.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to ASC Topic 740 \"Income Taxes.\" Under ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the bases of certain assets and liabilities for income tax and financial reporting purposes. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified according to the financial statement classification of the assets and liabilities generating the differences. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 740-10-05 \"Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.\" The ASC clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. The ASC prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The ASC provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition.\nBasic and Diluted Loss per Share\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 260 \"Earnings Per Share,\" basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share gives effect to dilutive convertible securities, options, warrants and other potential common stock outstanding during the period, only in periods in which such effect is dilutive. The Company only has stock options and convertible promissory notes that may be converted to outstanding potential common shares.\nResearch and Development Costs\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 730 \"Research and Development\", with the exception of intellectual property that is purchased from another enterprise and have alternative future use, research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist principally of accounts receivable, amounts due to related parties and promissory notes payable. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents and promissory notes approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCompensation- Stock Compensation\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, that provides guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The new guidance became effective for the Company on January 1, 2018 and was applied on a prospective basis, as required. The adoption of this standard did not have an impact on the financial statements or the related disclosures.\nLeases\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (ASU 2016-02). The FASB issued ASU 2016-02 to increase transparency and comparability among organizations recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Under ASU 2016-02, lessors will account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. Unlike current guidance, however, a lease with collectability uncertainties may be classified as a sales-type lease. If collectability of lease payments, plus any amount necessary to satisfy a lessee residual value guarantee, is not probable, lease payments received will be recognized as a deposit liability and the underlying assets will not be derecognized until collectability of the remaining amounts becomes probable. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted, and must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition. The Company did not adopt the standard effective January 1, 2019, utilizing the lessor practical expedient. On November 15, 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10 which amended the effective dates for ASC 842, to give implementation relief. Under the FASB's new framework, two \"buckets\" were defined, bucket 1 includes public companies that are SEC filers but excludes \"Small Reporting Companies\" (SRC's). Bucket 2 includes all other entities, including SRC's. Bucket 2 entities have to apply ASC 842 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021.\nNOTE 3 - INVESTMENT\nOn November 6, 2020, AVRA made an investment (the Investment) of $210,000 in Avra Air, LLC which was made with $40,000 in cash and the balance by the issuance to Avra Air, LLC of 472,222 restricted common shares of AVRA valued at $0.36 per Share. In exchange for the Investment AVRA received (a) a 49.8% limited liability company membership interest in Avra Air, LLC; and (b) the remaining 50% of a vehicular air sterilization provisional patent that AVRA did not yet control. In addition, AVRA agreed to pay Avra Air, LLC a royalty payment of $1.50 per vehicular air sterilization kit for two years from the date that a first kit that uses the patent is sold. On December 22, 2020, the Company issued 472,222 shares of its common stock towards its acquisition of Avra Air. LLC.\nInvestment in Avra Air- LLC was reduced by $12,150 in the second quarter of 2021 as a result of an investors follow-on investment. An impairment charge of $77,392 was then taken in the last quarter of 2021. As the $26,000 remaining balance was paid for in the original investment using Avra Medical shares this remaining balance is considered a buy-back of Avra Medical common shares and are thus treated as treasury shares shown in the equity section of the balance sheet. This results in a $0 cost on the books for this investment.\nNOTE 4 - NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY\nOn December 31, 2018, the Company borrowed $15,000 under a non-interest bearing promissory note from a related party.

In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally.\nThe full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve as of the date of this report.
