    "content": "Item 1 - Business\nPrimary Operating Divisions and Facilities and Industry Segments\nChase Corporation (the Company, Chase, we, or us), a global specialty chemicals company founded in 1946, is a leading manufacturer of protective materials for high-reliability applications across diverse market sectors. Our strategy is to maximize the performance of our core businesses and brands while seeking future opportunities through strategic acquisitions. Through investments in facilities, systems and organizational consolidation we seek to improve performance and gain economies of scale.\nWe are organized into three reportable operating segments: an Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, an Industrial Tapes segment and a Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets.\nThe Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are generally used in, or integrated into, another companys product. Demand for the segments product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company and serves diverse markets and applications. The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliances, medical, personal care, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The segments products include moisture protective coatings and cleaners, and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics, polymeric microspheres, polyurethane dispersions, specialty polymers and superabsorbent polymers. Beginning September 1, 2022 (first day of fiscal 2023), the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment includes the acquired operations of NuCera Solutions (NuCera), within the functional additives product line.\nThe Industrial Tapes segment features wire and cable materials, specialty tapes and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, its diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Industrial Tapes segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The segments offerings include insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers, laminated durable papers, laminates for the packaging and industrial laminate markets, custom manufacturing services, pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cables and water and natural gas lines and cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape-and-reel packaging.\nThe Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as Chase branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segments products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets.

See Note 14 - Acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProducts and Markets\nOur principal products are specialty tapes, laminates, adhesives, sealants, coatings and chemical intermediates which are sold by our salespeople, manufacturers' representatives and distributors.\nIn our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment, these products consist of:\n(i) moisture protective coatings and cleaning solutions, which are sold to the electronics industry for circuitry manufacturing, including circuitry used in automobiles, industrial controls and home appliances;\n(ii) advanced adhesives, sealants, and coatings for automotive and industrial applications that require specialized bonding, encapsulating, environmental protection, or thermal management functionality;\n(iii) polymeric microspheres utilized by various industries to allow for weight and density reduction and sound dampening;\n(iv) polyurethane dispersions utilized for various coating products;\n(v) superabsorbent polymers utilized for water and liquid management, remediation and protection in diverse markets including wire and cable, medical, environmental, infrastructure, energy and consumer products; and\n(vi) highly differentiated polymers and polymerization technologies which are utilized in high-growth end markets such as personal care, polymer additives, coatings, diversified consumer products and masterbatches.\nIn our Industrial Tapes segment, these products consist of:\n(i) insulating and conducting materials for the manufacture of electrical and telephone wire and cable, electrical splicing, and terminating and repair tapes, which are marketed to wire and cable manufacturers;\n(ii) laminated film foils, including EMI/RFI shielding tapes used in communication and local area network (LAN) cable;\n(iii) industrial coated or laminate products and custom manufacturing services sold into medical, consumer, automotive, packaging, energy, telecommunications and other specialized markets;\n(iv) laminated durable papers, including laminated paper with an inner security barrier used in personal and mail-stream privacy protection, which are sold primarily to the envelope converting and commercial printing industries;\n(v) pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cable, water and natural gas lines, and power, data, and video cable for commercial buildings; and\n(vi) cover tapes with reliable adhesive and anti-static properties essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging.\nIn our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment, these products consist of:\n(i) protective coatings, tapes and protectants for pipelines, valves, casings and other metals, which are sold to oil companies, gas companies and water/wastewater utilities for use in both the construction and maintenance of oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines;\n(ii) fluid-applied coating and lining systems for use in the water and wastewater industry;\n(iii) waterproofing tapes and coatings used in waterproofing of the exterior of both commercial and industrial structures;\n(iv) waterproofing membranes for highway bridge deck metal-supported surfaces, and high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, which are sold to municipal transportation authorities; and\n(v) expansion and control joint systems designed for roads, bridges, stadiums and airport runways.\nThere is some seasonality in selling products into the construction market, which most acutely effects our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Higher demand is often experienced when temperatures are warmer in most of North America (April through October), with lower demand occurring when temperatures are colder (typically our second fiscal quarter).\nHuman Capital Management\nChase Corporations success derives from its dedicated employees worldwide, who are responsible for the operations, innovation and ethics core to our business and its future.\nAs of August 31, 2023, we employed approximately 859 people (including union employees). Of these, 82% were U.S. based and 18% international. 31% of our employees worked in administrative, selling and research and development functions, while 69% worked in the manufacture of our products at our facilities. Given macrotrends faced worldwide, Chase currently operates in an increasingly competitive landscape in hiring and retaining a manufacturing labor force. We consider our employee relations to be good. In the U.S., we offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits, which we believe are competitive relative to others in our industry. In our operations outside the U.S., we offer benefits that may vary from those offered to our U.S. employees due to customary local practices and statutory requirements.\nWe have policies in place designed to provide a safe and healthy workplace and comply with applicable safety and health regulations and our own internal requirements. We work to provide and maintain a safe, healthy and productive workplace, in consultation with our employees, by addressing and remediating identified risks of accidents, injury and health impacts.\nWe strive to maintain workplace environments that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, sex, color, national or social origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression, political opinion, or any other status protected by applicable law. The qualities and characteristics we seek for recruitment, hiring, placement, development, training, compensation, and advancement at the Company are job qualifications, performance, skills, and experience.\nRespect for human rights is a fundamental value of the Company. Chase strives to respect and promote human rights in accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights in our relationships with our employees, customers, suppliers, and vendors. Our aim is to further advance human rights within the communities in which we operate. The Chase Corporation Human Rights and Supplier Code of Conduct policies and statements on Safety Performance, Environmental Impact and Energy and Resources are available on our website (www.chasecorp.com).\nBacklog, Customers and Competition\nAs of August 31, 2023, the backlog of customer orders believed to be firm was approximately $42,920,000. This compared with a backlog of approximately $40,600,000 as of August 31, 2022. The increase in backlog from the prior year amount was primarily due to NuCera Solutions increasing the balance for the current year. We continue to work with our customers, vendors and supply chain partners to prioritize the flow of goods. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, no customer accounted for more than 10% of sales. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation or termination of profits or contracts at the election of the United States Federal Government.\nThere are other companies that manufacture or sell products and services similar to those made and sold by us. Many of those companies are larger and have greater financial resources than we have. We compete principally on the basis of technical performance, service reliability, quality and price.\nRaw Materials\nWe obtain raw materials from a wide variety of suppliers, with alternative sources of most essential materials available within reasonable lead times.\nPatents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions\nAs of August 31, 2023, we owned the following trademarks that we believe were of material importance to our business: Chase Corporation\u00ae, C-Spray (Logo), a trademark used in conjunction with most of the Companys business segment and product line marketing material and communications; HumiSeal\u00ae, a trademark for moisture protective coatings sold to the electronics industry; Chase & Sons\u00ae, a trademark for barrier and insulating tapes sold to the wire and cable industry; Chase BLH2OCK\u00ae, a trademark for a water-blocking compound sold to the wire and cable industry; Rosphalt50\u00ae, a trademark for an asphalt additive used predominantly on bridge decks for waterproofing protection; PaperTyger\u00ae, a trademark for laminated durable papers sold to the envelope converting and commercial printing industries; DuraDocument\u00ae, a trademark for durable, laminated papers sold to the digital print industry; Defender\u00ae a trademarked RFID protective material sold to the personal accessories and paper industries; Tapecoat\u00ae, a trademark for corrosion preventive surface coatings and primers; Maflowrap\u00ae, a trademark for anti-corrosive tapes incorporating self-adhesive mastic or rubber-backed strips, made of plastic materials; Royston\u00ae, a trademark for a corrosion-inhibiting coating composition for use on pipes; Ceva\u00ae, a trademark for epoxy pastes/gels/mortars and elastomeric concrete used in the construction industry; CIM\u00ae trademarks for fluid-applied coating and lining systems used in the water and wastewater industry; ServiWrap\u00ae trademarks for pipeline protection tapes, coatings and accessories; NEPTCO\u00ae, a trademark used in conjunction with most of NEPTCOs products marketing material and communications; NEPTAPE\u00ae, a trademark for coated shielding and insulation materials used in the wire and cable industry; Muletape\u00ae, a trademark for pulling and installation tapes sold to the telecommunications industry; Trace-Safe\u00ae, a trademark for detection tapes sold to the telecommunications and water and gas utilities industries; Dualite\u00ae, a trademark for polymeric microspheres utilized for density and weight reduction and sound dampening by various industries; 4EvaSeal\u00ae, a trademark for adhesive-backed tape utilized in various industries; Resin Designs\u00ae, a trademark for adhesives and sealants sold into the microelectronics and semiconductor industries; SlickTape\u00ae, a trademark for a lubricated shielding tape sold to the wire and cable industry; HighDraw\u00ae, a trademark for a highly extensible shielding tape sold to the wire and cable industry; ZapZorb\u00ae, a trademark for environmental solidification products that are designed to meet the specific challenges posed by a wide range of liquid-bearing waste streams; ZapLoc\u00ae, a trademark for medical waste solidifier products packaged in bottles or larger packages; ZapPak\u00ae, a trademark for medical waste solidifier products packaged in dissolvable film; and ABchimie\u00ae, a trademark used in conjunction with most of ABchimies products marketing material and communications.\nWe do not have any other material trademarks, licenses, franchises, or concessions.

Item 1A - Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We feel that any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or our future financial performance. While we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\nOperational and Competitive Risks\nWe currently operate in mature markets where increases or decreases in market share could be significant.\nOur sales and net income are largely dependent on sales from a consistent and well-established customer base. We have used and will continue to use strategic acquisitions as a means to build and grow the business. In this business environment, increases or decreases in market share could have a material effect on our business condition or results of operation. We face intense competition from a diverse range of competitors, including operating divisions of companies much larger and with far greater resources than we have. If we are unable to maintain our market share, our business could suffer.\nFluctuations in the supply and prices of raw materials may negatively impact our financial results.\nWe obtain raw materials needed to manufacture our products from a number of suppliers. Many of these raw materials are petroleum-based derivatives. Under normal market conditions, these materials are generally available on the open market and from a variety of producers. From time to time, however, the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate (as was experienced in the second half of fiscal 2021 and in the fiscal 2022 period), which could impair our ability to procure necessary materials, or increase the cost of manufacturing our products. If the prices of raw materials increase, and we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers, we could experience reduced profit margins.\nIf our products fail to perform as expected, or if we experience product recalls, we could incur significant and unexpected costs and lose existing and future business.\nOur products are complex and could have defects or errors presently unknown to us, which may give rise to claims against us, diminish our brands or divert our resources from other purposes. Despite testing, new and existing products could contain defects and errors and may in the future contain manufacturing or design defects, errors or performance problems when first introduced, or even after these products have been used by our customers for a period of time. These problems could result in expensive and time-consuming design modifications or warranty charges, changes to our manufacturing processes, product recalls, significant increases in our maintenance costs, or exposure to liability for damages, any of which may result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, require significant management attention, damage our reputation and customer relationships, and adversely affect our business, our operating results and our cash flow.\nThe Companys results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.\nWe face various risks related to public health issues, including epidemics, pandemics, and other outbreaks, including the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic had created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. The Company experienced lower sales as a result of the economic disruption (most acutely in the first half of fiscal 2021), and initiated cost-saving measures, including a targeted workforce reduction in 2020, in response to the uncertainties associated with the scope and duration of the pandemic. The extent to which public health issues, including epidemics or pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, impact the Companys business, operations and financial results in future periods will depend on numerous evolving factors that it may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; future domestic and international waves and variants seen in public health issues, like COVID-19 and current vaccines effectiveness\nagainst such variants; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on its customers demand for its goods and services and its vendors ability to supply it with raw materials; its ability to sell and provide goods and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of its customers to pay for goods and services; and any closures of its customers offices and facilities. Customers may also slow down decision-making, delay planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements.\nFurther, the effects of public health issues like a pandemic may also increase the Companys cost of capital or make additional capital more difficult or available only on terms less favorable to it. A sustained downturn may also result in the carrying value of the Companys goodwill or other intangible assets exceeding their fair value, which may require it to recognize an impairment to those assets. A sustained downturn in the financial markets and asset values may have the effect of increasing the Companys pension funding obligations in order to ensure that its qualified pension plan continues to be adequately funded, which may divert cash flow from other uses.\nWe may experience difficulties in the redesign and consolidation of our manufacturing facilities which could impact shipments to customers, product quality, and our ability to realize cost savings.\nWe currently have several ongoing projects to streamline our manufacturing operations, which include the redesign and consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities in order to reduce overhead costs. Despite our planning, we may be unable to effectively leverage assets, personnel, and business processes in the transition of production among manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty is inherent within the facility redesign and consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits of these streamlining projects, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality.\nStrategic Risks\nWe face risks associated with the Merger.\nOn July 21, 2023, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Formulations Parent Corporation, an affiliate of investment funds managed by KKR, and Merger Sub. The consummation of the Merger is conditioned on the receipt of the approval of our shareholders, which we received on October 6, 2023, as well as the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and performance in all material respects by each party of its obligations under the Merger Agreement. The 30-day waiting period under the HSR Act expired on September 5, 2023. Consummation of the Merger is not subject to a financing condition. Although we are not aware of any conditions that would cause the Merger not to be consummated, there is no assurance that the conditions to the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. Additionally, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer a number of consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and stock price. There are numerous risks related to the Merger, including the following:\nVarious conditions of the Merger may not be waived or satisfied;\nThe Merger may not be consummated, which among other things may cause our share price to decline to the extent that the current price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed;\nThe failure to consummate the Merger may result in negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community;\nRequired regulatory approvals from governmental entities may delay the Merger;\nOur ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees may be adversely affected;\nThe attention of our employees and management may be diverted due to activities related to the Merger;\nDisruptions from the Merger, whether or not it is completed, may harm our relationship with our employees, customers, distributors, suppliers, or other business partners, and may result in a loss of or a reduction in purchases by our customers; and\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us from engaging in certain actions without Parents approval, which could prevent us from pursuing certain business opportunities outside the ordinary course of business that arise prior to the closing of the Merger.\nIn addition, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and those fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated.\nOur business strategy includes the pursuit of strategic acquisitions, which may not be successful if they happen at all.\nFrom time to time, we engage in discussions with potential target companies concerning potential acquisitions. In executing our acquisition strategy, we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates. In addition, we may face competition from other companies for acquisition candidates, making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms. We have historically financed larger acquisitions with additional borrowings under our bank credit agreements. Our credit agreement places certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, and imposes certain financial covenants on us that may limit our ability to borrow. If we incur additional indebtedness in order to finance an acquisition, that indebtedness may reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes, may increase our vulnerability to adverse economic conditions, and may expose us to the risk of increased interest rates. If we finance an acquisition through the issuance of equity securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders would be proportionately diluted.\nEven if we do identify a suitable acquisition target and are able to negotiate and close a transaction (as we did in fiscal 2023 for NuCera and fiscal 2021 for both ABchimie and the operations of Emerging Technologies, Inc. (ETI)), the integration of an acquired business into our operations involves numerous risks, including potential difficulties in integrating an acquired companys product line with ours; the diversion of our resources and managements attention from other business concerns; the potential loss of key employees; limitations imposed by antitrust or merger control laws in the United States or other jurisdictions; risks associated with entering a new geographical or product market; and the day-to-day management of a larger and more diverse combined company.\nWe may not realize the synergies, operating efficiencies, market position or revenue growth we anticipate from acquisitions, and our failure to effectively manage the above risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and financial performance.\nInternational Risks\nIf we cannot successfully manage the unique challenges presented by international markets, we may not be successful in expanding our international operations.\nOur strategy includes expansion of our operations in existing and new international markets by selective acquisitions and strategic alliances. Our ability to successfully execute our strategy in international markets is affected by many of the same operational risks we face in expanding our U.S. operations. In addition, our international expansion may be adversely affected by our ability to identify and gain access to local suppliers as well as by local laws and customs, legal and regulatory constraints, political and economic conditions and currency regulations of the countries or regions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in the future. Risks inherent in our international operations also include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences, domestic and international tariffs and trade policies and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights. Additionally, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on future costs or on future cash flows from our international operations.\nCurrent and threatened tariffs on goods from China and other countries could result in lower revenue, profits and cash flows.\nThe Company imports raw materials from China, makes sales of finished goods into China and has manufacturing operations in China. The Company works to lower the potential negative effects of the tariffs through seeking alternative sources for our raw materials, when available and pragmatic, and, in certain cases, through altering our manufacturing logistics by utilizing non-U.S. manufacturing where tariffs do not apply. While we also attempt to pass on these additional costs to our customers, competitive factors (including competitors who import from other countries not subject to such tariffs) may limit our ability to sustain price increases and, as a result, may adversely impact our revenue, profits and cash flows. In addition, the imposition of tariffs may influence the sourcing habits of certain end users of our products which, in turn, could have a direct impact on the requirements of our direct customers for our products. Such an impact could adversely affect our revenue, profits and cash flows.\nIndustry Risks\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by uncertain economic and political conditions and the effects of these conditions on our customers businesses and levels of business activity.\nGlobal economic and political conditions can affect the businesses of our customers and the markets they serve. A severe or prolonged economic downturn or a negative or uncertain political climate could adversely affect, among others, the automotive, housing, construction, pipeline, energy, transportation, infrastructure or electronics industries. This may reduce demand for our products or depress pricing of those products, either of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Changes in global economic conditions or foreign and domestic trade policy could also shift demand to products for which we do not have competitive advantages, and this could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain. In addition, if we are unable to successfully anticipate changing economic and political conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to those changes and our business could be negatively affected.\nGeneral economic factors, domestically and internationally, may also adversely affect our financial performance through increased raw material costs or other expenses and by making access to capital more difficult.\nThe cumulative effect of higher interest rates, energy costs, inflation, levels of unemployment, healthcare costs, unsettled financial markets, and other economic factors (including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes to federal, state, local and international tax laws or the application or enforcement practices of such laws) could adversely affect our financial condition by increasing our manufacturing costs and other expenses at the same time that our customers may be scaling back demand for our products. Prices of certain commodity products, including oil and petroleum-based products, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, weather events and climate change, regional and global public health crises, market speculation, government regulations and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors can increase our cost of products and services sold and/or selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operating results. Disruptions in the credit markets may limit our ability to access debt capital for use in acquisitions or other purposes on advantageous terms or at all. If we are unable to manage our expenses in response to general economic conditions and margin pressures, or if we are unable to obtain capital for strategic acquisitions or other needs, then our results of operations would be negatively affected.\nOther Risks\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nWe depend significantly on our executive officers including our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, and on other key employees. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, our acquisition strategy will require that we attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. We have experienced in the past, and may continue to experience, an\nincreasingly competitive landscape relating to obtaining and retaining a manufacturing labor force. The inability to satisfy such requirements could have a negative impact on our ability to remain competitive in the future.\nFinancial market performance may have a material adverse effect on our pension plan assets and require additional funding requirements.\nSignificant and sustained declines in the financial markets may have a material adverse effect on the fair market value of the assets of our qualified pension plan. While these pension plan assets are considered non-financial assets since they are not carried on our balance sheet (i.e. the balance sheet reflects only the net of plan assets and obligations), the fair market valuation of these assets could impact our funding requirements, funded status or net periodic pension cost. Any significant and sustained declines in the fair market value of these pension assets could require us to increase our funding requirements, which would have an impact on our cash flow, and could also lead to additional pension expense.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, this may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and to include a report by our independent auditors attesting to such effectiveness. Any failure by us to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could adversely affect our ability to report accurately our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or if our independent auditors determine that we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, also could restrict our future access to the capital markets.\nFailure or compromise of security with respect to an operating or information system or portable electronic device could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition or the effectiveness of our internal controls over operations and financial reporting.\nWe are highly dependent on automated systems to record and process our daily transactions and certain other components of our financial statements. Notwithstanding efforts to ensure the integrity of our automated systems, we could experience a failure of one or more of these systems, or a compromise of our security due to technical system flaws, data input or recordkeeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft.\nWe could be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, epidemics, pandemics, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, malware, ransomware, and electrical/telecommunications outages). All of these risks are also applicable wherever we rely on outside vendors to provide services. Operating system failures, disruptions, or the compromise of security with respect to operating systems or portable electronic devices (with information technology security threats increasing in frequency and sophistication) could subject us to liability claims, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, or adversely affect our business, results from operations, financial condition, cash flow or internal control over financial reporting.

Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the Company does not expect that the outcome in any of these matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, judgments could be rendered, or settlements agreed to, that could adversely affect the Companys operating results or cash flows in a particular period. The Company routinely assesses all its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable. item 4 - mine safety disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5 - Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur common stock is traded on the NYSE American under the symbol CCF. As of October 31, 2023, there were 244 shareholders of record of our Common Stock and we believe there were approximately 7,799 beneficial owners who held shares through brokers or other nominees. On that date, the closing price of our common stock was $127.06 per share as reported by the NYSE American.\nSingle annual cash dividend payments were declared and scheduled to be paid subsequent to each year ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 in the amounts of $1.00 and $1.00 per common share, respectively. Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants which may have the effect of limiting the amount of dividends that we can pay.\nComparative Stock Performance\nThe following line graph compares the yearly percentage change in our cumulative total shareholder return on the Common Stock for the last five fiscal years with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index (the S&P 500 Index), and a composite peer index that is weighted by market equity capitalization (the Peer Group Index). The companies included in our Peer Group Index are Henkel AG & Co KGaA, H.B. Fuller Company, CSW Industrials, Inc., Element Solutions, Inc., Quaker Chemical Corporation, and RPM International, Inc.

This material should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe discussion of the comparison of our fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 results was previously presented in the Managements Discussion & Analysis in Part II, Item 7 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 10, 2022 and has been omitted from this section pursuant to Instruction 1 to Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K.\nSelected Relationships within the Consolidated Statements of Operations\nYears Ended August 31,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nRevenue\n$\n404,015\n$\n325,660\n$\n293,336\nNet income\n$\n33,182\n$\n44,671\n$\n44,920\nIncrease (decrease) in revenue from prior year\nAmount\n$\n78,355\n$\n32,324\n$\n32,174\nPercentage\n%\n%\n%\nIncrease (decrease) in net income from prior year\nAmount\n$\n(11,489)\n$\n(249)\n$\n10,763\nPercentage\n(26)\n%\n(1)\n%\n%\nPercentage of revenue:\nRevenue\n%\n%\n%\nCost of products and services sold\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nResearch and product development costs\nAcquisition-related costs\n-\nOther (income) expense, net\n*\nIncome before income taxes\n%\n%\n%\nIncome taxes\nNet income\n%\n%\n%\n* denotes less than one percent\nNote: Some percentage of revenue amounts may not sum due to rounding\nExecutive Overview\nResults of Operations\nThe Companys revenue grew in fiscal 2023, with the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Industrial Tapes operating segments surpassing revenue achieved in fiscal 2022. The increase in revenue for fiscal 2023 was primarily attributed to inorganic growth from our NuCera Solutions (NuCera) business acquired in the first month of fiscal 2023 and our electronic and industrial coatings product line (included within our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment) coupled with revenue generated by our cable materials, specialty products and pulling and detection product lines (included within our Industrial Tapes operating segment). Tempering the overall increase in fiscal 2023 revenue was decreased demand seen in our Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing operating segment.\nThe Companys gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 36.0% in fiscal 2023 compared to 37.8% in fiscal 2022. Despite the Companys sales growth in fiscal 2023, the Company continues to have less favorable gross margin compared to the comparable prior fiscal period. The decrease in gross margin percentage in the fiscal period is primarily attributed to lower gross margin from our NuCera business. Additionally, the Companys gross margin was negatively impacted by customer destocking caused by customer inventory reduction initiatives seen in the first half of fiscal 2023.\nAfter being negatively impacted by inflationary pressures in fiscal 2022, the gross margin for our organic business has stabilized due to measures implemented in fiscal 2022, including sales price increases fully realized in fiscal 2023 and the Companys supply chain strategy to actively explore secondary sourcing initiatives to locate alternative suppliers for our critical raw materials. Inflationary pressures did not have a significant impact on our profitability in the fiscal year.\nThe Companys operating expenses increased in the year-to-date period over the comparable prior period. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to the inclusion of expenses from our NuCera business including purchase accounting adjustments such as additional amortization expected to recur in future periods and backlog intangible that was fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter, acquisition-related costs related to the merger agreement dated July 21, 2023, and lease impairment and write-off of long-term assets, all of which negatively impacted operating income over the fiscal 2023 period.\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow\nChase Corporations balance sheet remained healthy as of August 31, 2023, with cash on hand of $49,019,000, and a current ratio of 4.4. The Companys cash position remained steady including cash flow from operations and debt paydown. The Companys disciplined inventory reduction approach in the fiscal period has continued to allow the Company to make subsequent payments on our long-term debt and improve cash flow. Furthermore, during the second fiscal quarter Chase Corporation paid out an annual cash dividend of $9,500,000 on December 9, 2022.\nThe Company had $105,000,000 outstanding balance on its $200,000,000 revolving credit facility as of August 31, 2023, related to the funding of the NuCera acquisition as noted above. The Company made $75,000,000 in principal payments related to the outstanding balance over the course of fiscal 2023.\nPending Merger\nOn July 21, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub. See Business-Other Business Developments-Merger Agreement in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue\nTotal revenue increased $78,355,000, or 24.1% to $404,015,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023, compared to $325,660,000 in fiscal 2022. Out of the $78,355,000 increase in fiscal 2023 revenue, 89% relates to inorganic revenue from our NuCera business and the remaining increase in revenue is primarily attributable to sales price increases fully realized in fiscal 2023.\nRevenue by Segment\nThe Company has three reportable operating segments summarized below:\nSegment\nProduct Lines\nManufacturing Focus and Products\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\nElectronic and Industrial Coatings\nFunctional Additives\nProtective coatings, including moisture protective coatings and cleaning solutions, and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics; polyurethane dispersions, polymeric microspheres and superabsorbent polymers; highly differentiated specialty waxes and polymers.\nIndustrial Tapes\nCable Materials\nSpecialty Products\nPulling and Detection\nElectronic Materials\nProtective tape and coating products and services, including insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers; laminated durable papers, packaging and industrial laminate products and custom manufacturing services; pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cable and water and natural gas lines; and cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging.\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\nCoating and Lining Systems\nPipeline Coatings\nBuilding Envelope\nBridge and Highway\nProtective coatings and tape products, including coating and lining systems for use in liquid storage and containment applications; protective coatings for pipeline and general construction applications; adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications; high-performance polymeric asphalt additives and expansion and control joint systems for use in the transportation and architectural markets.\nResults of Operations\nRevenue and Income Before Income Taxes by Segment are as follows:\nIncome Before\n% of\nRevenue\nIncome Taxes\nRevenue\n(Dollars in thousands)\nFiscal 2023\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n$\n207,900\n$\n29,314\n(a), (b)\n%\nIndustrial Tapes\n153,660\n47,694\n%\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n42,455\n14,729\n%\n$\n404,015\n91,737\n%\nLess corporate and common costs\n(48,546)\n(c)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n43,191\nFiscal 2022\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n$\n135,770\n$\n37,657\n(d)\n%\nIndustrial Tapes\n143,954\n41,387\n%\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n45,936\n17,415\n%\n$\n325,660\n96,459\n%\nLess corporate and common costs\n(37,861)\n(e)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n58,598\nFiscal 2021\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n$\n126,864\n$\n36,520\n(f)\n%\nIndustrial Tapes\n120,873\n37,407\n%\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n45,599\n15,913\n(g)\n%\n$\n293,336\n89,840\n%\nLess corporate and common costs\n(31,246)\n(h)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n58,594\n(a) Includes a $702 year-to-date loss on the upward adjustment of the performance-based earn out contingent consideration associated with the September 2020 acquisition of ABchimie, $516 in operations optimization costs related to the move from Woburn, MA to OHara Township, PA, $862 loss on impairment/write-off of long-term asset related to the Woburn, MA facility, $331 year-to-date loss on impairment/write-off of long-term asset related to the relocation of the Woodlands, TX facility to the new NuCera-related R&D facility in Houston, TX, and $492 and $3 year-to-date loss on impairment/write-off of long-term asset related to a discontinued NuCera-related engineering design study and fixed asset disposal from our Barnsdall, OK facility, respectively\n(b) Includes $2,242 of purchase accounting inventory adjustment related to the Companys NuCera business and $2,280 of backlog amortization fully amortized related to the Companys NuCera business both incurred during the first quarter of the fiscal year\n(c) Includes $1,476 in operations optimization costs related to the Companys ERP upgrade, $4,270 of acquisition-related expenses attributable to the merger agreement signed on July 21, 2023, $29 of acquisition-related expenses attributable to NuCera\n(d) For 2022, includes a $432 loss on the upward adjustment of the performance-based earn out contingent consideration associated with the September 2020 acquisition of ABchimie, $463 in operations optimization costs related to the move from Woburn, MA to OHara Township, PA and $147 of operations optimization costs related to the move from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC\n(e) For 2022, includes $232 of operations optimization costs related to the Companys move to the new corporate headquarters within Westwood, MA and $4,000 of acquisition-related expenses attributable to NuCera\n(f) For 2021, includes $1,664 in loss on the upward adjustment of the performance-based earn out contingent consideration associated with the September 2020 acquisition of ABchimie and $977 in exit costs related to the movement of the sealants system business out of the Newark, CA location and into the Hickory, NC location during fiscal 2021\n(g) For 2021, includes expense of $100 for the write-down of certain assets under construction\n(h) For 2021, includes $128 in acquisition-related expense attributable to the February 2021 acquisition of the operations of ETi\nTotal Revenue\nRevenue for our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment increased in fiscal 2023 over the comparable prior year period. The segment revenue increased $72,130,000, or 53% to $207,900,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $135,770,000 in fiscal 2022. The year-to-date increase in revenue was predominately due to the inorganic growth from our NuCera business acquired on the first day of fiscal 2023, totaling $69,669,000. The remaining increase in revenue for the fiscal period was primarily attributed to sales price increases realized over the comparable fiscal year and increased demand for our world-wide focused electronic and industrial coatings product line, totaling $10,808,000. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue in the fiscal year-to-date period was a reduction in revenue in our organic functional product line due to decreased customer demand in North America over the comparable prior fiscal year, totaling $8,347,000.\nRevenue for our Industrial Tapes segment increased in fiscal 2023 over the comparable prior year period. The segment revenue increased $9,706,000, or 6.7% to $153,660,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $143,954,000 in fiscal 2022. Sales price increases realized over the prior year and increased demand for our North American-focused specialty products, pulling and detection, and cable materials product lines increased fiscal 2023 revenue by $11,710,000. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue in the fiscal year was a year-to-date reduction in sales volume from our Asia-focused electronic materials product line, totaling $2,004,000.\nRevenue in the Companys Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment decreased $3,481,000, or 7.6% to $42,455,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $45,936,000 in fiscal 2022. Negatively impacting sales for the segment in the fiscal year was a reduction in sales volume for our building envelope product line related to customer destocking due to prior year demand attributed to customer inventory increase initiatives in reaction to supply chain shortages, totaling $4,147,000. Also negatively impacting sales for the segment for the fiscal year was our pipeline coatings product line predominately due to delayed projects in the Middle East market over the prior comparable period coupled with customer destocking initiatives in North American oil and gas markets, totaling $927,000. Partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was our coating and lining systems product line, with a revenue increase of $1,283,000, attributed to sales price increases realized over the prior year and increased demand seen in the last quarter of the fiscal year due to the commencement of delayed projects affected by the extended rainy season seen in the west coast of North America. Also, partially offsetting the decrease in revenue was our bridge and highway product line, with a revenue increase of $310,000, predominately due to sales price increases realized over the prior year coupled with increased demand seen in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to the commencement of bridge and highway projects in North America.\nRoyalties and commissions in the Adhesive, Sealants and Additives segment totaled $3,133,000 and $3,198,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 was primarily due to decreased demand seen in our electronic and industrial coatings products by our licensed manufacturer in Asia.\nCost of Products and Services Sold\nCost of products and services sold increased $55,866,000 or 27.6% to $258,574,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $202,708,000 in fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the relative percentages of cost of products and services sold to revenue for our three operating segments:\nFiscal Years Ended August 31,\nCost of products and services sold\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n%\n%\n%\nIndustrial Tapes\n%\n%\n%\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\n%\n%\n%\nTotal Company\n%\n%\n%\nCost of products and services sold in the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was $133,484,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $80,619,000 in fiscal 2022. Cost of products and services sold in the Industrial Tapes segment was $100,264,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $96,132,000 in fiscal 2022. Costs of products and services sold in the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment was $24,826,000 for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023 compared to $25,957,000 in fiscal 2022.\nAs a percentage of revenue, cost of products and services sold increased in fiscal 2023 for both the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment as compared to the prior comparable period. The decrease in relative gross margin for our Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment was impacted by lower historical gross margin from our NuCera business. The decrease in relative gross margin for the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment in fiscal 2023 was primarily due to decreased production affecting overhead variances. As a percentage of revenue, costs of products and services sold decreased for the Industrial Tapes segment in fiscal 2023 due to sales price increases realized in the current fiscal period coupled with increased demand.\nWith the composition of the Companys finished goods and the markets it serves, the costs of certain commodities (including petroleum-based solvents, films, yarns, polymers and nonwovens, aluminum and copper foils, specialty papers, and various resins, adhesives and inks) directly and indirectly affect both the purchase price of our raw materials and the market demand for our product offerings. In an effort to preserve margins, the Company diligently monitors raw material and commodities pricing across all its product lines in its efforts to preserve margins.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $22,679,000 or 41.7% to $77,117,000 during fiscal 2023 compared to $54,438,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in activity is attributed to the inclusion of expenses from our NuCera business (including additional amortization expected to recur in future periods and backlog intangible that was fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter), which was acquired on the first day of fiscal 2023. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 19% and 17% of total revenue in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nResearch and Product Development Costs\nResearch and product development costs increased $1,620,000 or 36.7% to $6,035,000 during fiscal 2023 compared to $4,415,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in research and product development costs is primarily related to our NuCera business, which was acquired in the first month of fiscal 2023.\nOperations Optimization Costs\nERP System Upgrade\nThe Company recognized $1,476,000 in operations optimization costs during fiscal 2023 and $0 in fiscal 2022, related to the ERP system upgrade. Please see note 19 - Operations Optimization to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on Operations Optimization Costs.\nRelocation of Adhesives Systems Manufacturing to OHara Township, PA\nThe Company recognized $516,000 in operations optimization costs during fiscal 2023 and 463,000 in fiscal 2022, related in operations optimization expense related to the consolidation of the Woburn, MA location. Please see note 19 - Operations Optimization to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on Operations Optimization Costs.\nRelocation of Sealants Systems Manufacturing to Hickory, NC\nThe Company recognized $0 and $147,000 in operations optimization costs during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the relocation of the Sealants Systems Manufacturing from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC location. Please see note 19 - Operations Optimization to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on Operations Optimization Costs.\nRelocation of Chase Corporate Headquarters\nThe Company recognized $0 and $232,000 in operations optimization costs during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the relocation of the Companys headquarters to another location within Westwood, MA. Please see note 19 - Operations Optimization to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on Operations Optimization Costs.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nMerger Agreement\nThe Company incurred $4,270,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, related to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 21, 2023. Please see note 14 - Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nNuCera Solutions\nThe Company incurred $29,000 (in the first fiscal quarter) and $4,000,000 (in the fourth fiscal quarter) of acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to our acquisition of NuCera Solutions (NuCera) on September 1, 2022 (first day of fiscal 2023). Please see note 14 - Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the acquisition of NuCera Solutions.\nLoss on Impairment/write-off of long-term assets\nWoburn, MA Facility\nThe Company expensed $548,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as a lease impairment related to the Woburn, MA facility relocation. The Woburn, MA facility closure is related to the relocation of the Companys Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segments electronic and industrial coatings product line to the Companys existing OHara Township, PA location.\nOn the last day of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company signed a termination agreement with the landlord for the Woburn, MA facility and wrote off the right-of-use asset and liability of the Woburn, MA lease, expensing $314,000.\nWoodlands, TX Facility\nOn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company moved out of the Woodlands, TX facility (previously NuCera Corporate and R&D headquarters) to a smaller R&D facility in Houston, TX. On the last day of the third fiscal quarter, the Company signed a sublease agreement for the Woodlands office and expensed $211,000 as a lease impairment related to this facility in the third quarter of the fiscal period. The project is now complete and no future costs related to the facility relocation are anticipated.\nAdditionally, the Company wrote off $120,000 of fixed assets primarily related to the R&D relocation of the Houston, TX facility in the third quarter and year-to-date period of fiscal 2023.\nNuCera-related fixed asset disposals\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company wrote off $492,000 and $3,000, related to a discontinued engineering design study and fixed asset disposal from our Barnsdall, OK facility, respectively.\nLoss on Contingent Consideration\nAs part of the September 1, 2020 (fiscal 2021) acquisition of ABchimie, the Company incurred a performance-based earn out liability potentially worth an additional \u20ac7,000,000 (approximately $8,330,000 at the time of the transaction) in consideration. Following its initial recording of an accrual for $928,000 at the acquisition date, the Company recorded charges of $702,000, $432,000 and $1,664,000 in expenses related to adjustments to the performance-based earn out accrual were recorded during the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $8,981,000 was recognized in fiscal 2023 compared to $425,000 in fiscal 2022. The year over year increase in interest expense relates to our outstanding long-term debt which was used to fund our NuCera business acquisition at the beginning of fiscal 2023.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther (expense) income was an expense of ($1,435,000) in fiscal 2023 compared to income of $198,000 in the comparable period, a difference of $1,633,000. Other (expense) income primarily includes foreign exchange gains (losses) caused by changes in exchange rates on transactions or balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, non-service cost components of periodic pension expense (including pension-related settlement costs due to the timing of lump-sum distributions), interest income, rental income and other non-trade/non-royalty/non-commission receipts. The year over year change in total other (expense) income was largely due to the recognition of a foreign exchange loss in fiscal 2023 as compared to a foreign exchange gain in fiscal 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Companys recognized effective tax rate was 23.2% and 23.8% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company is utilizing the 21% Federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) passed in December 2017. Please see Note 7 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nNet Income\nNet income decreased $11,489,000 or 25.7% to $33,182,000 in fiscal 2023 compared to $44,671,000 in fiscal 2022. The decrease in net income is predominately caused by an increase in operating expenses and interest expense in fiscal 2023. The increase in operating expenses includes incremental depreciation and amortization related to our NuCera business, lease impairment/write-off of right of use asset, and first quarter purchase accounting adjustments related to the NuCera acquisition, which include backlog fully amortized during the first fiscal quarter - all of which negatively impacted net income over the comparable prior year.\nLiquidity and Sources of Capital\nThe Companys overall cash and cash equivalents balance decreased $266,476,000 to $49,019,000 at August 31, 2023 compared to $315,495,000 at August 31, 2022. The lower year over year cash balance was primarily attributed to the $180,000,000 of cash drawn from the revolving credit facility prior to the end of fiscal 2022, the proceeds of which were used, together with $70,000,000 in cash on hand, to fund the acquisition of NuCera which closed on September 1, 2022 (the first day of fiscal 2023). In addition, the Company made $75,000,000 of principal debt payments. The decrease in cash balance at August 31, 2023 is offset by cash provided by operations of $74,336,000.\nOf the above-noted balances, $28,350,000 and $28,951,000 were held outside the United States by Chase Corporation and its foreign subsidiaries as of August 31, 2023 and August 31, 2022, respectively. Given the Companys cash position and borrowing capability in the United States and the potential for increased investment and acquisitions in foreign jurisdictions, prior to the second quarter of fiscal 2018 the Company did not have a history of repatriating a significant portion of its foreign cash. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, significant changes in the Internal Revenue Code were enacted, changing the U.S. taxable nature of previously unrepatriated foreign earnings. Following the passage of the Tax Act, the Company repatriated $10,499,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2018 and $17,230,000 in fiscal 2019. No additional amounts were repatriated in fiscal year 2020, 2021, or 2022. The Company repatriated $11,458,000 in U.K. foreign earnings in fiscal 2023. Please see Note 7 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the effects of the Tax Act.\nCash flow provided by operations was $74,336,000 in fiscal year 2023 compared to $34,859,000 in fiscal 2022. The increase in cash provided by operations year over year was primarily related to increase in revenue, mainly driven by our NuCera business and reduction on inventory spend.\nThe ratio of current assets to current liabilities was 4.4 as of August 31, 2023 compared to 12.4 (or 7.3 excluding the $180,000,000 cash drawn from our revolving credit facility to fund the NuCera acquisition) as of August 31, 2022. The decrease in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities is primarily due to the cash outflow of $250,000,000 to fund the acquisition of NuCera mentioned above.\nCash flow used in investing activities of $257,231,000 was primarily due to the purchase of NuCera, which occurred on the first day of fiscal 2023.\nCash flows used in financing activities of $85,418,000 was due to principal payments (totaling $75,000,000) on our long-term debt related to the funding of the NuCera acquisition mentioned above. Please see note 6 - Long-Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the Companys credit facility. Additionally, the cash flows used in financing activities was due to a cash dividend of $1.00 per share (totaling $9,500,000) to shareholders of record on November 30, 2022 and paid on December 9, 2022, the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe Companys Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement) with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and the other lenders party thereto, which is used to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit loan (the Revolving Facility), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed $200,000,000 at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000,000 at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had $105,000,000 in long-term debt related to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions that closed on September 1, 2022. The long-term debt has a weighted average interest rate of 6.43% as of August 31, 2023. See Note 6 - Long Term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Credit Facility. We expect the Credit Facility to be paid off in connection with the Merger.\nThe Company has several ongoing capital projects, including upgrading the Companys ERP system, as well as its facility rationalization and consolidation initiative, which are important to its long-term strategic goals. Machinery and equipment may be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in the Companys production facilities.\nWe may acquire companies or other assets in future periods which are complementary to our business. The Company believes that its existing resources, including cash on hand and the Credit Agreement, together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings, will be sufficient to fund its cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing, if needed, will be available on favorable terms, if at all.\nTo the extent that interest rates increase in future periods, we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions.\nWe have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at August 31, 2023 under operating leases and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (dollars in thousands):\nPayments Due\nContractual Obligations\nTotal\n2029 and thereafter\nOperating leases\n$\n7,170\n$\n1,664\n$\n1,439\n$\n1,101\n$\n$\n$\n1,675\nTotal\n$\n7,170\n$\n1,664\n$\n1,439\n$\n1,101\n$\n$\n$\n1,675\nWe may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement, if any, with the respective taxing authorities. The Companys unrecognized tax benefits was $1,895,000 as of August 31, 2023. See Note 7 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe also expect to make payments as needed to satisfy our funding obligations for our obligations for pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. As of August 31, 2023, we had recognized an accrued benefit plan liability of $5,679,000 representing the unfunded obligations of the pension benefit plans. See Note 9 - Benefits and Pension Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information, including expected pension benefit payments for the next 10 years.\nThe Company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed expected requirements or extend beyond one year.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor discussion of the newly issued accounting pronouncements see Recently Adopted Accounting Standards in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments, and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies and estimates. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and operating results, and require management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of a company.\nJudgments, assumptions, and estimates are used for, but not limited to, the allowances for accounts receivable; inventory allowances; business combinations, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; revenue; income tax reserves; deferred income taxes; stock-based compensation; as well as discount and return rates used to calculate pension obligations. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness Combinations are recorded using the acquisition method. We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Any excess of the purchase price is largely attributable to the synergies and economies of scale from combining operations, technologies and research and development capabilities.\nThe Company assesses the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participants use of the asset. Some of the most significant assumptions used include the discount rate, forward-looking financial information, and estimated customer attrition rates. A change in one of these assumptions could have material changes on the value of the intangible assets and goodwill which will impact the amortization expense in future periods and the goodwill impairment evaluation. During the year 2023, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of the intangible assets related to the NuCera acquisition would have decreased or increased the goodwill amount by $14,802,000 and it would have increased or decreased the year-to-date amortization expense by $1,504,000.\nTransaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred. Item 7a - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nChase limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. At August 31, 2023, other than the Companys restricted investments (which are restricted for use in non-qualified retirement savings plans for certain key employees and members of the Board of Directors), all of the Companys funds were either in demand deposit accounts or investment instruments that meet high credit quality standards, such as money market funds, government securities, or commercial paper.\nChases U.S. operations have limited currency exposure since substantially all transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. However, the Companys European and Asian operations are subject to currency exchange fluctuations. The Company continues to review its policies and procedures to control this exposure while maintaining the benefit from these operations and sales not denominated in U.S. dollars. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in the exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar and the Euro and the U.S. dollar would not have a material direct effect on the Companys overall liquidity.\nAs of August 31, 2023, the Company had cash balances in the following foreign currencies (with USD equivalents in thousands):\nCurrency Code\nCurrency Name\nUSD Equivalent at August 31, 2023\nGBP\nBritish Pound\n$\n13,182\nEUR\nEuro\n$\n10,316\nINR\nIndian Rupee\n$\n1,348\nCAD\nCanadian Dollar\n$\nCNY\nChinese Yuan\n$\nSGD\nSingapore Dollar\n$\nThe Company will continue to review its current cash balances denominated in foreign currency in light of current tax guidelines, including the impact of the Tax Act to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, working capital requirements, infrastructure improvements and potential acquisitions.\nThe Company recognized a foreign currency translation gain for the year ended August 31, 2023 in the amount of $5,385,000 related to its European, Asian and Indian operations, which is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) within its Statement of Equity and Statement of Comprehensive Income. The Company does not have or utilize any derivative financial instruments.\nThe Company pays interest on its outstanding long-term debt at interest rates that fluctuate based upon changes in various base interest rates. There was an outstanding balance of long-term debt of $105,000,000 for the year ended August 31, 2023.\nSee Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Sources of Capital, Note 6 - Long-Term Debt and Note 16 - Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our outstanding long-term debt. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in variable interest rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nThe following Consolidated Financial Statements of Chase Corporation are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements:\nPage No.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 248)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended August 31, 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended August 31, 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended August 31, 2023\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended August 31, 2023\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nChase Corporation\nOpinion on the financial statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chase Corporation (a Massachusetts corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of the acquisition-date fair value of customer relationships\nAs described in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, on September 1, 2023 the Company acquired NuCera Solutions for a total purchase price of $250 million. As part of the transaction, the Company recorded a customer relationships intangible asset of $119 million related to NuCera US customer relationships. We identified the valuation of the acquisition-date fair value of the NuCera US customer relationships as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the valuation of the NuCera US customer relationships is a critical audit matter were (i) the significant judgments applied by management in developing forecasted financial information and selecting a customer attrition rate for use in the fair value measurement of acquired customer relationship (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity required in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions relating to the projected forecasted information including revenue growth rate, weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and customer attrition rate.\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation of the acquisition-date fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset included the following, among others:\n\u25cf We tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over the Companys estimation process for recognition and measurement of customer relationships.\n\u25cf We evaluated the annual customer attrition rate by examining the Companys historical customer attrition data, as well as comparing attrition rates to prior acquisitions.\n\u25cf We tested the reasonableness of managements forecasted cash flows by comparing forecasts to historical results, subsequent results, and projected market and industry trends.\n\u25cf With the assistance of our valuation specialist, we assessed the key assumptions and methodologies used in valuing the customer relationship, including WACC and customer attrition rates.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since

All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company uses the U.S. dollar as the functional currency for financial reporting. Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform to the current years presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist primarily of demand deposit accounts or investment instruments that meet high credit quality standards such as money market funds, government securities, or commercial paper. The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nCredit risk related to cash and cash equivalents is limited based on the creditworthiness of the financial institutions at which these funds are held. We maintain cash balances in multiple banks. Accounts located in the United States are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250. Certain of our account balances exceed the FDIC limit. Cash balances held outside the United States totaled $28,350 as of August 31, 2023.\nAccounts Receivable\nAll trade accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for credit losses. The allowances for credit losses represent managements best estimate of the credit losses expected from our trade accounts receivable over the life of the\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nunderlying assets. Assets with similar risk characteristics are pooled together for determination of their current expected credit losses. The Company regularly performs detailed reviews of our pooled assets to evaluate the collectability of receivables based on a combination of past, current, and future financial and qualitative factors that may affect customers ability to pay. In circumstances where the Company is aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations, a specific reserve is recorded against amounts due to reduce the recognized receivable to the amount reasonably expected to be collected. Receivables are written off against these reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectable.\nPrior to September 1, 2020, the Company evaluated the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors. In cases where the Company was aware of circumstances that may have impaired a specific customers ability to meet its financial obligations to it, a specific allowance against amounts due to the Company was recorded, and thereby reduced the net recognized receivable to the amount the Company reasonably believed would be collected. For all other customers, the Company recognized allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables were past due, industry and geographic factors, the current business environment and its historical experience.\nInventory\nThe Company values inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. Management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held, forecasted demand and changes in technology. These assessments require management judgments and estimates, and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments. The Company estimates excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand, product transitions, and market conditions, and record adjustments to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value. The failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is stated at cost. The Company evaluates the potential impairment of goodwill annually each fourth quarter and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable. The Company performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. Factors that management considers in this assessment include general economic and industry conditions, overall financial performance (both current and projected), changes in strategy, changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets, and market capitalization. The Companys goodwill is allocated to each reporting unit based on the nature of the products manufactured by the respective business combinations that originally created the goodwill. The Company has identified a total of three reporting units, corresponding to its three operating segments, that are used to evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the Company would proceed to perform a quantitative impairment test. Under this quantitative analysis, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value, including goodwill. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the Company recognizes an impairment charge. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting unit using the income approach based on a discounted cash flow model. In addition, the Company uses the market approach, which compares the reporting unit to publicly-traded companies and transactions involving similar businesses, to support the conclusions based on the income approach.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of patents, formulas, trade names, customer relationships, developed technologies and trademarks. The Company capitalizes costs related to patent applications and technology agreements. The costs of these assets are amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or its statutory life. Capitalized costs are periodically\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nreviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful lives. Expenditures for maintenance repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred. Betterments and major renewals are capitalized. Upon retirement or other disposition of assets, related allowances for depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the determination of income or loss. The estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment are as follows:\nBuildings and improvements\nto\nyears\nMachinery and equipment\nto\nyears\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the useful life or the term of the lease.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for Leases using ASC Topic 842. At the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use (ROU) assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. The Company does not have any financing leases that are material in nature.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which the Company believes it could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment.\nThe Company has elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. The Company typically only includes an initial lease term in its assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in the Companys assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that the Company will renew.\nRestricted Investments and Deferred Compensation\nThe Company has a non-qualified deferred savings plan that covers its Board of Directors and a separate plan covering selected employees. Participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation for payment in a future tax year. The plans are funded by trusteed assets that are restricted to the payment of deferred compensation or satisfaction of the Companys general creditors. The Company accounts for the restricted investments as available for sale by recording net unrealized gains or losses in other comprehensive income as a component of stockholders equity.\nRevenue\nThe Company accounts for revenue using ASC Topic 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company accounts for revenue when: (a) there is approval and commitment from both parties; (b) the rights of the parties are identified; (c) payment terms are identified; (d) the contract has commercial substance; and (e) collectability of consideration is probable. Revenue is primarily derived from customer purchase orders, master sales agreements, and negotiated contracts, all of which represent contracts with customers. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our accounting for revenue.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nResearch and Product Development Costs\nResearch and product development costs are expensed as incurred and include primarily engineering salaries, overhead and materials used in connection with research and development projects. Research and development expense amounted to $6,035, $4,415 and $4,056 for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and was recorded within Research and product development costs on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPension Plans\nThe Company accounts for its pension plans following the requirements of ASC Topic 715, Compensation -Retirement Benefits (ASC 715). ASC 715 requires an employer to: (a) recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan; (b) measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employers fiscal year (with limited exceptions); and (c) recognize as a component of other comprehensive income, net of tax, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance.\nStock-Based Compensation\nIn accordance with the accounting for stock-based compensation guidance, ASC Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation (ASC 718), the Company measures and recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees, directors and consultants based on estimated fair values. This includes restricted stock, restricted stock units and stock options. The guidance allows for the continued use of the simplified method as the Company has concluded that its historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimating expected term.\nExpected volatility is determined by looking at a combination of historical volatility over the past six years as well as implied future volatility.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency\nThe financial position and results of operations of the Companys HumiSeal Europe Ltd and Chase Protective Coatings Ltd businesses are measured using the British pound as the functional currency. The financial position and results of operations of the Companys HumiSeal Europe SARL, ABchimie, and NuCera Solutions businesses in France are measured using euros as the functional currency. The financial position and results of the Companys HumiSeal India Private Limited business in India are measured using the Indian rupee as the functional currency. The financial position and results of operations of the NuCera Solutions operations in Singapore are measured using the Singapore dollar as the functional currency. The functional currency for all our other operations is the U.S. dollar. Revenue and expenses of these international businesses have been translated at average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are determined using current exchange rates for monetary items and historical exchange rates for other balance sheet items, and are recorded as a change in other comprehensive income (a component of stockholders equity). Transaction gains and losses generated from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of these international operations are included in other (expense) income on the consolidated statements of operations and were (expense) income of ($961), $442 and ($512) for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nliabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse. Tax credits are recorded as a reduction in income taxes. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Company estimates contingent income tax liabilities based on the guidance for accounting for uncertain tax positions as prescribed in ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. See Note 7 for more information on the Companys income taxes, including information on the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act) on our financial position and results of operations.\nNet Income Per Share\nThe Company has unvested share-based payment awards with a right to receive nonforfeitable dividends, which are considered participating securities under ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share (ASC 260). The Company allocates earnings to participating securities and computes earnings per share using the two-class method.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income is defined as the change in equity of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources, including foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities and adjustments related to the change in the funded status of the pension plans.\nBusiness Combinations\nBusiness Combinations are recorded using the acquisition method. We assign the value of the consideration transferred to acquire a business to the tangible assets, identifiable intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. Any excess of the purchase price is largely attributable to the synergies and economies of scale from combining operations, technologies and research and development capabilities.\nThe Company assesses the fair value of assets, including intangible assets, using a variety of methods, and each asset is measured at fair value from the perspective of a market participant. The method used to estimate the fair values of intangible assets incorporates significant assumptions regarding the estimates a market participant would make in order to evaluate an asset, including a market participants use of the asset. Some of the most significant assumptions used include the discount rate, forward-looking financial information, and estimated customer attrition rates. A change in one of these assumptions could have material changes on the value of the intangible assets and goodwill which will impact the amortization expense in future periods and the goodwill impairment evaluation.\nTransaction costs and restructuring costs associated with a transaction to acquire a business are expensed as incurred.\nSegments\nASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) codification establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. The Company is organized into three reportable operating segments: Adhesives, Sealants and Additives; Industrial Tapes; and Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing. The segments are distinguished by the nature of the products manufactured and how they are delivered to their respective markets.\nThe Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment offers innovative and specialized product offerings consisting of both end-use products and intermediates that are generally used in, or integrated into, another companys products.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nDemand for the segments product offerings is typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment leverages the core specialty chemical competencies of the Company, and serves diverse markets and applications. The segment sells predominantly into the transportation, appliances, medical, personal care, general industrial and environmental market verticals. The segments products include moisture protective coatings and cleaners and customized sealant and adhesive systems for electronics, polymeric microspheres, polyurethane dispersions, specialty polymers and superabsorbent polymers. Beginning September 1, 2022 (first day of fiscal 2023), the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segment includes the acquired operations of NuCera Solutions, within the functional additives product line.\nThe Industrial Tapes segment features wire and cable materials, specialty tapes, and other laminated and coated products. The segment derives its competitive advantage through its proven chemistries, diverse specialty offerings and the reliability its supply chain offers to end customers. These products are generally used in the assembly of other manufacturers products, with demand typically dependent upon general economic conditions. The Industrial Tapes segment sells mostly to established markets, with some exposure to growth opportunities through further development of existing products. Markets served include cable manufacturing, utilities and telecommunications, and electronics packaging. The segments offerings include insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers, laminated durable papers, laminates for the packaging and industrial laminate markets, custom manufacturing services, pulling and detection tapes used in the installation, measurement and location of fiber optic cable and water and natural gas lines, and cover tapes essential to delivering semiconductor components via tape and reel packaging.\nThe Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment is principally composed of project-oriented product offerings that are primarily sold and used as Chase branded products. End markets include new and existing infrastructure projects on oil, gas, water and wastewater pipelines, highways and bridge decks, water and wastewater containment systems, and commercial buildings. The segments products include protective coatings for pipeline applications, coating and lining systems for waterproofing and liquid storage applications, adhesives and sealants used in architectural and building envelope waterproofing applications, high-performance polymeric asphalt additives, and expansion joint systems for waterproofing applications in transportation and architectural markets. With sales generally dependent on outdoor project work, the segment experiences highly seasonal sales patterns.\nContingent Consideration\nIn connection with accounting for the ABchimie acquisition on September 1, 2020, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability included within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The contingent consideration liability was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model in an option pricing framework based on key inputs requiring significant judgments and estimates to be made by the Company, including forecasts of future earnings over the multiyear period encompassed by the earnout, and that are not all observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company assesses the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in Loss on contingent consideration on the consolidated statement of operations until the liability is settled. If fully realized, the contingent consideration due would total \u20ac7,000 (approximately $8,330 at the time of the initial transaction)\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFiscal 2023\nNo new accounting pronouncements were adopted in fiscal 2023.\nFiscal 2022\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which amends the accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendment requires that an entity acquiring the contract assets and contract liabilities in a business combination be recognized in accordance with ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The ASU is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods therein. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 on February 28, 2022 and any impact on the consolidated financial statements will be dependent on the magnitude and nature of future acquired entities.\nFiscal 2021\nIn March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The ASU applies to all entities that have contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The ASU provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the ASU do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022, except for hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022 for which an entity has elected certain optional expedients and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship. The ASU is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. ASU 2020-04 has not had, and the Company does not expect it to have in future periods, a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and disclosures. The Company adopted ASU 2020-04 on September 1, 2020.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which modifies the measurement approach for credit losses on financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis from an 'incurred loss' method to an 'expected loss' method. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses. ASU 2019-11 is an accounting pronouncement that amends ASU 2016-13. This amendment provides clarity and improves the codification to ASU 2016-13. The pronouncements are concurrently effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods therein. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 on September 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective transition method which resulted in no material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nNote 2-Inventory\nInventory consisted of the following as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nRaw materials\n$\n33,576\n$\n37,909\nWork in process\n9,789\n9,569\nFinished goods\n26,211\n15,561\nTotal Inventory\n$\n69,576\n$\n63,039\nNote 3-Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nLand and improvements\n$\n8,844\n$\n4,994\nBuildings\n16,848\n16,771\nMachinery and equipment\n78,425\n49,458\nLeasehold improvements\n12,900\n4,774\nConstruction in progress\n5,130\n122,147\n76,751\nAccumulated depreciation\n(61,678)\n(52,503)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n60,469\n$\n24,248\nR&D relocation of the Houston, TX facility\nThe Company wrote-off $120 of fixed assets primarily related to the R&D relocation of the Houston, TX facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The Company completed its review of the data and recommendations provided by the study in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and related to the recommendations of the commissioned engineering studies, the Company wrote down the value of certain non-operating production assets related to the pipeline coatings product line, within the Corrosion Protection and Waterproofing segment. Given the nature and prospects of the equipment, the Company determined its then carrying value exceeded its fair value and recognized an expense of $405\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nrelated to the machinery. The Company recognized an additional $100 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, to fully write-down the equipments value.

The Credit Agreement is used to provide for additional liquidity to finance acquisitions, working capital and capital expenditures, and for other general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes a revolving credit loan (the Revolving Facility), with borrowing capabilities not to exceed $200,000 at any time, with the ability to request an increase in this amount by an additional $100,000 at the individual or collective option of any of the Lenders. Effective February 1, 2023, the Credit Agreement transitioned to a secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) in substitution for the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and will commence at the next interest rate renewal period. The applicable interest rate for the Revolving Facility and Term Loan (defined below) is based on the effective SOFR base rate plus a SOFR adjustment based on the term of the interest rate period plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. The SOFR adjustment is based on interest rate periods of 1-month at .1%, 3-months at .15%, and 6-months at .25%. Prior to the transition to SOFR, the applicable interest rate for the Revolving Facility and Term Loan was based on the effective LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 1.00% to 1.75%, depending on the consolidated net leverage ratio of Chase and its subsidiaries. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had $105,000 in long-term debt related to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions that closed on September 1, 2022. The long-term debt has a weighted average interest rate of 6.43% as of August 31, 2023.\nThe Credit Agreement has a five-year term with interest payments due at the end of the applicable LIBOR or SOFR period (but in no event less frequently than the three-month anniversary of the commencement of such LIBOR or SOFR period) and principal payment due at the expiration of the agreement, July 27, 2026. The Company may elect a base rate option for all or a portion of the Revolving Facility, in which case interest payments shall be due with respect to such portion of the Revolving Facility on the last business day of each quarter. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, the Company may elect to convert all or a portion of the outstanding Revolving Facility into a new term loan twice during the term of the Revolving Facility (each, a Term Loan, and collectively with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facility), which Term Loan shall be payable quarterly in equal installments sufficient to amortize the original principal amount of such Term Loan on a ten year amortization schedule.\nThe outstanding balance on the Credit Facility is guaranteed by all of Chases direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries, which collectively had a carrying value of approximately $336,388 at August 31, 2023. The Credit Facility is subject to restrictive covenants under the Credit Agreement, and financial covenants that require Chase and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios on a consolidated basis, including a consolidated net leverage ratio of no greater than 3.25 to 1.00 and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of no less than 3.50 to 1.00 (both defined in the Credit Agreement). The Credit Agreement requires lender permission for acquisitions over a certain size, and allows the company to temporarily modify the consolidated leverage ratio when an acquisition greater than $50,000 is consummated during an applicable measurement period. Due to the NuCera acquisition, the consolidated leverage ratio was not to exceed 3.75 to 1.00 as of the end of the four fiscal quarters following the acquisition. Prepayment is allowed by the Credit Agreement at any time during the term of the agreement, subject to customary notice requirements and the payment of customary LIBOR or SOFR breakage fees. Chase Corporation was in compliance with the debt covenants under the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2023.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nNote 7-Income Taxes\nThe Company has applied the U.S. statutory Federal rate of 21%, enacted as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) in December 2017, for fiscal years end August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nIn fiscal 2019, the Company began recognizing an additional component of total Federal tax expense, the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) provision of the Tax Act, which became applicable to the Company in fiscal 2019. The Company elected to account for GILTI as a period cost, and therefore included GILTI expense in the effective tax rate calculation. This provision did not have a material effect on the effective tax rate for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company concluded that the Base Erosion and Anti Abuse Tax (BEAT) provision of the Tax Act, which also became applicable to the Company in fiscal 2019, had no effect on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nIn July 2020, the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released final regulations (TD 9901) that ease documentation standards and provide greater flexibility for taxpayers claiming the deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII). During fiscal 2023, the Companys effective tax rate included a FDII deduction benefit of $903. In addition, during fiscal 2023, the Company recognized $69 of tax benefit due to the expiration of statute of limitations.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (\"IRA\") was enacted into law on August 16, 2022. Included in the IRA was a provision to implement a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income for applicable corporations and a 1% excise tax on repurchases of stock. These provisions are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We are in the process of evaluating the provisions of the IRA, but we do not currently believe the IRA will have a material impact on our reported results, cash flows or financial position when it becomes effective.\nDomestic and foreign pre-tax income for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was:\nYear Ended August 31,\nUnited States\n$\n32,239\n$\n49,015\n$\n52,182\nForeign\n10,952\n9,583\n6,412\n$\n43,191\n$\n58,598\n$\n58,594\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was:\nYear Ended August 31,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n10,868\n$\n10,346\n$\n11,677\nState\n2,436\n2,589\nForeign\n3,146\n2,015\n2,123\nTotal current income tax provision\n16,450\n14,950\n14,582\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(5,212)\n(775)\n(832)\nState\n(783)\n(124)\nForeign\n(446)\n(295)\nTotal deferred income tax benefit\n(6,441)\n(1,023)\n(908)\nTotal income tax provision\n$\n10,009\n$\n13,927\n$\n13,674\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes differs from the amount computed by applying the Federal statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes.

The entire $599 of net operating loss carry forwards was utilized in fiscal 2022 and the operating loss for the year was $0. The net operating loss for fiscal 2023 was $0.\nChase Corporation is required to apply a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the evidence it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, the Company determined that a valuation allowance was not needed.\nConsistent with the Companys practice prior to the passage of the Tax Act, we do not currently take the position that undistributed foreign subsidiaries earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nA summary of the Companys adjustments to its uncertain tax positions, included within long-term accrued income taxes on the consolidated balance sheet, in fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nBalance, at beginning of the year\n$\n1,820\n$\n2,190\n$\n1,941\nIncrease for tax positions related to the current year\n-\nDecreases for currency translation adjustments\n(71)\n-\nIncrease (decrease) for tax positions related to prior years\n-\n1,180\nDecreases for settlement of uncertain tax positions\n(30)\n-\n(705)\nIncrease for interest and penalties\nDecrease for lapses of statute of limitations\n(495)\n(434)\nBalance, at end of year\n$\n1,895\n$\n1,820\n$\n2,190\nThe unrecognized tax benefits mentioned above include an aggregate of $619 of accrued interest and penalty balances related to uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. An increase in accrued interest and penalty charges of approximately $35, net of Federal tax expense, was recorded as a tax expense during the current fiscal year. The Company anticipates that its accrual for uncertain tax positions could change by approximately $510 over the next twelve-month period due to statute of limitations expiration.\nThe Company is subject to U.S. Federal income tax, as well as to income tax of multiple state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for all material U.S. Federal, state, and local tax filings remains open for fiscal years subsequent to 2019.

The Company has a funded, qualified plan (Qualified Plan) and an unfunded supplemental plan (Supplemental Plan) designed to maintain benefits for certain employees at the plan formula level. The plans provide for pension benefits determined by a participants years of service and final average compensation. The Qualified Plan assets consist of separate pooled investment accounts with a trust company. The measurement date for the plans is August 31, 2023.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nEffective December 1, 2008, a soft freeze in the Qualified Plan was adopted whereby no new employees hired would be admitted to the Qualified Plan, with the exception of employees who were members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union whose contract was amended in June 2012 to include a soft freeze with an effective date of July 15, 2012.

The Moodys Corporate Aa Bond index has generally been used as a benchmark for this purpose, with adjustments made if the duration of the index differed from that of the plan. The discount rate is determined by matching the expected payouts from the respective plans to the spot rates inherent in the FTSE Pension Discount Curve (formerly Citigroup Pension Discount Curve). A single rate is then developed, that when applied to the expected cash flows, results in the same present value as determined using the various spot rates. The Company believes that this approach produces the most appropriate approximation of the plan liability.\nThe Company estimates that each 100-basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in additional (decreased) net periodic pension cost, the Companys primary pension obligation, of approximately $67 for the Qualified Plan and ($21) for the Supplemental Plan. The expected return on plan assets is derived from a periodic study of long-term historical rates of return on the various asset classes included in the Companys targeted pension plan asset allocation. The Company estimates that each 100-basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional net periodic pension cost of approximately $48 for the Qualified Plan. No rate of return is assumed for the Supplemental Plan since that plan is currently not funded. The rate of compensation increase is also evaluated and is adjusted by the Company, if necessary, periodically.\nQualified Plan Assets\nThe investment policy for the Qualified Plan is based on ERISA standards for prudent investing. The fundamental goal underlying the investment policy is to ensure that the assets of the plans are invested in a prudent manner to meet the obligations of the plans as these obligations come due. The primary investment objectives include providing a total return which will promote the goal of benefit security by attaining an appropriate ratio of plan assets to plan obligations, to provide for real asset growth while also tracking plan obligations, to diversify investments across and within asset classes, to reduce the impact of losses in single investments, and to follow investment practices that comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nThe primary policy objectives will be met by investing assets to achieve a reasonable tradeoff between return and risk relative to the plans obligations. This includes investing a portion of the assets in funds selected in part to hedge the interest rate sensitivity to plan obligations.\nThe Qualified Plan assets are invested in a diversified mix of both domestic and foreign equity investments and fixed income securities. Asset manager performance is reviewed at least annually and benchmarked against the peer universe for the given investment style. The Companys expected return for the Qualified Plan is 6.65%. To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the assets for the Qualified Plan, the Company considered the historical and expected return on the plan assets, as well as the current and expected allocation of the plan assets.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nAsset allocation is monitored on an ongoing basis relative to the established asset class targets. The interaction between plan assets and benefit obligations is periodically studied to assist in the establishment of strategic asset allocation targets. The investment policy permits variances from the targets within certain parameters. Asset rebalancing occurs when the underlying asset class allocations move outside these parameters, at which time the asset allocation is rebalanced back to the policy target weight.\nThe Qualified Plan has the following target allocation and weighted average asset allocations as of August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\nTarget\nAllocation\nPercentage of Plan Assets as of August 31,\nAsset Category\nRange\nEquity securities\n10-80\n%\n%\n%\n%\nDebt securities\n20-75\n%\n%\n%\n%\nOther\n0-100\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\n%\nFair Market Value of Pension Plan Assets\nThe Company is required to categorize pension plan assets using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the inputs used in measuring fair values.

The Company recorded transaction costs of $29 and $4,000 as of August 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, related to this acquisition which are excluded from the purchase price. Acquisition-related costs consist of legal and professional fees related to the NuCera acquisition.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nThe NuCera acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, (ASC 805). The purchase price consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of NuCera based upon their fair values as of the acquisition date. Fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, (ASC 820), using the discounted cash flows and other applicable valuation techniques. For certain assets and liabilities, those fair values are consistent with historical carrying values.\nRefer to the table summarizing the purchase consideration and the purchase price allocation to estimate fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in thousands).\nAllocation of the Purchase Price\nPurchase Price Allocation\nAmount\nCash consideration\n$\n250,092\nTotal fair value of consideration transferred\n250,092\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\nAccounts receivable\n10,392\nInventory\n16,062\nPrepaid and other current assets\n4,848\nProperty, plant & equipment\n38,292\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nGoodwill\n81,482\nIntangible assets\n148,021\nOther assets\nTotal assets acquired\n300,386\nLiabilities assumed:\nAccounts payable\n$\n4,731\nAccrued expenses\n6,644\nIncome taxes payable\nOperating lease long-term liabilities\nDeferred income taxes\n38,179\nAccrued income taxes\nTotal liabilities assumed\n50,294\nNet assets acquired\n$\n250,092\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nThe purchase price allocation resulted in goodwill of $81,482 of which $1,147 is deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities representing the estimated economic value attributable to future operations\nUnder the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, if we identified changes to acquired deferred tax asset valuation allowances or liabilities related to uncertain tax positions during the measurement period, and they are related to new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, those changes are considered a measurement-period adjustment, and we record the offset to goodwill. The Company recorded all other changes to deferred tax asset valuation allowances and liabilities related to uncertain tax positions in current-period income tax expense. This accounting applies to all of our acquisitions, regardless of acquisition date.\nThe revenue and net loss for the results of operations for NuCera was $69,669 and ($11,850) for the year-to-date period of fiscal 2023.\nThe pro forma summary below presents the results of operations as if the NuCera acquisition occurred on September 1, 2021. Proforma adjustments for the twelve months ended August 31, 2022 includes $15,068 of incremental amortization expense from acquired intangible assets, $2,242 of inventory step-up, $8,910 of incremental interest expense, and the tax related impact. The pro forma summary uses estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. Management believes the estimates and assumptions to be reasonable; however, actual results may have differed significantly from this pro forma financial information. The pro forma information does not reflect any cost savings, operating synergies or revenue enhancements that might have been achieved from combining the operations.

(ETi)\nOn February 5, 2021, the Company acquired certain assets of Emerging Technologies, Inc. (ETi), a superabsorbent polymers solutions provider, located in Greensboro, NC. The business was acquired for a purchase price of $9,997, comprising $8,997 paid on February 5, 2021 and $1,000 paid on August 4, 2022 (eighteen months after the purchase), subsequent to final working capital adjustments, and excluding acquisition-related costs. As part of this transaction, Chase acquired substantially all working capital and fixed assets of the business and entered a multi-year lease at ETis existing location. The Company expensed $128 of acquisition-related costs in fiscal 2021 associated with this acquisition. The purchase was funded with available cash on hand. ETi is a solutions provider and formulator of absorbent polymers for use in the packaging, recreational, consumer, and sanitation markets. The acquisition broadens the Companys superabsorbent polymers product offerings and formulation capabilities while expanding its market reach. The Company finalized purchase accounting during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, with no significant change to amounts initially recorded. Since the effective date of the acquisition, the financial results of ETis acquired operations have been included in the Companys financial statements within the functional additives product line, contained within the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives operating segment. The ETi acquisition does not represent a significant business combination so pro forma financial information is not provided.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nThe excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired resulted in goodwill of $2,451 that is largely attributable to the synergies and economies of scale from combining the operations, technologies and research and development capabilities of ETi and Chase, particularly as they pertain to the expansion of the Company's product and service offerings, the established workforce and marketing efforts.

The Company accrued $3,538 and $2,584 at August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet related to its current estimate of the earn out. Following its initial recording at the acquisition date, a $702, $432 and $1,664 increase in the performance-based earn out accrual was recorded within Loss on contingent consideration in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

This revenue is generated from the manufacture of specialty chemical products including coatings, linings, adhesives, sealants, specialty tapes, polymers and laminates. Certain of these manufactured products can incorporate customer-owned materials. The Company also recognizes, to a lesser extent, revenue through royalties and commissions from licensed manufacturers and from providing custom manufacturing-related services. The Companys revenue recognition policies require the Company to make significant judgments and estimates. In applying the Companys revenue recognition policy, determinations must be made as to when control of products passes to the Companys customers, which can be either at a point in time or over time based on contractual terms with customers. Revenue is generally recognized at a point in time when control passes upon either shipment to or receipt by the customer of the Companys products, while revenue is generally recognized over time when control of the Companys products transfers to customers during the manufacturing process. The Company analyzes several factors, including but not limited to, the nature of the products being sold and contractual terms and conditions in contracts with customers to help the Company make such judgments about revenue recognition.\nContract Balances\nThe Companys contract assets primarily relate to unbilled revenue for products currently in production at the Companys facilities and which incorporate customer-owned material. Revenue is recognized in advance of billing to the customer in these specific circumstances, whereas billing is typically performed at the time of shipment to or receipt by the customer. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The following table presents contract assets by reportable operating segment as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nAugust 31,\nAugust 31,\nContract Assets\nAdhesives, Sealants and Additives\n$\n$\nIndustrial Tapes\nCorrosion Protection and Waterproofing\nTotal\n$\n$\nThe Company did not have any contract liabilities as of August 31, 2023 and 2022.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nDisaggregated Revenue\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from customers by geographic region, as it believes this disclosure best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company's revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.

Shipping and handling expenses consist primarily of costs incurred to deliver products to customers and internal costs related to preparing products for shipment and are recorded within cost of products and services sold. Amounts billed to customers as shipping and handling are classified as revenue when services are performed.\nConsidering Existence of a Significant Financing Component - as a practical expedient, an entity need not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to the customer and\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nwhen the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less. Given the time between the Company transferring a promised good or service to the customer and the customer paying for that good or service is less than one year based on the terms of arrangements with customers, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for effects of a significant financing component.\nNote 16-Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The Company uses a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which classifies the inputs used in measuring fair values. These tiers are: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe Company utilizes the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The financial assets classified as Level 1 and Level 2 as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 represent investments that are restricted for use in nonqualified retirement savings plans for certain key employees and directors.\nThe following table sets forth the Companys financial assets that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFair value measurement category\nQuoted prices\nSignificant other\nSignificant\nFair value\nin active markets\nobservable inputs\nunobservable inputs\nmeasurement date\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nAssets:\nRestricted investments\nAugust 31, 2023\n$\n2,938\n$\n2,704\n$\n$\n-\nRestricted investments\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n2,367\n$\n2,125\n$\n$\n-\nThe following table presents the fair value of the Companys liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of August 31, 2023 and 2022:\nFair value measurement category\nQuoted prices\nSignificant other\nSignificant\nFair value\nin active markets\nobservable inputs\nunobservable inputs\nmeasurement date\nTotal\n(Level 1)\n(Level 2)\n(Level 3)\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt\nAugust 31, 2023\n$\n105,000\n$\n-\n$\n105,000\n$\n-\nContingent consideration\nAugust 31, 2023\n$\n3,538\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n3,538\nLong-term debt\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n180,000\n$\n-\n$\n180,000\n$\n-\nContingent consideration\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n2,584\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n2,584\nThe long-term debt (including any current portion of long-term debt) had a $105,000 and $180,000 balance as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The carrying value of the long-term debt approximates its fair value and has an interest rate of 6.43% as of August 31, 2023. The interest rate is set based on the movement of the underlying market rates. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on long-term debt.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nIn connection with accounting for the ABchimie acquisition on September 1, 2020, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability included within Other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet of \u20ac780 (approximately $928) on the acquisition date, representing the then fair value of contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of a performance-based target. The contingent consideration liability was valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model in an option pricing framework based on key inputs that are not all observable in the market, which represents a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The Company assesses the fair value of the contingent consideration liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in Loss on contingent consideration on the consolidated statement of operations until the liability is settled. As of August 31, 2023, the liability increased to $3,538 predominantly due to changes in non-market data assumptions as well as a shorter period to the payment date. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the acquisition of ABchimie.\nNote 17-Net Income Per Share\nThe determination of earnings per share under the two-class method is as follows:\nYears Ended August 31,\nNet income\n$\n33,182\n$\n44,671\n$\n44,920\nLess: Allocated to participating securities\nAvailable to common shareholders\n$\n32,908\n$\n44,374\n$\n44,611\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding\n9,424,729\n9,399,085\n9,383,085\nAdditional dilutive common stock equivalents\n33,887\n35,256\n45,331\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n9,458,616\n9,434,341\n9,428,416\nNet income available to common shareholders, per common and common equivalent share\nBasic\n$\n3.49\n$\n4.72\n$\n4.75\nDiluted\n$\n3.48\n$\n4.70\n$\n4.73\nFor the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock options to purchase 78,562, 96,912 and 59,508 shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but were not included in the calculation of diluted net income per share because their inclusion would be antidilutive.

This upgrade will position us with a more advanced system to support business expansion, access to upgrades in functionality and a more modern system for operations. Additionally, the upgrade will be a multi-year, phased-in approach designed to mitigate any disruptions to our business. The Company recognized $1,476 in operations optimization expense related to the ERP system upgrade in fiscal 2023.\nRelocation of Adhesives Systems Manufacturing to O'Hara Township, PA\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase announced to the employees at its Woburn, MA location that its adhesives systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segments electronic and industrial coatings product line, would be consolidating into the Companys existing O'Hara Township, PA location. This rationalization and consolidation initiative-related announcement aligns with the second quarter announcement of the Companys plan to move its sealant systems production from Newark, CA to Hickory, NC, described in more detail below. Chase Corporation obtained both the adhesive and sealants systems as part of its fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs.\nThe Company expensed $516, $463 and $0 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, related to the move. The project was completed in fiscal 2023 and no future costs related to this move are anticipated.\nRelocation of Sealants Systems Manufacturing to Hickory, NC\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021, Chase began moving the sealant systems operations, part of the Adhesives, Sealants and Additives segments electronic and industrial coatings product line, from its Newark, CA location to its Hickory, NC facility. This is in line with the Companys ongoing initiative to consolidate its manufacturing plants and streamline its existing processes. The sealant systems operations and Newark, CA location came to Chase Corporation as part of the fiscal 2017 acquisition of the operations of Resin Designs, and the Companys lease in Newark, CA terminated in fiscal 2021.\nThe Company recognized $0, $147 and $977 in operations optimization expense related to the move in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The project was completed in fiscal 2022 and no future costs related to the move are anticipated.\nRelocation of Chase Corporate Headquarters\nThe Company completed the relocation of its corporate headquarters to another location within Westwood, MA during the year ended August 31, 2022. The move, part of the Companys ongoing consolidation and optimization initiative, capitalizes on the hybrid work model utilized by many of Chases corporate and administrative employees and is expected to provide future operational cost savings. The new facility also consolidates and houses research and development operations previously conducted at the previous Westwood, MA and Woburn, MA locations.\nThe company recognized $0 and $232 in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, in operations optimization costs related to the Westwood move. The project was completed in fiscal 2022 and no future costs related to the move are anticipated.\nCHASE CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn thousands, except share and per share amounts\nNote 20-Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to the conduct of its business. Although the Company does not expect that the outcome in any of these matters, individually or collectively, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, litigation is inherently unpredictable. Therefore, judgments could be rendered, or settlements agreed to, that could adversely affect the Companys operating results or cash flows in a particular period. The Company routinely assesses all of its litigation and threatened litigation as to the probability of ultimately incurring a liability and records its best estimate of the ultimate loss in situations where it assesses the likelihood of loss as probable.\nNote 21-Valuation and Qualifying Accounts\nThe following table sets forth activity in the Companys accounts receivable and sales return reserve:\nYear ended\nBalance at\nBeginning of\nYear\nCharges to\nOperations\nDeductions to\nReserves\nBalance at\nEnd of Year\nAugust 31, 2023 (1)\n$\n$\n2,967\n$\n(2,744)\n$\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n$\n$\n(794)\n$\nAugust 31, 2021\n$\n$\n$\n(738)\n$\n(1) The increase in charges to operations for the year ended August 31, 2023 primarily relate to the addition of NuCera (including $1,300 of current year sales returns and $90 related to the opening balance adjustment).\nThe following table sets forth activity in the Companys warranty reserve (the warranty reserve is included within accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet):\nYear ended\nBalance at\nBeginning of\nYear\nCharges to\nOperations\nDeductions to\nReserves\nBalance at\nEnd of Year\nAugust 31, 2023\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nAugust 31, 2022\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nAugust 31, 2021\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\nNote 22 - Subsequent Event\nOther than disclosed in Note 14, there are no subsequent events.

Item 9a - Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nThe Company carries out a variety of ongoing procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companys management, including the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2023. Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Company implemented financial internal controls on the operations associated with NuCera, acquired in September 2022, during the year-to-date fiscal 2023 period.\nOther than the foregoing, there have not been any changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nChase Corporation\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Chase Corporation (a Massachusetts corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended August 31, 2023, and our report dated November 9, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Item 11 - Executive Compensation\nExecutive Officer and Director Compensation - Compensation Discussion and Analysis\nIntroduction\nThis Compensation Discussion and Analysis is intended to provide a context for the disclosures contained with respect to the compensation paid to our executive officers. Compensation information is presented below for our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, our Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, Michael J. Bourque and our General Counsel, Jeffery D. Haigh. Collectively, these officers are referred to as our named executive officers. Specifically, this Compensation Discussion and Analysis will explain the objectives and material elements of their compensation during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023.\nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors has the responsibility of developing and overseeing a comprehensive compensation philosophy, with strategies and principles that have the support of the Board of Directors and management, and that ensure the fair and consistent administration of our compensation program. The Compensation and Management Development Committee makes recommendations to the full Board for approval relative to the total compensation to be paid to the named executive officers, including salary, performance bonus, equity awards, long-term awards, benefits, and perquisites.\nThe members of the committee are Thomas Wroe, Jr., Chairman, Thomas D. DeByle, and John H. Derby III. Each member of the committee is independent, as independence for Compensation and Management Development Committee members is defined under the listing standards of the NYSE American and the applicable regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Compensation and Management Development Committee operates under a written charter that is available through the Companys website at www.chasecorp.com.\nIn this analysis, we refer to the Compensation and Management Development Committee as the Committee or the Compensation and Management Development Committee.\nPhilosophy and Objectives of Our Compensation Program\nThe primary objectives of the Compensation and Management Development Committee are to ensure that our executive compensation and benefits programs:\n\u25cf\nretain executive talent by offering compensation that is commensurate with pay at other public companies of a similar size in the same or similar industries in the region, as adjusted for individual factors, and considering the complexity of the Companys business;\n\u25cfsafeguard company interests and the interests of our shareholders;\n\u25cf\nare effective in driving executive performance by having, for members of the senior management team, pay at risk, so actual pay is tied to company-wide goal achievement and superior performance is rewarded;\n\u25cffoster teamwork on the part of management;\n\u25cfare consistent and competitive with Chase Corporations compensation peer group;\n\u25cfare cost-efficient and fair to employees, management, and shareholders; and\n\u25cfare well-communicated to and understood by program participants.\nOur Compensation and Management Development Committee believes that the most effective compensation program is one that will provide incentives that are directly linked to the achievement of company strategies through easily measured, company-wide performance targets, while providing a reasonable level of income security to the named executive officers through competitive base salaries and retirement benefits. Our executive compensation reflects a balance of cash and non-cash compensation, and a mix of currently paid compensation and long-term incentives. The Compensation and Management Development Committee does not set a rigid target for these mixes, and the mix will necessarily vary from year to year based upon our underlying financial performance. Our incentive plans combine financial targets to reward performance with time-based vesting to assist retention.\nCommittee Purposes and Responsibilities\nOne of the primary purposes of the Compensation and Management Development Committee is to determine the total target compensation levels for the senior executive officers of the Company and to establish and annually review the programs that will determine the actual rewards as compared to established targets.\nThe Committee is charged with ensuring that the target compensation levels, and the allocation of short-term and long-term components are sufficient to attract, motivate, and retain seasoned professional managers, while at the same time ensuring that the pay is reasonable and fair to our shareholders in light of the Companys financial performance and when compared to executive officers of similar position and responsibility at comparable businesses.\nThe Committee is also responsible for reviewing the annual compensation for service on the Board of Directors or for service as a member or chair of any of the various committees of the Board of Directors, and, when appropriate, recommending any changes to the Board for approval.\nThe Committee has the authority to retain and terminate any legal counsel or any compensation or other consultant to be used to assist in the evaluation of director or executive compensation and has sole authority to approve the consultants fees or other retention terms.\nThe Committee also reviews and administers our equity compensation plans, and reviews any existing or proposed employment agreement, change in control or severance agreement, or any special or supplemental benefits not offered as part of a broad-based plan that are made available to our named executive officers. Where appropriate, it recommends adoption, amendment, or termination of such programs or agreements to the full Board of Directors.\nRole of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions\nOur Compensation and Management Development Committee makes all determinations affecting the compensation for our named executive officers, including our Executive Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer, and recommends those determinations to the full Board of Directors for approval. Our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer may from time-to-time attend meetings of the Committee as non-voting advisory members, except that they are not present for any discussion of their own compensation. The Compensation and Management Development Committee receives and considers our Executive Chairmans and our Chief Executive Officers evaluations of, and their recommendations as to all elements of compensation of, our Chief Financial Officer and our General Counsel. The Committee expressly reserves the right to exercise its discretion in modifying any adjustments or awards recommended by our Executive Chairman or our Chief Executive Officer, although historically the Committee has given significant weight to these recommendations.\nUse of Compensation Consultants and Benchmarking Data\nA description of the extent to which we have historically benchmarked our base salary levels against other companies is described below under Principal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program - Base Salary. The Committee has taken advice from expert compensation consultants to set the position values and salary ranges for executive officers. The Committee adjusts base salaries annually for the Company to remain competitive with respect to executive compensation. The compensation consultants have used similar benchmarking data in recommending the performance-based components of the executive compensation package. The Committee most recently engaged a compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer & Partners (Pearl Meyer) in August 2022 for benchmarking purposes in fiscal 2023. Pearl Meyer provided the Committee and management with recommendations based on its review at that time. Prior to this most recent engagement, the Company had last hired Pearl Meyer to perform a similar assessment in 2017.\nPrincipal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program\nThe principal elements of compensation for our named executive officers, other than our Executive Chairman, during fiscal 2023 were:\n\u25cfbase salary;\n\u25cf\na cash bonus component based on the performance of our business against corporate objectives under our annual cash incentive plan;\n\u25cflong term incentive compensation in the form of equity awards including:\n\u25cf\na restricted stock award based on the performance of our business against different corporate objectives (representing 50% of the total equity component target value);\n\u25cf\na time-based vesting restricted stock award (representing 25% of the total equity component target value); and\n\u25cf\nstock options (representing 25% of the total equity component target value).\nIn fiscal year 2017 the Committee determined that Peter R. Chase, our Executive Chairman, would not participate in the cash incentive program component of the Companys executive compensation programs. This shift in the allocation of annual pay components for Peter R. Chase away from the cash incentive program reflected a shift in the day-to-day responsibilities of the Executive Chairman following Adam P. Chases appointment to the Chief Executive Officer role in fiscal 2015. Peter R. Chase has not participated in the Companys equity incentive programs since 2013, in recognition by the Committee of the diminishing incremental benefit of additional equity grants in achieving the shareholder alignment and retention objectives of the equity program considering Mr. Chases accumulation of equity from prior years of service. The Executive Chairmans compensation for fiscal 2023, therefore, consisted primarily of his salary, as it had in the prior six years.\nFor our named executive officers other than the Executive Chairman, the financial measurement metrics and targets used in both the annual cash incentive plan and the annual equity award plan are subject to annual review by the Committee, which reserves the right to set different objectives on either the cash incentive plan or equity award program as it feels appropriate considering the annual and long-term objectives of the Company. As discussed in more detail below, the Committee utilizes differing financial performance targets for the cash incentive plan and the equity awards program. The two programs also differ in the dollar value of the target awards and in their vesting provisions, since payments under the cash incentive plan are made after the end of each fiscal year, and the equity awards (including those that are subject to additional performance-based vesting criteria) customarily vest over a period of three years from the time of grant. The total compensation packages for our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and General Counsel thus provide a mix of (1) current cash payments in the form of salary, independent of year-to-year financial performance; (2) annual cash payments determined by reference to the Companys actual results of operations for the\nyear compared to a target; and (3) equity awards, subject (in the case of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) to vesting provisions relating to the Companys financial results, together with restricted stock and stock options that are not specifically tied to financial performance, but all of which are subject to time-based vesting provisions in order to foster our retention objectives.\nThe cash incentive plan for fiscal 2023 set target compensation levels with reference to targeted earnings before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as adjusted to exclude costs and gains or losses related to our acquisitions and divestitures, costs of products sold related to inventory step-up to fair value, settlement gains or losses resulting from lump sum distributions to participants in our defined benefit plans, and other significant items (Adjusted EBITDA), less the effects of foreign transaction gains or loss (Adjusted EBITDAX or the Adjusted EBITDA-based target). The performance-based equity award program sets target compensation levels with respect to a combination of (1) our earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year in question, as adjusted at the discretion of the Committee, and (2) our return on invested capital (ROIC) over a three-year period. Our calculation of each such metric under both plans is described in more detail below. As a result, a substantial proportion of our named executive officers total compensation under both the cash and equity incentive programs is tied to our earnings in each fiscal year. The Committee determined for 2023 that an Adjusted EBITDA-based target is the most appropriate tool for measuring the underlying performance of the Company and its management team for the annual cash incentive plan, while EPS and ROIC are used for the equity plan as they are more common and consistent measures for longer term incentive programs and align with how shareholders are rewarded. In addition, the Committee has chosen to emphasize company-wide achievement of financial objectives in this manner, as opposed to emphasizing more subjective individual performance criteria or measurements based upon business segments or other operating data, because it believes it is important to use a metric that is easily measured and understood from the beginning of the year, that fosters teamwork among the management team, and that most directly aligns the interest of the named executive officers participating in the program with those of all shareholders. The Committee does retain discretion to adjust or supplement the cash incentive awards paid, either upward or downward.\nThe following discussion seeks to explain why the Compensation and Management Development Committee has chosen to pay each compensation element, how it determines the amount of each element, and how the element and the Committees decisions regarding that element in fiscal 2023 fit into the Companys overall compensation objectives and affect decisions regarding other elements.\nBase Salary. Each of our named executive officers receives a base salary. The objective is to provide base compensation comparable to base compensation that the executive could earn in a similar position at other companies. To better understand the compensation practices of similar companies, the Compensation and Management Development Committee from time to time, reviews data from a custom peer group. The peer group used for benchmarking 2023 salary ranges was identified by our compensation consultant, Pearl Meyer, in 2022. Peer group information serves as the primary reference point for the Compensation and Management Development Committee with Pearl Meyer market survey data used as a secondary reference in attempting to keep salary ranges competitive.\nThe following companies comprised of our peer group for fiscal 2023:\n\u25cf Balchem Corporation\n\u25cf CSW Industrials, Inc.\n\u25cf FutureFuel Corp.\n\u25cf GCP Applied Technologies Inc,\n\u25cf Hawkins, Inc.\n\u25cf Insteel Insutries, Inc.\n\u25cf Livent Corporation\n\u25cf LSB Industries, Inc.\n\u25cf Quaker Chemical Corporation\n\u25cf Ramaco Resources, Inc.\n\u25cf Ranpak Holdings Corp.\n\u25cf Trecora Resources\n\u25cf UFP Technologies, Inc.\n\u25cf United States Lime & Minerals, Inc.\nThis peer group used for benchmarking was developed based on comparability to the Company in terms of industry and size, with data gathered from peer group proxy statements.\nCash Incentive Plan. At the beginning of each fiscal year, following the annual budget presentation by management to the Board of Directors, the Committee sets a corporate performance target for the upcoming fiscal year to be used in connection with the Companys incentive compensation programs. For the reasons discussed above, our Executive Chairman does not participate in the cash incentive plan. As noted above, for the cash incentive plan the financial target was established as an Adjusted EBITDA-based target for fiscal 2023. The Adjusted EBITDA-based target was set by the Committee with reference to both historical performance and expected future performance. The Committee believes that the targets set as a general matter should be reasonably attainable through consistent performance as compared to recent years, and it is the Committees expectation that the actual awards granted under the relevant plan will exceed the target awards where management achieves growth over historical annual Adjusted EBITDAX levels. The Adjusted EBITDA-based targets are set in a way that tends to generally reflect improvement over historical results, at least during periods of multi-year growth in Adjusted EBITDAX.\nAt the end of the fiscal year, actual results are compared to the target established at the beginning of the year. In establishing the compensation program, it is the Boards intent to exclude from actual performance measurements the effect of items generally consistent with items excluded in the Companys historical definition of Adjusted EBITDA. The Committee consequently has the discretion to decide and has decided from time to time in the past, to exclude certain items or to make other adjustments in order to fairly reflect our underlying operating performance for the year.\nIn order for any amounts to be payable under the plan, the Company must meet a threshold level of 80% of the Adjusted EBITDA-based target for any amounts to be paid as part of the plan. Actual payments are made under the plan by reference to the target awards established by the Committee for each of the named executive officers as a percentage of their base salaries, although they can be subject to adjustment as described below. The maximum award under the cash incentive plan is reached at 120% of the target performance measure. The Companys actual Adjusted EBITDAX was $96.8 million for fiscal 2023 and represented achievement at approximately 81% of the target amount for the year, resulting in the payout of 52.25% of the target award under the cash incentive plan.\nThe reconciliation from net income, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to Adjusted EBITDAX for fiscal 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended August 31,\nNet income\n$\n33,182\n$\n44,671\nInterest expense\n8,981\nIncome taxes\n10,009\n13,927\nDepreciation expense\n8,906\n3,547\nAmortization expense\n23,666\n11,751\nEBITDA(1)\n$\n84,744\n$\n74,321\nLoss on contingent consideration\nOperations optimization costs\n1,992\nAcquisition-related costs\n4,299\n4,000\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n2,242\n-\nPension settlement loss\n-\nLoss on impairment/write-off of long-term assets\n1,689\n-\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)\n$\n95,881\n$\n79,595\nForeign transaction (gains) losses\n(442)\nAdjusted EBITDAX\n$\n96,842\n$\n79,153\n(1) Our calculations of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP financial measures, are explained in greater detail in our cautionary note on Form 10-K.

In fiscal 2023, approximately 584 employees participated in that program, with most payments at the discretion of the Executive Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer.\nEquity Incentive Plan. The third element of our compensation program is our equity-based long-term incentive plan. In 2023 our equity incentive plan used a combination of three types of equity awards: performance-based restricted stock, time-vesting restricted stock, and stock options. For the reasons discussed above, Peter R. Chase does not participate in the equity incentive plan.\nThe performance-based element measures annual performance against (1) an earnings per share (EPS) base target and (2) a return on invested capital (ROIC) base target (weighted 80% and 20%, respectively, of the total performance-based equity award target value for 2023). The performance-based equity award target represented 50% of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh for 2023. The other half of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh was split evenly between time-based vesting restricted stock and stock options.\nThe following table shows, for each of the named executive officers participating in the equity incentive plan, the total target equity awards for each officer as determined at the beginning of the fiscal year.\nTarget Equity\nPerformance\nTime Vesting\nAward as % of\nValue at\nShares at\nShares at\nStock Options at\nName\nSalary (1)\nGrant Date\nGrant Date (2)\nGrant Date (3)\nGrant Date (4)\nAdam P.

Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh assuming achievement at 100% of the performance targets, using the closing share price on the last day of the prior fiscal year. Based upon actual fiscal 2023 financial performance, the total actual payout for the performance share component of the equity compensation plan for fiscal 2023 was 1,124 shares for Adam P. Chase, 150 shares for Michael J. Bourque and 96 shares for Jeffery D. Haigh due to achieving below the performance target, calculated in the manner described under Performance-based restricted stock below. Consequently, 7553, 1010, and 647 stock awards from the original performance grants were forfeited by Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively, subsequent to August 31, 2023.\n(3)\nValue represents 25% of the total equity award targets for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh using the closing share price on the last day of the prior fiscal year.\n(4)\nValue represents 25% of the total equity award for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh, using the Black-Scholes value of the options on the last day of the prior fiscal year.\nIn the event of a named executive officers retirement, death, disability, or dismissal without cause before the scheduled vesting date, the awards will vest pro rata to the date of the termination of employment. In the event of a named executive officers voluntary termination of employment or termination for cause, all unvested portions of the award will be forfeited. Upon a change of control of the Company, any unvested restricted stock awards will automatically vest, and any unvested stock options may vest at the discretion of the Committee.\nEach of the three types of equity awards that collectively comprise our equity incentive plan are described in more detail below:\nPerformance-based restricted stock. The performance-based restricted stock awards are made at the beginning of the year based upon the target performance levels, with the target number of shares being determined by dividing the target equity award value by our stock price on the grant date. For fiscal 2023, the EPS target set by the Committee was $5.97 and the ROIC target set by the Committee was 21.4%.\nThe final award amounts are determined after the end of the fiscal year by reference to our actual performance for the year. For any payments to be made under the EPS component or the ROIC component of the equity incentive plan, the Company must achieve at least 80% of the EPS target or the ROIC target, as applicable. The EPS target was weighted as 80% of the target performance-based equity award, and the ROIC target was weighted as 20% of the target performance-based equity award. If the Company achieves less than 80% of both performance targets, the full award would be forfeited. If the Company achieves 80% of either of the targets, then the actual payment would be 50% of the target shares available under that target (with the other 50% being forfeited). Achievement between 80% and 100% of either target would be pro-rated. If the Company achieves 120% of either target, then the executives equity award would be 200% of the targeted share amount available under that target. Achievement between 100% and 120% of either target would be pro-rated. The total opportunity is capped at 200% of the targeted share amount. Accordingly, there is no incremental award in 2023 at performance levels above 120% of either target.\nEPS as defined in the plan may differ from earnings per share as calculated under generally accepted accounting principles, since the plan uses the fully diluted number of shares outstanding as of the first day of the fiscal year and may include other adjustments as determined by the Compensation and Management Development Committee. Our basic and diluted EPS as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for fiscal 2023 were $3.49 and $3.48 per share, respectively. Using the fully diluted number of shares outstanding as of August 31, 2022, the EPS used for purposes of evaluating performance under the 2023 equity plan was $3.52, or less than the 80% threshold of the target EPS of $5.97. The actual payments made under the EPS performance share component of the plan thus represented 0% of the targeted share amount for that component due to being under the 80% threshold of the target EPS of $5.97.\nROIC is defined in the plan as the three-year average earnings before interest expense and income tax, divided by the three-year average of the sum of equity and debt less cash on hand at year-end. The fiscal 2023 target was set as the trailing three-year average ROIC, calculated using the fiscal 2023 budget and fiscal 2022 and 2021 actual results. Actual ROIC for the measurement period was calculated using actual results for the three years ended August 31, 2023. The ROIC used for purposes of evaluating performance under the 2023 equity plan was 18.4%, or approximately 86% of the target ROIC of 21.4%. The actual payments made under the ROIC performance share component of the plan thus represented approximately 64.75% of the targeted share amount for that component.\nThe final share amounts are calculated and approved by the Compensation and Management Development Committee upon finalization of our financial results for the fiscal year. Equity awards made for fiscal 2023 fell below the threshold for the EPS and between the threshold and target levels for ROIC. The restricted stock award under the plan will not vest until the last day of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year that is used as the performance period. In other words, the performance-based equity awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025.\nThe Committee believes that the combination of performance measures to determine the number of shares of common stock underlying each award, and the cliff vesting of the award two years after the end of the performance period, is useful in accomplishing the dual objectives of rewarding superior performance and encouraging retention of its qualified executives.\nTime-based vesting restricted stock. The Committee also incorporates time-based vesting shares into our long-term incentive plan for participating executive officers. The purpose of the time vesting restricted stock grant is to provide a long-term incentive in the form of a fixed award that is not subject to a performance measurement target. The number of shares is determined by reference to the value of the award (25% of the total target equity award value for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh) divided by the closing market price of our common stock on the last day of the prior fiscal year. The shares vest in three years from their grant, or on August 31, 2025.\nStock options. The Committee incorporates stock option grants into our long-term incentive plan on a formulaic basis as part of the overall long-term incentive plan for certain executive officers. Thus, 25% of the total target value of the equity plan awards for 2023 for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh, was made in options to purchase common stock. The purpose of the option grant was to further align the executives interests with that of the shareholders, to encourage equity participation among management team members and provide a long-term incentive for their future commitment as key members of the executive management team. The option grant was made effective as of\nSeptember 1, 2022, with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date. The number of shares of common stock subject to these option grants was determined by taking 25% of the total equity award opportunity and dividing it by the Black-Scholes value of an individual option on the date of grant. The options granted in fiscal 2023 will vest in three equal annual installments, beginning on August 31, 2023.\nDiscretionary Bonuses. The Committee does not consider discretionary cash bonuses to be a material part of the executive compensation program, outside of the cash incentive plan described above. As noted above, the Committee has the discretion to adjust an award determined under the cash incentive plan upward or downward and has exercised that discretion in the prior years in a manner that has historically had a small impact on total compensation compared to the objective components. No such adjustments were made with respect to the fiscal 2023 compensation program.\nVoting and Dividends on Stock Awards. Participants in the equity award program can vote and receive dividends upon their restricted shares before the shares vest. The Committee has determined that permitting the participants to vote and receive dividends prior to the vesting of the awards was appropriate and consistent with the Committees retention and pay for performance objectives. The Committee considered the fact that dividends on unvested awards would typically represent a small percentage of the executives total compensation. Dividends paid on unvested awards are not required to be repaid if the vesting provisions are not met, but the underlying shares themselves remain subject to forfeiture through the vesting date, putting the bulk of the economic value of the award at risk and subject to the performance and time-based vesting conditions.\nRetirement Programs\nIn addition to the primary components of executive pay described above, we maintain certain retirement plans and benefits for our executive officers. Many of these plans are available to larger groups of employees. The Committee feels that the opportunity to participate in programs that assist the executives and other employees in saving for retirement is an important part of those employees compensation package.\n\u25cf\nThe named executive officers may elect to make contributions to a retirement account in our Chase Deferred Salary Savings Plan (the 401(k) plan), which is available to substantially all employees of certain businesses of the Company and under which we made a matching contribution to each participant in each of the last three fiscal years. The matching contribution under the 401(k) plan is the equivalent of 100% of the first one percent of the employees pre-tax contribution to the plan plus 50% thereafter, up to an amount equal to three and one-half percent of the employees annual salary. Our matching contributions to the accounts of the named executive officers are shown in the All Other Compensation column in the Summary Compensation Table.\n\u25cf\nWe also maintain a non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan covering selected employees, including our named executive officers. Participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation for future payment in accordance with the terms of the plan. Our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, received a full payout of his non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan balance in fiscal 2017 after entering a separation of service letter with the Company, reducing the level of services that he performs as the Executive Chairman to no more than 20% of the average level of services performed in the previous 36 months.\n\u25cf\nWe maintain a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan. The Supplemental Pension Plan covers those of our employees who from time to time may be designated by our Board of Directors. During fiscal 2023, our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, and our President and Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, were designated as being covered. These plans are described in more detail under Executive Compensation-Other Executive Plans-Pension Plans. As noted in that section, benefits are paid at a higher rate to employees who became employed prior to May 1, 1995 or who are covered by certain collective bargaining agreements and meet certain other qualifications, as compared to those who were employed after that date. Our Executive Chairman, Peter R. Chase, began collecting his non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan balance in fiscal 2017 after entering a separation of service letter with the Company, as noted above.\nOther Benefits\nThe Company owns a life insurance policy on Peter R. Chase as a mechanism available for use to fund obligations of the Company, including the unfunded, non-qualified Supplemental Pension Plan described above.\nWe provide our named executive officers a car allowance of $1,000 per month. We provide our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and General Counsel with reimbursements for certain financial planning and tax services up to $5,000 per year. Our Compensation and Management Development Committee considers these arrangements to be fair and reasonable considering the relatively low cost to the Company.\nNamed executive officers may also participate in our medical and dental insurance offerings by electing to make payroll deductions designed to cover approximately 35% of the cost of these programs (with the company covering the other 65% of the cost). We also provide disability and life insurance coverage for our named executive officers and pay a portion of the related premiums.\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nThe Board of Directors believes that it is important to align the interests of our senior management and directors with those of our shareholders. As described above, the Committee takes this principle into account in designing the compensation programs in which our executive officers participate. The Board has established stock ownership guidelines that encourage the accumulation and retention of our common stock to further foster these objectives.\nOur current stock ownership guidelines are expressed as a multiple of base salary or, in the case of directors, a multiple of annual cash compensation. Under the guidelines, each of our Executive Chairman and our Chief Executive Officer are required to acquire and hold stock with a fair market value of at least five times base salary. For our Chief Financial Officer, the multiple is three times base salary, and for our General Counsel and other vice presidents, the multiple is one times base salary. Non-employee directors are required to acquire and hold stock with a fair market value of at least five times annual cash compensation. Directors are required to achieve compliance 36 months from the first election to the Board. Newly appointed executives and covered individuals who accept an appointment to a position requiring a higher retention level are required to comply with this policy within 36 months of their appointment (or 60 months in the case of vice presidents). Shares of stock subject to time-based vesting provisions count toward the ownership guidelines but shares subject to performance-based vesting conditions and shares underlying stock options do not count toward the ownership guidelines. The Compensation and Management Development Committee retains the discretion to grant waivers or make exceptions to the policy under appropriate circumstances.\nThe full stock ownership guidelines are available on our corporate website, www.chasecorp.com.\nProhibitions on Hedging and Pledging\nOur insider trading policy specifically prohibits Directors of Chase Corporation, officers, and selected other employees from (a) holding Company securities in a margin account or pledging Company securities as collateral for a loan, or (b) purchasing any financial instruments or entering into any other transactions that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of the Companys common stock owned directly or indirectly by them (commonly referred to as hedging) or entering into certain other speculative transactions.\nThis policy, referred to as the Chase Corporation Responsibilities and Requirements of Directors, Officers and Employees of a Publicly Held Company, is available on our corporate website, www.chasecorp.com.\nSeverance Agreements\nWe have arrangements with our named executive officers pursuant to which they would be entitled to receive severance upon certain enumerated events. The events that trigger payment are generally those related to termination of\nemployment without cause or detrimental changes in the executives terms and conditions of employment. See Payments Upon Termination or Change of Control below for a more detailed description of these triggering events and the resulting benefits. We believe that this structure will help: (i) assure that the named executive officers can give their full attention and dedication to us, free from distractions caused by personal uncertainties and risks related to a pending or threatened change in control, (ii) assure the named executives objectivity in considering shareholders interests, (iii) assure the named executives of fair treatment in case of involuntary termination following a change in control, and (iv) attract and retain key executive talent in a competitive market.\nConsideration of the Previous Shareholder Advisory Vote on Executive Compensation\nAt the Companys 2023 annual meeting of shareholders held February 7, 2023, approximately 89% of votes cast at the meeting with respect to the proposal were voted to approve, on an advisory basis, the compensation of our named executive officers. No specific component of our 2023 executive compensation program was altered based upon this voting result. However, the Committee will continue to monitor shareholder feedback as it reviews and establishes future executive compensation plans and determines awards for our named executive officers. Our Board of Directors determined in 2018 that an advisory vote will be conducted on an annual basis.\nCompensation Risks\nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee has considered the components of the Companys compensation policies and practices. We believe that risks arising from our compensation policies and practices for our employees, including our executive officers, are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, although a significant portion of executive compensation is performance based and at-risk, the Committee believes that the mix and design of the elements of executive compensation do not encourage management to assume excessive risk.\nThe Committee has reviewed the elements of executive compensation to determine whether any portion of executive compensation encourages excessive risk-taking. It concluded that:\n\u25cf\nthe Companys significant weighting toward long-term incentive compensation, including performance targets and time-based vesting provisions used in tandem, discourages excessive risk taking;\n\u25cf\nthe Companys performance goals are appropriately identified in order to avoid targets that, if not met, result in a large percentage loss of compensation;\n\u25cf\nassuming achievement of at least a minimum level of performance, payouts under the Companys performance-based plans result in some compensation at levels below full target achievement, rather than an all or nothing approach; and\n\u25cf\nas a manufacturing company, the Company is not generally subject to the types of risks that may be present in a corporation involved in financial services, trading, or investment activities.\nReport of the Compensation and Management Development Committee\nThe Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Chase Corporation Board of Directors has reviewed and discussed the foregoing Compensation Discussion and Analysis with management and based on such review and discussion we recommended to the Board of Directors that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Form 10-K.\nBy the Compensation and Management Development Committee\nThomas Wroe, Jr. (Chairman)\nThomas D.

Bourque joined the Company on February 2, 2021. Jeffery D. Haigh was promoted to Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary on the same date.\n(2)Salary includes amounts earned in the fiscal year, whether or not deferred.\n(3)\nAmounts under Stock Awards reflect the net grant date fair value of the stock-based incentive awards granted under our equity incentive program in the indicated fiscal year (and for fiscal 2022 also includes the restricted stock portion of our equity retention awards for Michael J. Bourque). For the portion of the award subject to performance-based conditions, the amount is based on the estimated probable outcome of the award as of the grant date. Amounts under Option Awards reflect the grant date fair value of stock options awarded during the fiscal year, including those granted in fiscal 2022 as equity retention awards to Michael J. Bourque. In each case, amounts are reported whether or not the award had vested and was recorded as compensation expense in accordance with the accounting for stock-based compensation guidance during the year. Assumptions made in the valuation are described in more detail in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023. Using the grant date fair value but assuming the maximum performance target under the stock-based incentive plan were met or exceeded, the amounts reported under Stock Awards for 2023 would have been approximately $1,912,000 for Adam P. Chase, $256,000 for Michael J. Bourque, $164,000 for Jeffery D. Haigh. The total compensation column for such officers in 2023 would have correspondingly been increased by approximately $765,000, $102,000 and $66,000 for Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively. Based on the financial results for fiscal 2023, the amount between the threshold\nand the target performance amount was achieved. The equity incentive program is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading Principal Elements of our Fiscal 2023 Compensation Program-Equity Incentive Plan.\n(4)\nThese amounts reflect incentive payments made under our annual cash incentive program earned during the applicable fiscal year and paid in November following the respective fiscal year end. The cash incentive program is described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis under the heading Principal Elements of our 2023 Compensation Program-Cash Incentive Plan.\n(5)\nRepresents the current year aggregate change in the actuarial present value of accumulated benefits under the qualified defined benefit plan and the supplemental pension plan as described under -Other Executive Plans-Pension Plans. Amounts for Peter R. Chase under this column are reported as zero under applicable SEC regulations because the aggregate change in actuarial present value of his accumulated benefits was a negative amount (a reduction of $1,389,868). This reflects a distribution of $1,554,708 from the supplemental pension plan during the year, as described in more detail under -Other Executive Plans-Pension Plans, net of an increase of $164,840 resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions from the prior year.\n(6)These amounts include all other compensation as described in the following table:\nQualified\nLife &\nAutomobile\n401(k) and\nLong-Term\nAllowance\nSupplemental\nDisability\nor Use of\nFiscal\nRetirement Plan\nInsurance\nCompany\nOther\nName\nYear\nContributions\nPremiums\nCar\n(a)\nTotal\nPeter R.

Below those performance levels, no payments would be made under the respective plans or plan components. It is possible that a lower share amount payout could be made if less than 80% of the target is achieved under one but not both EPS-based or ROIC-based performance targets, as occurred in 2023. The maximum payout under either the cash incentive plan or the performance-based equity award program is 200% of the target award. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors formally approved the equity awards on August 30, 2022. The grant date fair value of the possible equity awards reflects the fair value of our common stock on September 1, 2022, the first day of our fiscal year and the date on which awards were initially granted, multiplied by the total number of shares of restricted stock to be awarded assuming the target was met (assumed to be the probable outcome of the performance conditions at the initial grant date). The awards were paid in accordance with the plans upon finalization of our annual financial results and certification of the awards by the Compensation and Management Development Committee in November 2023. The actual results for fiscal year 2023 reflected achievement between threshold and target for the participating officers in the cash incentive plan. The actual results for fiscal year 2023 for the EPS based element of the performance-based equity award was below threshold and the ROIC-based element of the performance-based equity award was between threshold and target for the participating officers.\nOutstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year-End 2023\nThe following table sets forth information relating to options and unvested restricted stock outstanding as of August 31, 2023 that were granted pursuant to our Amended and Restated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan or predecessor plans to our named executive officers.\nStock Awards\nMarket\nOption Awards\nNumber of\nValue of\nNumber of\nNumber of\nShares or\nShares or\nSecurities\nSecurities\nUnits of\nUnits of\nUnderlying\nUnderlying\nOption\nStock That\nStock That\nUnexercised\nUnexercised\nExercise\nOption\nHave Not\nHave Not\nOptions\nOptions\nPrice\nExpiration\nVested\nVested\nName\n# Exercisable\n# Unexercisable\n($)\nDate\n(#)\n($)\nPeter R.

The stock option awards noted in the table above with September 2031 expiration dates vest in three equal annual tranches beginning August 31, 2022 through August 31, 2024. The stock option award noted in the table above with a February 2032 expiration date vest January 31, 2025. The stock option awards noted in the table above with September 2032 expiration date vest August 31, 2023 through August 31, 2025. Each such vesting date is subject to continued service requirements.\nAmounts under the Stock Awards columns reflect restricted stock issued under our equity incentive programs for fiscal 2023 and 2022, and our Chief Financial Officers equity retention award in the case of fiscal 2022. The columns include the value of the share amounts issued during fiscal 2023 and 2022, even though the final number of shares comprising the 2023 award was not certified until after the fiscal year end and remained subject to increase or decrease as of August 31, 2023. The market value of all restricted stock is based on the closing price of our common stock on the last trading day in the fiscal year. The closing price as reported by the NYSE American on August 31, 2023 was $126.50.\nFor Adam P. Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, stock awards for fiscal 2022 will vest on August 31, 2024. For Adam P. Chase and Jeffery D. Haigh, stock awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025. For Michael J. Bourque, stock awards for fiscal 2023 will vest on August 31, 2025 or, with respect to his equity retention award only, January 31, 2025. These schedules are outlined in the table below (as of August 31, 2023):\nName\nAugust 31, 2024\nJanuary 31, 2025\nAugust 31, 2025\nAdam P. Chase\n3,083\n13,016\nMichael J.

Chase, Michael J. Bourque, and Jeffery D. Haigh, respectively, under our equity incentive program for fiscal 2023 under the financial performance measures applicable to that plan. Because the amounts were determined after August 31, 2023, based on our fiscal year performance, these forfeitures are not reflected in the tables above. See the discussion under Principal Elements of our 2023 Compensation Program-Equity Incentive Plan in our Compensation Discussion and Analysis above.\nOption Exercises and Stock Vested for 2023\nThe following table sets forth information relating to options exercised by each of our named executive officers in the year ended August 31, 2023. The value realized on exercise of options represents the difference between the fair market value of the shares acquired on exercise, as determined by the closing price per share of our common stock on the exercise date, and the exercise price of the stock option. As a result, the value realized on exercise does not make any adjustment for those shares forfeited to us by the option holder to pay the exercise price or the amount of withholding tax due from the option holder upon exercise, pursuant to the exercise provisions of the plan under which the stock options were granted. The following table also sets forth information relating to stock vesting during fiscal 2023, which includes for Adam P. Chase and Jeffery D. Haigh the equity incentive awards granted on September 1, 2020 and Michael J.

The Company has entered severance arrangements with each of its named executive officers. A summary of these arrangements follows:\nFor our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and General Counsel, if (1) the officers employment with the Company is terminated at any time by the Company without cause, or (2) upon the change of control within 24 months (or 12 months for our General Counsel) immediately following a change in control, the officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause or the officer terminates his employment with the Company for good reason, the officer shall be entitled to severance benefits as outlined below.\nFor our Chief Financial Officer, if within 12 months immediately following a change in control, the officers employment is terminated by the Company without cause or the officer terminates his employment with the Company for good reason, the officer shall be entitled to severance benefits as outlined below.\nIn the case of any of the above triggering events, the named executive officer will receive the following benefits:\n\u25cf\nSeverance pay in an amount equal to a multiple (2.0x in the case of Peter R. Chase and Adam P. Chase and 1.0x in the case of Michael J. Bourque and Jeffery D. Haigh) of the greater of the named executives annual salary in effect prior to the change in control or his annual salary in effect immediately prior to termination. For these purposes, the named executive officers salary will include bonuses, calculated by taking the average of the prior two years annual bonuses.\n\u25cf\nContinued participation in benefits in effect for the named executive as of the date of termination, subject to the terms and conditions of the respective plans and applicable law, for a period of one year following the termination date, or two years in the case of Adam P. Chase.\nThe named executive shall be entitled to his salary through the period ending with the date of such termination and any accrued benefits if terminated for cause. In case of death, disability or retirement, the named executive shall be entitled to such benefits as may be provided to him pursuant to the Companys employee benefit plans.\nRestricted Stock and Option Awards. Under the terms of the applicable restricted stock awards, in the event of a termination without cause, unvested restricted stock awards will vest on a prorated basis through the date of termination.\nIn the event of a change in control as defined in the applicable award, unvested shares of restricted stock will automatically vest, and the vesting of outstanding but unvested stock options may be accelerated, at the discretion of the Board of Directors. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed the accelerated vesting of stock options upon the occurrence of a change in control.\nAmounts that would have been owed to our named executive officers upon termination or a change of control assuming a triggering event took place on August 31, 2023, the last day of the Companys most recently completed fiscal year, are presented below.\nAfter\nChange in\nControl\nTermination\nBefore\nwithout\nChange in\nCause or by\nControl\nthe\nTermination\nExecutive\nDisability,\nVoluntary or\nwithout\nfor Good\nDeath or\nChange in\nName\nBenefit\nFor Cause\nCause\nReason\nRetirement\nControl\nPeter R.

The Company will pay outplacement services for a period of up to one year for the Chief Financial Officer if employment with the Company is terminated within 12 months following a change in control by either the Company without cause or by the Chief Financial Officer for good reason. These services are not reflected in the table above, as the amount cannot be determined.\nOther Executive Plans\nNon-Qualified Retirement Savings Plan. The Company maintains a non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan covering selected employees, including the named executive officers. The Supplemental Savings Plan covers those employees of the Company who from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors and who meet other eligibility and salary criteria. For fiscal 2023, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were the only named executive officers who participated in the plan. Participants may elect to defer a portion of their compensation for future payment in accordance with the terms of the plan. The following table gives details relating to our named executive officers participation in this plan.\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation for 2023\nExecutive\nRegistrant\nAggregate Earnings\nContributions in\nContributions in\n(Loss) in\nWithdrawals\nAggregate Balance at\nName\nFiscal Year\nFiscal Year ($)(1)\nFiscal Year ($)(2)\nFiscal Year ($)(3)\nFiscal Year ($)(3)\nFiscal Year End ($)(4)\nAdam P.

In addition to the contribution for fiscal 2023, this column reports the portion of the aggregate balance that was reported as compensation in the Summary Compensation Table in each of the Companys previous proxy statements and includes aggregate earnings on previously contributed amounts (if any).\nAll payments under the Supplemental Savings Plan to participants or their designated beneficiaries will be made in a lump sum. Distribution of these amounts will commence no later than the end of the year in which the participant has separated from service with the Company.\nEffective January 1, 2017 (during fiscal year 2017), Peter R. Chase, Executive Chairman, entered a separation of service letter with the Company, reducing the level of services that he performs as the Executive Chairman to no more than 20% of the average level of services performed in the previous 36 months. In doing so, he qualified for payout of his benefits under the non-qualified Supplemental Savings Plan. Mr. Chases balance in the plan was distributed in full in July 2017 (fiscal 2017). Mr. Chase continues to serve as a director and as the Chairman of the Board of Directors.\nPension Plans. The Company maintains a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (Pension Plan for Employees of Chase Corporation) and a non-qualified excess benefit plan (Supplemental Pension Plan). The qualified pension plan covers substantially all employees of certain businesses of the Company who have attained the age of 21 and have completed three months of service. The Supplemental Pension Plan covers those employees of the Company who from time to time may be designated by the Board of Directors and who meet other eligibility and salary criteria. Currently, the Companys Executive Chairman and the Companys Chief Executive Officer have been designated by the Board of Directors as being covered by the excess benefit plan. Benefits under the qualified pension plan are determined based on final average base earnings (subject to Code-imposed limits on compensation and excluding bonuses, overtime, and other extraordinary amounts) and total years of service with the Company (up to a maximum of 40 years). Benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan are determined based on final average earnings (including base salary and incentive-based bonuses and without regard to Code-imposed limits on compensation) and total years of service with the Company. A participant becomes fully vested in the Supplemental Pension Plan benefits upon completion of five years of service with the Company. Benefits are payable upon the participants separation from service with the Company, including the participants retirement or death. Benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan are paid out on a monthly basis over a period of ten years.\nThe following table shows the actuarial present value of the accumulated benefits for each of the named executive officers at the end of fiscal 2023. The change in this present value between each fiscal year is reflected in the summary compensation table above.\nNumber of\nPresent Value of\nPayments\nYears Credited\nAccumulated\nDuring Last\nName\nPlan Name\nService (#)\nBenefit ($)\nFiscal Year ($)\nPeter R.

Chase, Executive Chairman, entered a separation of service letter with the Company, reducing the level of services that he performs as the Executive Chairman to no more than 20% of the average level of services performed in the previous 36 months. In doing so, he qualified for payout of his benefits under the Supplemental Pension Plan. His first payment occurred in July 2017, six months after entering the separation of services agreement. Payments continued through fiscal 2022 and are anticipated to continue monthly over a period of ten years.\nSee the Notes to financial statements found in Item 8 of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about the Companys pension plans. For participants who were employed prior to May 1, 1995 or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the monthly benefit is equal to the excess of (a) over (b) plus (c), where:\n(a)\nis 1.5% of the participants final average compensation multiplied by credited service up to a maximum of 35 years;\n(b)\nis 0.6% of the participants final average covered compensation multiplied by credited service up to a maximum of 35 years; and\n(c)\nis 0.8% of the participants average monthly compensation multiplied by credited service in excess of 35 years to a maximum of 40 years.\nFor participants who were employed on or after May 1, 1995 and before December 1, 2008, and are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the monthly benefit is equal to the excess of (a) over (b) plus (c), where:\n(a)is 0.75% of the participants final average compensation multiplied by credited service up to a maximum of 35 years;\n(b)is 0.3% of the participants final average covered compensation multiplied by credited service up to a maximum of 35 years; and\n(c)is 0.4% of the participants average monthly compensation multiplied by credited service in excess of 35 years to a maximum of 40 years.\nEffective December 1, 2008, we adopted a soft freeze in the qualified pension plan whereby no new employees hired will be admitted to the plan, except for employees who were members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union whose contract was amended in June 2012 to include a soft freeze with an effective date of July 15, 2012. All participants admitted to the plan prior to December 1, 2008 or July 15, 2012, as applicable will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements.\nChief Executive Officer Pay Ratio\nAs required by Section 953(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, we are providing the following information about the relationship of the total annual compensation of our median compensated employee and the total annual compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase.\nFor fiscal 2023, we identified our median compensated employee as of August 31, 2023, out of our total global employee population of 859 employees at the time, using a Consistently Applied Compensation Measure (CACM) of gross payroll earnings for the year-to-date period ending on such date. Gross payroll earnings consist of all compensation elements appearing in payroll records for each individual, which primarily includes base salary or wages, overtime, bonuses, and other pay components. For purposes of determining the median employee, the pay of those permanent employees that were hired or joined the Company after September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023 was adjusted to reflect the full periods gross payroll earnings. Where applicable, gross payroll earnings were converted to U.S. dollars using the average foreign exchange rates from September 1, 2022 through August 31, 2023.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, we are required to identify our median employee at least once every three years. Due to the acquisition of NuCera Solutions, the Company identified a new median employee for fiscal 2023.\nFor our fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, our median employee identified as described above had total compensation, determined in accordance with applicable SEC rules, of $49,404. As reported in the Summary Compensation Table, the 2023 annual total compensation for our Chief Executive Officer, Adam P. Chase, was $2,444,144 resulting in a pay ratio of 49:1.\nThis pay ratio is a reasonable estimate calculated in a manner consistent with SEC rules. The SEC rules for identifying the median compensated employee and calculating the pay ratio based on that employees annual total compensation allow companies to adopt a variety of methodologies, to apply certain exclusions, and to make reasonable estimates and assumptions that reflect their compensation practices. As such, the pay ratio reported by other companies may not be comparable to the pay ratio reported above, as other companies may have different employment and compensation practices and may utilize different methodologies, exclusions, estimates and assumptions in calculating their own pay ratios.\nCompensation of Directors\nThe following table shows how non-employee Directors of the Company are compensated for service on both the Board of Directors and the Committees of the Board of Directors for both the twelve-month period ending January 31, 2024 (the 2024 Term) and for the twelve-month period ended January 31, 2023 (the 2023 Term).\n2024 Term (1)\n2023 Term (2)\nCash\nStock Awards\nCash\nStock Awards\n($)\n($)\n($)\n($)\nAnnual retainer\n$\n70,000\n$\n95,000\n$\n45,000\n$\n60,000\nCommittee membership (all members):\nAudit\n-\n-\n3,750\n3,750\nCompensation and Management Development\n-\n-\n2,500\n2,500\nNominating and Governance\n-\n-\n1,875\n1,875\nCommittee chairperson (in addition to Committee membership):\nAudit\n19,500\n-\n7,500\n7,500\nCompensation and Management Development\n14,500\n-\n5,000\n5,000\nNominating and Governance\n10,000\n-\n3,750\n3,750\nLead Independent Director\n20,000\n-\n10,000\n10,000\n(1) The 2024 term begins on February 1, 2023 - January 31, 2024.
