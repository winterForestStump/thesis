We implement our software platform for our customers through our professional services organization, which works with OEMs and suppliers to optimize our software for the requirements, configurations and acoustic characteristics of specific vehicle models.\nThe market for automotive cognitive assistance is rapidly expanding. The proliferation of smartphones and smart speakers has encouraged consumers to rely on a growing number of virtual assistants and special-purpose bots for various tasks such as controlling entertainment systems and checking the news. Automobile drivers and passengers increasingly expect hands-free access to virtual assistants as part of the mobility experience, with common use cases in a variety of categories including mobility domains such as navigation, voice-activated texts, and telephone communication, automobile domains, such as automobile user guides, and ignition on-off, and generic domains, such as entertainment. To meet the increasing demand for automotive cognitive assistance and to offer differentiated mobility experiences, OEMs and suppliers are building proprietary virtual assistants into an increasing proportion of their vehicles. We believe that this trend will continue and that consumer appetite for automotive cognitive assistance will grow further as vehicles become more autonomous and drivers pursue new forms of human-vehicle engagement previously not feasible during vehicle operation.\nWe generate revenue primarily by selling software licenses and cloud-connected services. In addition, we generate professional services revenue from our work with OEMs and suppliers during the design, development and deployment phases of the vehicle model lifecycle and through maintenance and enhancement projects. Through our over 20 years in the automotive industry, we have developed longstanding industry relationships and benefit from incumbency. We have existing relationships with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers, and while our customer contracts vary, they generally represent multi-year engagements, giving us visibility into future revenue. We have master agreements or similar commercial arrangements in place with many of our customers, supporting customer retention over the long term.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had five-year remaining performance obligations of $303.5 million, which includes $217.6 million of estimated future revenue related to remaining performance obligations and $85.9 million of contractual commitments which have not yet been invoiced. As of September 30, 2022, we had variable five-year backlog of $0.8 billion, which includes estimated future revenue from variable forecasted royalties related to our embedded and connected businesses. Our estimation of forecasted royalties is based on our royalty rates for embedded and connected technologies from expected car shipments under our existing contracts over the term of the programs. Anticipated shipments are based on historical shipping experience and current customer projections that management believes are reasonable as of the date of this Form 10-K. Both our embedded and connected technologies are priced and sold on a per-vehicle or device basis, where we receive a single fee for either or both the embedded license and the connected service term. However, our five-year backlog may not be indicative of our actual future revenue. The revenue we actually recognize is subject to several factors, including the number and timing of vehicles our customers ship, potential terminations or\nchanges in scope of customer contracts, and currency fluctuations. As of September 30, 2022, we estimate our five-year backlog to be $1.1 billion, including $303.5 million of five-year remaining performance obligations and $0.8 billion of five-year variable backlog. As of September 30, 2021, the estimated five-year backlog was $1.3 billion.\nOur solutions have been installed in more than 450 million automobiles to date, including over 40 million new vehicles in fiscal 2022 alone. Based on royalty reports provided by our customers and third-party reports of total vehicle production worldwide, we estimate that approximately 51% of all cars shipped during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 included Cerence technologies. Cerence hybrid solutions shipped on approximately 8.0 million vehicles during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. In aggregate, over 80 OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers worldwide use our solutions, covering over 70 languages and dialects, including English, German, Spanish, French, Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Hindi.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we generated revenue of $327.9 million, a decrease of 15.3% compared to $387.2 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. We recorded net loss of $310.8 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, a change of 777.2% compared to net income of $45.9 million recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30. 2021.

We deliver automotive cognitive assistance solutions that are conversational and intuitive and that enable OEMs to strengthen the emotional connection with their end users through a distinct, consistent, branded experience. We continue to extend these solutions to two-wheel vehicles and tractors and other transportation means. Our principal offering is our software platform, which our customers use to build virtual assistants that can communicate, find information and take action across an expanding variety of categories, including navigation, control, media, communication, information and tools. Our software, developed in deep partnership with the automotive industry, improves the mobility experience for drivers and passengers all over the world.\nUser engagement with virtual assistants built with our software platform typically begins with a voice request. Upon receiving such an input, our software platform determines what the user has said, infers user intent, and maps the request to the most applicable category and domain. Depending on the applicable domain, our software platform determines whether to respond directly or access an external data source or third-party virtual assistant, in all cases resulting in a response including spoken words or taking action. Depending on the complexity of the request and other factors, engagement may consist of multiple rapid voice interactions with the user and may combine assistance in multiple domains.\nOur software platform offers a hybrid architecture combining edge software components, which are embedded in a vehicles head unit and integrated with onboard systems, with cloud-connected components, which access data and content on external networks and support over-the-air updates. This hybrid architecture enables our software platform to combine the performance, reliability, efficiency, security and tight vehicular integration of embedded software with the flexibility that cloud connectivity provides. Response frameworks can generally be customized such that requests are processed first at the edge, controlling cloud transmission costs, or in parallel at the edge and in the cloud, to achieve higher confidence responses with low latency. Through edge computing capabilities, the platform is able to provide certain features, such as wake up words, while avoiding privacy and latency issues associated with always-listening cloud-connected technologies. Our software platform includes a common programming framework including toolkits and applications for its edge and cloud-connected components, and our customers can choose the software components that are necessary to power the experiences that they want to build and offer.\nCerence Platform Framework - Hybrid Architecture\nWe deliver our software platform through our professional services organization, which works with OEMs and suppliers to tailor it to the desired requirements, configurations and acoustic characteristics of specific vehicle models. For an initial implementation, our professional services engagements typically begin with the porting of our key technologies to the customers specific hardware and software platforms and the development of specific dialogues and grammar libraries. Our professional services teams also work with OEMs on acoustic optimization of a system and application of our audio signal processing technologies. Following an initial implementation, our professional services organization may continue to provide services over the course of a head unit program and vehicle model lifecycle through maintenance and enhancement engagements.\nEdge Software Components\nOur software platforms edge software components are installed on a vehicles head unit and can operate without access to external networks and information. We tailor our edge software components to a customers desired use cases and a vehicle models unique systems, sensors and data interfaces.\nCapabilities of our edge software components include automatic speech recognition, natural language understanding, noise cancellation, driver and passenger voice isolation, voice biometrics, wake-up word and text-to-speech synthesis, as well as certain non-speech technologies such as gaze, gesture and touch input. Our software can support more than 70 languages and dialects. Edge deployment suits these technologies as it provides the following functionality and benefits:\nPerformance. Processing at the edge is often necessary to meet the low latency requirements of natural conversation.\nVehicle Systems Integration. Vehicle applications, sensors, and data interfaces can be integrated deeply with embedded systems.\nAvailability. Edge-located systems are available regardless of cellular coverage and network connectivity.\nReduced cost. Processing at the edge reduces or eliminates cellular data transmission costs.\nPrivacy. Users utterances and system outputs processed at the edge remain onboard and can immediately be purged.\nCertain forms of assistant speech invocation can only be implemented using edge software. The use of wake-up words like Hey BMW and Ni hao Banma require constant listening and signal processing to identify instances when a virtual assistant should activate and respond. The same requirements apply to our JustTalk technology, which constantly listens to spoken conversation, determines speaker intent, and invokes assistance appropriately without requiring a specific invocation phase. The alternative of sending a constant stream of audio from the car interior to the cloud for processing would require enormous amounts of bandwidth and potentially create privacy concerns.\nWe typically sell our edge software components under a traditional per unit perpetual software license model, in which a per unit fee is charged for each software instance installed on an automotive head unit. Our customers generally provide estimates of the\nunits to be shipped for a particular program, and we review third-party market studies and work with our customers to refine and understand these projections. While these projections provide us with some reasonable visibility into future revenue, the number of units to be shipped for a particular program is not committed upfront.\nCloud-Connected Components\nOur software platforms cloud-connected components are comprised of certain speech and natural language understanding related technologies, AI-enabled personalization and context-based response frameworks, and content integration platforms. Our cloud-connected speech-related technologies perform many of the same tasks as our speech-related edge components while offering enhanced functionality through increased computational power and access to external content. Cloud-connected components also support the replication of personalized settings such as voice profiles and preferences across multiple vehicles.\nWe offer cloud-connected components in the form of a connected service to the vehicle end user. Initial subscriptions typically have multi-year terms from the time of a vehicles sale and are paid in advance by the OEM or supplier. Renewal options vary and are managed by our customers on behalf of vehicle end users.\nVirtual Assistant Coexistence\nThe wide variety of use cases encompassed by automotive cognitive assistance, in the context of evolving consumer preferences, necessitates the coexistence of multiple virtual assistants within the in-vehicle environment. For example, many vehicle-related categories such as navigation and control can best be addressed by a tightly integrated, vehicle-model-specific virtual assistant. At the same time, drivers and passengers often prefer to use familiar Internet-based virtual assistants for more general domains such as entertainment.\nTo enable drivers and passengers to extend their digital life from outside the vehicle to inside the vehicle, our software platform can support the integration of third-party virtual assistants, providing a uniform interface for virtual assistant engagement. We have invested in our platform to develop the technology and capabilities necessary to integrate third party virtual assistants with vehicles systems.\nTo make integration as seamless as possible, we have built cognitive arbitration technology that is capable of inferring user intent, determining which within a set of virtual assistants would be best suited to address a request, and sending the request to the selected assistant thus enabling users to extend their digital life into the automobile. Depending on a systems configuration and the virtual assistants to which it is connected, output can be presented back to the user through a vehicle-specific personality or through the virtual assistants own interface. Cognitive arbitration represents an important control point with respect to the mobility experience and an important brand differentiation opportunity for OEMs and suppliers. Like the rest of our software platform, cognitive arbitration is a white label product that can be customized and branded.\nAlong with providing OEMs control over their brand identity, our cognitive arbitration technology is an important element in letting an OEM design the overall driver and passenger experience. This technology allows an OEM to dictate interactions with third-party virtual assistants within the vehicle, strengthening its ability to differentiate and control the overall in-vehicle experience.\nProfessional Services\nWe have a large professional services team that works with our customers in the design, development and deployment phases of a vehicle head unit program and vehicle model lifecycle, as well as in maintenance and enhancement engagements. Our range of capabilities include personalization of grammar and natural language understanding development, localization, language selection and system coverage, navigation speech data generation, system prompt recordings, porting our platforms framework and our ability to deploy cognitive arbitration technologies, and user experience reviews and studies. Our professional services team is globally distributed to serve our customers in their primary design and production jurisdictions. We typically charge manufacturers for our design and consulting work, which are primarily project-based, in line with customary non-recurring engineering industry practices.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nOur key competitive strengths include:\nIndustry-leading speech-related technology. Our research shows that consumers see speech as an increasingly attractive medium for human-vehicle interaction. Nevertheless, they are often frustrated with speech recognition solutions that misunderstand spoken language or require users to speak rigid, pre-defined commands associated with a limited set of functions. Developing conversation-based automotive virtual assistants that users will perceive as natural is challenging as a matter of artificial intelligence technology, acoustic engineering and user interface design. We believe our software platform, as tailored for a specific vehicle model by our professional services organization, represents one of the most technologically advanced and highest-performing human-vehicle speech interaction systems available today. In tests performed by our customers to assess correct recognition of words, sentences, and domains, our solutions have achieved some of the highest marks relative to competitors and our offerings are backed by our portfolio of patents and associated rights.\nHybrid edge-cloud system architecture. Our software platforms hybrid architecture combines the performance, reliability and tight integration that only edge software can provide with the flexibility of cloud connectivity. Cloud-reliant solutions with which our software platform competes cannot match edge softwares low latency, its bandwidth efficiency or its availability in the absence of network connectivity. Moreover, emerging speech invocation paradigms such as wake up words and situationally aware invocation are most effectively implemented using edge technology.\nBespoke vehicle integration and acoustic tuning. Cognitive assistance for categories such as navigation, entertainment and control requires tight integration with onboard vehicle components, which vary widely among vehicle models. Separately, speech interaction systems can be significantly hampered by the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin and must be tuned for particular acoustics and audio system components. To achieve the tight vehicle integration necessary to address these concerns, our professional services team works closely with OEMs and suppliers to customize our offerings for the particular characteristics of specific vehicle models. Our expertise in acoustics enables us to implement systems that can isolate the voices of individual speakers and support simultaneous virtual assistance for speakers in multiple zones, representing a key point of differentiation.\nInteroperability with third-party Internet-based virtual assistants. Virtual assistants from large technology companies have become popular with consumers. We believe that consumers want to extend the use of these assistants while traveling in their vehicles and that a comprehensive automotive cognitive assistance system requires the coexistence of multiple virtual assistants. To accommodate their end user preferences while still providing a unique and brand-specific experience, OEMs seek to offer a common in-vehicle interface with seamless integration across various virtual assistants. To this end, our software platform can support the coexistence of multiple third-party virtual assistants and provide a uniform interface for virtual assistant engagement. Our market-leading position, our focus on the automotive market and the large size of our installed base create incentives for third party virtual assistant providers to work with us and support this integration.\nIndependence from large technology companies and automobile industry players. As vehicles become more autonomous, mobility experiences are being increasingly defined by in-cabin features and alternative forms of human-vehicle engagement. Branded, differentiated automotive cognitive assistance is thus increasingly important to OEMs brand value. As a neutral, independent, white-label software platform vendor, we empower our customers to build branded and differentiated experiences and retain ownership of, or rights to, their system design and data. The virtual assistant coexistence enabled by our cognitive arbitration functionality is designed to allow our customers to provide access to third-party virtual assistants without ceding overall control of the cognitive assistance experience.\nOEM alignment. The design and development of the head unit within the vehicle ecosystem is a complex process requiring tight integration of the software and hardware components used in and with the vehicle. We believe our demonstrated long-standing capabilities in working closely with OEMs, understanding their needs, product roadmaps and global go-to-market strategies enables us to innovate our technologies to meet an OEMs specifications. Furthermore, our working relationships with OEMs uniquely allow us to market and sell our solutions on both a local and global basis in accordance with an OEMs particular requirements.\nBroad language coverage. Our software platform supports over 70 languages and dialects, far more than any of our competitors. As a result of our broad language support, our customers are already delivering cognitive assistance based on our software platform across the Americas, Europe and Asia, including China, the U.S. and all other large automotive markets. Our language support also enables multi-lingual capabilities for domains such as music selection, point-of-interest selection, and cross-border navigation among others, representing a critical feature for markets such as Continental Europe in which automobiles may routinely traverse multiple lingual zones. We believe that our portfolio of languages and multi-lingual capabilities represent an important competitive advantage, as the development of capabilities to support a new language is expensive and time-consuming.\nBroad, global network of deep relationships with OEMs and tier 1 suppliers. We have supplied speech recognition systems to OEMs and suppliers for over 20 years, working closely with our customers through our global professional services organization to design and integrate our solutions into their brands. Today, we work with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide, leveraging the geographic breadth and industry experience of our professional services teams. Our long history in the automotive industry and the global reach and experience of our over 500 professional services employees across 12 countries gives us credibility with OEMs as we seek new business with OEMs, either directly or through their tier 1 suppliers. We believe that OEMs who sell globally will value our experience in servicing and deploying solutions on a global basis. We often have master agreements or similar commercial arrangements with our customers. These master agreements help us retain customer relationships over the long term.\nOur Growth Strategies\nWe believe our growth opportunity has three key facets: continued investment in expanding our core technology, development of new applications that extend our core technology into innovative applications, and expansion of our target market beyond automobiles. Successful execution of these key objectives could lead to the greater penetration of our offerings and key enabling technologies throughout our target markets, resulting in an increase in the revenue we are able to capture per vehicle and expansion of our market share relative to competitors.\nOur primary strategies for pursuing our growth include the following:\nMaintain and extend product leadership. We intend to continue investing in developing our core product functionality and expanding the breadth of categories and domains our software platform is able to address, particularly with a view toward maintaining our market share in edge software components and growing our share in cloud-connected software functionalities. Our existing relationship with, and our proximity in the design process to, OEMs provides us with insight into the needs of the end-users and roadmaps for innovation. For instance, this insight has helped us identify and advance our technologies for autonomous driving systems, which technologies have been incorporated in solutions currently under development. Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in customizing and supporting our solutions for specific individual automobile vehicle models, resulting in tight integration of our solutions. We believe that increasing complexity of our edge software components, including with respect to multi-modal interaction, and growth in our cloud-connected product areas, including the enabling of third-party services, will enable us to increase the revenue per vehicle that we are\nable to generate. Additionally, we believe that these investments will help maintain our position with existing customers through new vehicle models and enable us to grow with the overall market for automotive cognitive assistance.\nContinue to invest in interoperability with third-party virtual assistants. We believe that the growing popularity of third-party virtual assistants is creating increasing demand for access to these assistants as part of the mobility experience. We also believe that complete automotive cognitive assistance requires the coexistence of multiple virtual assistants. We intend to continue to invest to develop our software platforms interoperability with third-party virtual assistants and its cognitive arbitration capabilities to maintain its position as a neutral automotive cognitive assistance platform. We believe a neutral automotive cognitive assistance platform will increasingly be valued by OEMs that prioritize maintaining their unique and branded in-car experience and the ability to control the mobility experience overall.\nDeliver new functionality to existing installed base. Our solutions have been installed in more than 450 million vehicles to date. Our large installed base represents an opportunity to deliver new features and software. Depending on system capabilities, we are able to deliver updated functionality to our users in the form of embedded software upgrades performed by dealers and over-the-air updates delivered from the cloud.\nDevelop products that leverage our expertise in new applications. We have developed new products that leverage our expertise in voice-AI into new applications that will be distinct from our Edge or Cloud-connected product offerings. These new applications are expected to generate revenue using either a subscription or transaction-based model extending the companys market opportunity into new areas. New applications developed include Cerence Tour Guide, Cerence Pay and Car Life. Cerence Tour Guide is an AI-powered application for automotive assistants that brings guided tour content directly into the car via an ecosystem of partners. Cerence Pay offers a secure, contactless payment experience for drivers via voice and facial biometrics. Cerence Car Life is a suite of AI-powered, software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings that provides drivers with up-to-date information about their cars via a companion application, voice output from the automotive assistant, and imagery displayed on the cars infotainment system.\nExpand into adjacent transportation markets. Today, we primarily target the automobile market. However, our products and technology also have application to other modes of transportation. Any types of vehicles that move people are potential applications for our technology. We have integrated our technologies and solutions within the two-wheel vehicle market and have explored opportunities in the cruise line, public transit, fleet, and elevator markets. In total, we believe these adjacent markets represent an important growth opportunity.\nCompetition\nThe automobile cognitive assistance market is competitive. Today, we face two primary sets of competitors:\nLarge technology companies. Many large technology companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent, offer Internet-based virtual assistants. Given the popularity in general of these virtual assistants, we believe that automobile drivers and riders increasingly desire the ability to use them as part of the mobility experience. To meet this demand, some of these companies have invested in technologies, such as Apple CarPlay, to make their virtual assistants more accessible within vehicle cabins.\nWhile these third-party virtual assistants directly compete with some of the functionality we provide as part of our software platform, they also increase the need for our software platform in two ways. First, given the fragmented and competitive nature of the virtual assistant market, it is important for OEMs and suppliers to enable their passengers to utilize a variety of virtual assistants. Our software platforms cognitive arbitration functionality can, dependent on appropriate third-party agreements, enable OEMs and suppliers to provide access to multiple third-party virtual assistants through a consistent, branded interface. Second, the noisy environment of a vehicle cabin presents significant speech processing challenges for smartphone-based third-party virtual assistants that are not designed for a specific vehicle model. Our software platform integrates with third-party virtual assistants and improves their functionality by improving the quality of speech input.\nSmall, focused competitors. We compete for business directly with certain companies focused on voice-based virtual assistance, including SoundHound in the U.S., iFlyTek in China, and other regional and technology-focused competitors. These companies have had some success selling into our customer base. However, we believe that we have multiple meaningful competitive advantages, including our scale, our globally distributed team, our best-in-class portfolio of compatible languages, and our deep experience and focus on the automotive market. We also believe that our technology, particularly our speech signal enhancement and acoustic tuning, is superior based on benchmarking results against our competitors. We believe we will continue to be able to compete successfully against these competitors as we continue to invest in our offerings.\nOur industry has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants. Although we find that OEMs often prefer to maintain relationships with suppliers that have a proven record of performance, they also rigorously reevaluate suppliers on the basis\nof product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management.\nTechnology\nOur software platforms edge and cloud-connected software components are based on a number of proprietary technologies. We customize these technologies for specific vehicle models and continuously update and improve our features and functionality. Our key technologies include but are not limited to the following:\nSpeech Signal Enhancement. A high-quality voice input signal is a precondition to reliable speech recognition and cognitive assistance. However, in a typical vehicle cabin, ambient interior sounds and noise from around the vehicle mix with infotainment system output and conversations between passengers, create a complex soundscape that can obscure virtual assistant requests. Audio signal processing technologies are therefore critical to the cognitive assistance experience. We have been developing and combining highly advanced audio signal enhancement technologies for over 20 years, and we tune our software in relation to the placement of microphones in a vehicle to create defined acoustic zones and support the isolation of individual speakers. Our technologies deliver best-in-class speech recognition results, as evidenced by tests performed by our customers to assess correct recognition of words, sentences, and domains, in which our solutions have achieved some of the highest marks relative to competitors.\nAutomatic Speech Recognition. Our speech recognition technology, built using neural networks and specifically designed for automotive applications, is recognized as the automotive industry leader in automatic speech recognition. We support over 70 languages and dialects, representing the largest language portfolios in the speech industry. Key features of our speech recognition technology include free-form conversational interpretation, as opposed to a rigid system of predefined commands, and barge-in capabilities, enabling users to correct and modify their requests in the middle of stating them.\nNatural Language Understanding. Once speech has been captured and accurately converted into words, natural language understanding technology, or NLU, is necessary to match the request to the appropriate category and domain to interpret the users intent. Our NLU system applies artificial intelligence reasoning, including predefined and learned preferences and real-time contextual information, to deliver informative responses consistent with what a user desires. NLU processing is performed by a hybrid of edge and cloud-connected software components to optimize performance, efficiency, reliability and security.\nVocalizer: Text-to-Speech and Natural Language Generation. In many cases, the most useful result of a spoken query or command is a spoken response back to the user. To enable cognitive assistants to speak, we offer text-to-speech technology in more than 65 languages and dialects and over 145 distinct voices. We also have developed the technology to read text using human-like inflection and emotion, as well as, offer custom voices for customers who wish to differentiate themselves through an exclusive personality representing their brand.\nVoice Biometrics. Our software platform includes biometric functionality which can authenticate and personalize the automotive experience by recognizing users based on their voice and automatically load individual preferences and other automotive settings.\nPush-to-Talk, Wake-Up Words and Just Talk. Through our software platform, we are capable of offering three methods for invoking the virtual assistant, which can be implemented alone or in combination:\nPush-to-Talk functionality, most commonly implemented as a button on the steering wheel or center console.\nWake-Up Word functionality, involving a spoken keyword or phrase, such as Hey BMW.\nJust Talk. Our active listening technology, filters out background noise and irrelevant conversation until it hears a keyword, phrase, or command that it understands as related to an applicable domain and which is intended as a virtual assistant request. False triggers are minimized through sophisticated syntax, cadence and intonation analysis performed in real-time and can be further reduced using automobile sensors such as head or body movement trackers.\nCognitive Arbitration. Our cognitive arbitration technology can route arbitrary requests to the most appropriate virtual assistant or bot, including third-party virtual assistants.\nNon-Speech, Multimodal Input. Our technology seeks to mimic conversational human interaction by incorporating input methods beyond speech. Our multimodal capabilities allow vehicle systems to accept multiple forms of input such as voice, gestures, gaze, predictive text and handwriting.\nMulti-Seat Intelligence. Due to its flexible design, our speech signal enhancement technology can be easily configured for complex multi-zone scenarios with various users and nearly arbitrary microphone configurations. Dedicated processing\nmodes enable efficient and robust multi-user speech recognition in challenging acoustical environments. This allows for passenger interaction in individual zones like sharing music or interacting simultaneously with the car or infotainment systems, where some passengers can enjoy browsing their music by speech, while others can send emails or other work-related activities.\nResearch and Development\nWe maintain technical engineering centers in major regions of the world that help develop our software platform and its underlying components and provide our customers with local engineering capabilities and design development.\nWe employ approximately 900 research and development personnel around the world, including scientists, engineers and technicians. Our total research and development expenses were approximately $107.1 million, $112.1 million and $88.9 million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe believe that continued investment in research and development will be critical for us to continue to deliver market-leading solutions for automotive cognitive assistance. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our product portfolio and allocate capital and resources to our growth opportunities.\nCustomers\nOur customers include all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide. Our automobile manufacturer customers, commonly referred to as OEMs, include BMW, XPeng, FCA Group, Ford, Daimler, Geely, Renault-Nissan, SAIC, Toyota, Volkswagen Group and many others and represented approximately 51% of our sales in fiscal year 2022. Our tier 1 supplier customers, who typically sell automobile components to the OEMs, include Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, DENSO TEN, NIO, Harman and many others and represented approximately 49% of our business in fiscal year 2022.\nOur revenue base is geographically diverse. In fiscal 2022, approximately 31%, 27% and 42% of our revenue came from the Americas, Europe and Asia, respectively.\nSales and Marketing and Professional Services\nWe market our offerings using a high-touch OEM solutions model. We sell directly to our customers, which include OEMs and suppliers and as described above under Customers, and for each of our customers we assign a team comprising sales and marketing as well as professional services personnel. Our customer contracts are bespoke and vary widely, but generally represent multi-year agreements providing visibility into future revenue and helping to support retention of customer relationships over the long term.\nOur sales and marketing team includes approximately 100 employees. This team includes sales representatives, account managers, sales engineers, product managers and marketing experts. As we sell our offerings to all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers today, our sales strategy is primarily focused on leveraging our existing customer relationships. Account managers typically have longstanding relationships with specific customers and are distributed worldwide to provide local customer coverage. We oftentimes utilize customer-specific demo days and proof-of-concepts (POCs) in which we showcase our technology and capabilities to OEMs and tier 1 suppliers on an individual basis. These events help maintain our market presence and awareness of our platforms offerings while also providing opportunities to solicit feedback and input from our customers on our roadmap and future technologies.\nOur professional services organization includes approximately 500 employees. These employees work with our customers in the design phase of the vehicle lifecycle to tailor our platform for specific requirements such as branding and also tune the software for the characteristics of a vehicle model. Our professional services team also provides post-design phase services through maintenance engagements, particular with respect to our cloud-connected solutions. The tight integration of our platform into our customers design process and their vehicles supports our ability to win future business with those customers. Like our sales representatives, our professional services employees often have longstanding relationships with specific customers and are distributed worldwide to provide local customer coverage.\nHuman Capital\nSummary\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,700 full-time employees, including approximately 100 in sales and marketing, approximately 200 in administrative functions, approximately 500 in professional services, and approximately 900 in research and development. Approximately 90% of our employees are based outside of the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union; however many of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils or labor unions. To date, we have experienced no work stoppages and believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.\nCulture and Work Environment\nWere a group of highly motivated collaborators who share a common passion for creating meaningful change in our industry and shaping the future of mobility. We are committed to attracting and retaining the best and brightest talent and building a culture of transparency, trust, and respect.\nWe are proactively nurturing our culture by investing in our people, processes and professional development. We understand our people are critical for our continued success and are focused on helping our employees grow at every stage of their career. We have education opportunities and training and development programs that help to enrich the knowledge and talents across the organization. From wellbeing programs and holiday celebrations to our virtual book club and LBGTQ alliance, were focused on maintaining our connections regardless of our physical locations.\nCompensation, Rewards and Benefits\nIn addition to competitive base salaries, we provide incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics. We also provide compensation in the form of restricted stock unit grants as well as a competitive time-off policy. We offer comprehensive benefit options, including retirement savings plans, medical insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, and an employee stock purchase plan, among others.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe are a global team that seeks to build a diverse and inclusive workplace built upon the different perspectives, beliefs, and backgrounds of our people. We embrace what makes us each unique. Strengthening diversity enables us to bring our collective ideas together to make the best decisions for the global community we serve. We have successfully launched affinity groups for Diversity and Inclusion, Women in Technology, and Working Parents, as well as our Book Club. We celebrated important cultural observances such as Black History Month, Womens History Month, and Pride Month. Its extremely important that every employee feel welcome and valued as we strive to make our company a great place to work.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own approximately 989 patents and patent applications and other intellectual property. Prior to our Spin-Off from Nuance, we entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement, which provides us with certain non-exclusive rights with respect to patents that will continue to be held by Nuance. While no individual patent or group of patents, taken alone, is considered material to our business, in the aggregate, these patents and rights provide meaningful protection for our products, technologies, and technical innovations. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K and each of the risks described below, which we believe are the material risks that we face. Some of the risks relate to our business, others to our intellectual property and technology, and the consequences of the Spin-Off. Some risks relate to the securities markets, our indebtedness and ownership of our securities. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made in this Form 10-K.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe market in which we operate is highly competitive and rapidly changing and we may be unable to compete successfully.\nThere are a number of companies that develop or may develop products that compete in the automotive voice assistance market. The market for our products and services is characterized by intense competition, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging business and distribution models, disruptive software technology developments, short product and service life cycles, price sensitivity on the part of customers, and frequent new product introductions, including alternatives for certain of our products that offer limited functionality at significantly lower costs or free of charge. In addition, some of our competitors have business objectives that may drive them to sell their alternative offerings at a significant discount to our offerings in the automotive voice assistant market. Current and potential competitors have established, or may establish, cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their technologies to address the needs of our prospective customers. Furthermore, existing or prospective customers may decide to develop competing products or have established, or may in the future establish, strategic relationships with our competitors. We also face significant competition with respect to cloud-based solutions in the automotive cognitive assistance market where existing and new competitors may have or have already established significant market share and product offerings.\nThe competition in the automotive cognitive assistance market could adversely affect our operating results by reducing the volume of the products and solutions we license or sell or the prices we can charge. Some of our current or potential competitors are large technology companies that have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do, and others are smaller specialized companies that possess automotive expertise or regional focus and may have greater price flexibility than we do.\nThese competitors may be able to respond more rapidly than we can to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements, or may decide to offer products at low or unsustainable cost to win new business. They may also devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we do, and in certain cases may be able to include or combine their competitive products or technologies with other of their products or technologies in a manner whereby the competitive functionality is available at lower cost or free of charge within the larger offering. To the extent they do so, penetration of our products, and therefore our revenue, may be adversely affected. Our large competitors may also have greater access to data, including customer data, which provides them with a competitive advantage in developing new products and technologies. Our success depends substantially upon our ability to enhance our products and technologies, to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost-effective basis, new products and features that meet changing customer requirements and incorporate technological enhancements, and to maintain our alignment with the OEMs, their technology and market strategies. If we are unable to develop new products and enhance functionalities or technologies to adapt to these changes and maintain our alignment with OEMs, our business will suffer.\nAdverse conditions in the automotive industry or the global economy more generally could have adverse effects on our results of operations.\nOur business depends on, and is directly affected by, the global automobile industry. Automotive production and sales are highly cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors, including consumer spending and preferences, changes in interest rate levels and credit availability, consumer confidence, fuel costs, fuel availability, environmental impact, governmental incentives and regulatory requirements, and political volatility, especially in energy-producing countries and growth markets. Such factors may also negatively impact consumer demand for automobiles that include features such as our products. In addition, automotive production and sales can be affected by our customers ability to continue operating in response to challenging economic conditions, and in response to labor relations issues, regulatory requirements, trade agreements and other factors. The volume of global automotive production has fluctuated, sometimes significantly, from year to year, and such fluctuations give rise to fluctuations in the demand for our products. Moreover, the automotive industry has recently experienced, and may continue to experience, a semiconductor shortage, which has negatively impacted the production of new vehicles. Any significant adverse change in any of these factors, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and the resulting bankruptcy of a customer, the closure of a customer manufacturing facility or the ability of a customer manufacturing facility to obtain supplies to manufacture automobiles and to ship or receive shipments of parts, supplies or finished product, may result in a reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn recent months, we have observed increased economic uncertainty in the United States and abroad. Impacts of such economic weakness include:\nfalling overall demand for goods and services, leading to reduced profitability;\nreduced credit availability;\nhigher borrowing costs;\nreduced liquidity;\nvolatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets; and\nbankruptcies.\nThese developments, along with continued uncertainty about economic stability related to the global outbreak of COVID-19 and more recently the Russian invasion of Ukraine, have resulted in supply chain disruption, inflation, higher interest rates, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and uncertainty about business continuity, which may adversely affect our business and our results of operations. As our customers react to global economic conditions and the potential for a global recession, we may see them reduce spending on our products and take additional precautionary measures to limit or delay expenditures and preserve capital and liquidity. Reductions in spending on our solutions, delays in automobile production or purchasing decisions, lack of renewals or the inability to attract new customers, as well as pressure for extended billing terms or pricing discounts, would limit our ability to grow our business and negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.\nPandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, our business, which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur business depends on, and is directly affected by, the output and sales of the global automotive industry and the use of automobiles by consumers. Pandemics or disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, global automotive industry customer sales and production volumes. Vehicle production initially decreased significantly in China, which was first affected by COVID-19, then Europe and also the United States. Subsequent events resulted in the shutdown of manufacturing operations in China, Europe and the United States, and even though manufacturing operations have resumed, the capacity of such\nglobal manufacturing operations remains uncertain. More recently, we have seen, and anticipate that we will continue to see, supply chain challenges in the automotive industry related to semiconductor devices that are used in automobiles. As a result, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in entering into new contracts with our customers, a decline in revenues resulting from the decrease in the production and sale of automobiles by our customers, the use of automobiles, increased difficulties in collecting payment obligations from our customers and the possibility customers will stall or not continue existing projects. These all may be further exacerbated by the global economic downturn resulting from the pandemic which could further decrease consumer demand for vehicles or result in the financial distress of one or more of our customers.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, given the elevated number of COVID-19 cases throughout the world as a result of the highly transmissible Delta and Omicron variants, our business operations could be further disrupted or delayed. The pandemic has already resulted in, and may continue to result in, work stoppages, slowdowns and delays, travel restrictions, and other factors that cause a decrease in the production and sale of automobiles by our customers. The production of automobiles with our products has been and may continue to be adversely affected with production delays and our ability to provide engineering support and implement design changes for customers may be impacted by restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put in place by businesses and governments.\nThe full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of COVID-19, including variants such as Delta and Omicron, its severity, the effectiveness of actions to treat or contain the virus and its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. The COVID-19 pandemic could also result in additional governmental restrictions and regulations, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market impact resulting from or related to COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, our access to needed capital and liquidity, and the value of our common stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has lessened or subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business and financial performance as a result of its global economic impact.\nOur strategy to increase cloud connected services may adversely affect our near-term revenue growth and results of operations.\nOur leadership position has historically been derived from our products and services based on edge software technology. We have been and are continuing to develop new products and services that incorporate cloud-connected components. The design and development of new cloud-connected components will involve significant expense. Our research and development costs have greatly increased in recent years and, together with certain expenses associated with delivering our connected services, are projected to continue to escalate in the near future. We may encounter difficulties with designing, developing and releasing new cloud-connected components, as well as integrating these components with our existing hybrid technologies. These development issues may further increase costs and may affect our ability to innovate in a manner demanded by the market. As a result, our strategy to incorporate more cloud-connected components may adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations.\nPricing pressures from our customers may adversely affect our business.\nWe may experience pricing pressure from our customers in the future, which could result from the strong purchasing power of major OEMs. As a developer of automotive cognitive assistance components, we may be expected to quote fixed prices or be forced to accept prices with annual price reduction commitments for long-term sales arrangements or discounted reimbursements for our work. We may encounter customers unwilling to accept the terms of our software license or non-recurring engineering agreements. Any price reductions could impact our sales and profit margins. Our future profitability will depend upon, among other things, our ability to continuously reduce the costs for our components and maintain our cost structure. Our profitability is also influenced by our success in designing and marketing technological improvements in automotive cognitive assistance systems. If we are unable to offset any price reductions in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nWe invest effort and money seeking OEMs validation of our technology, and there can be no assurance that we will win or be able to renew service contracts, which could adversely affect our future business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe invest effort and money from the time an OEM or a tier 1 supplier begins designing for an upcoming program to the date on which the customer chooses our technology to be incorporated directly or indirectly into one or more specific vehicle models to be produced by the customer. This selection process is known as a design win. We could expend our resources without success. After a design win, it is typically quite difficult for a product or technology that did not receive the design win to displace the winner until the customer begins a new selection process because it is very unlikely that a customer will change complex technology until a vehicle model is revamped. In addition, the company with the winning design may have an advantage with the customer going forward because of the established relationship between the winning company and such customer, which could make it more difficult for such companys competitors to win the designs for other service contracts. Even if we have an established relationship with a customer, any failure to perform under a service contract or innovate in response to their feedback may neutralize our advantage with that customer.\nIf we fail to win a significant number of customer design competitions in the future or to renew a significant number of existing service contracts, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. Moreover, due to the evolution of our connected offerings and architecture, trending away from providing legacy infotainment and connected services and a change in our professional services pricing strategies, we expect our deferred revenue balances to decrease in the future, including due to a wind-down of a legacy connected service relationship with a major OEM, since the majority of the cash from the contract has been collected. To the extent we are unable to renew existing service contracts, such decrease could intensify. The period of time from winning a contract to implementation is long and we are subject to the risks of cancellation or postponement of the contract or unsuccessful implementation.\nOur products are technologically complex and incorporate many technological innovations. Prospective customers generally must make significant commitments of resources to test and validate our products before including them in any particular vehicle model. The development cycles of our products with new customers are approximately six months to two years after a design win, depending on the customer and the complexity of the product. These development cycles result in us investing our resources prior to realizing any revenues from the customer contracts. Further, we are subject to the risk that a customer cancels or postpones implementation of our technology, as well as the risk that we will not be able to implement our technology successfully. Further, our sales could be less than forecast if the vehicle model is unsuccessful, including reasons unrelated to our technology. Long development cycles and product cancellations or postponements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we lost any of our largest customers.\nThe loss of business from any of our major customers, whether by lower overall demand for vehicles, cancellation of existing contracts or the failure to award us new business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Alternatively, there is a risk that one or more of our major customers could be unable to pay our invoices as they become due or that a customer will simply refuse to make such payments given its financial difficulties. If a major customer becomes subject to bankruptcy or similar proceedings whereby contractual commitments are subject to stay of execution and the possibility of legal or other modification, or if a major customer otherwise successfully procures protection against us legally enforcing its obligations, it is likely that we will be forced to record a substantial loss. In addition, certain of our customers that are tier 1 suppliers exclusively sell to certain OEMs, including some of our other customers. A bankruptcy of, or other significant disruption to, any of these OEMs could intensify any adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period, and this may cause our stock price to decline.\nOur revenue and operating results may fluctuate materially in the future. These fluctuations may cause our results of operations to not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors which would likely cause the price of our stock to decline. Factors that may contribute to fluctuations in operating results include:\ngiven our limited customer base, the volume, timing and fulfillment of large customer contracts;\nrenewals of existing customer contracts and wins of new customer programs;\nour mix of variable, fixed prepaid or fixed minimum purchase commitment license contracts;\nincreased expenditures incurred pursuing new product or market opportunities;\nthe timing of the receipt of royalty reports;\nfluctuating sales by our customers to their end-users;\ncontractual counterparties failing to meet their contractual commitments to us;\nintroduction of new products by us or our competitors;\ncybersecurity or data breaches;\nreduction in the prices of our products in response to competition, market conditions or contractual obligations;\nimpairment of goodwill or intangible assets;\naccounts receivable that are not collectible;\nhigher than anticipated costs related to fixed-price contracts with our customers;\nchange in costs due to regulatory or trade restrictions;\nexpenses incurred in litigation matters, whether initiated by us or brought by third-parties against us, and settlements or judgments we are required to pay in connection with disputes;\nchanges in our stock compensation practices, as relates to employee short-term incentive payments; and\ngeneral economic trends as they affect the customer bases into which we sell.\nDue to the foregoing factors, among others, our financial and operating results may fluctuate significantly from period to period. Our expense levels are based in significant part on our expectations of future revenue, and we may not be able to reduce our expenses quickly to respond to near-term shortfalls in projected revenue. Therefore, our failure to meet revenue expectations would seriously harm our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe may not be successful with the adoption of new products.\nPart of our growth strategy includes the successful introduction of new products that will rely on subscription or transactional-based revenue generation. These represent new applications and we cannot assure the introduction of these new products, the level of adoption of these new products, or how quickly they can ramp to generate meaningful revenue. The development and launch of new products will require maintaining adequate resources, such as the appropriate personnel and technology to develop such products. We may experience delays between the time we incur expenses associated with the development and launch of new products and the revenue generated from the products. In addition, anticipated demand for the new products could decrease after we have spent time and resources on the development of the new product, or our efforts may not lead to the successful introduction of new products that are competitive, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain management and other key personnel, our business could be harmed.\nIf any of our management or other key employees were to leave, we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors and could experience a loss in productivity while any successor obtains the necessary training and experience. Although we have arrangements with some of our executive officers designed to promote retention, our employment relationships are generally at-will and we have had management and other key employees leave in the past. We cannot assure you that one or more management or other key employees will not leave in the future. The departure of key leadership personnel, in particular, can take significant knowledge and experience from the Company. While this loss of knowledge and experience can be mitigated through a successful transition, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such efforts. If we do not successfully manage the transition of management positions, it could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees or investors and could have an adverse impact on our business and strategic direction. A change in senior management, such as we experienced over the past year, also could result in our future strategy and plans differing from those of the past. Further, we intend to continue to hire additional highly qualified personnel, including research and development and operational personnel, but may not be able to attract, assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future. Any failure to attract, integrate, motivate and retain these employees could harm our business.\nWe depend on skilled employees and could be impacted by a shortage of critical skills.\nMuch of our future success depends on the continued service and availability of skilled employees, particularly with respect to technical areas. Skilled and experienced personnel in the areas where we compete are in high demand, and competition for their talents is intense. We expect that many of our key employees will receive a total compensation package that includes equity awards. New regulations or volatility in the stock market could diminish our use, and the value, of our equity awards. This would place us at a competitive disadvantage in attracting qualified personnel or force us to offer more cash compensation.\nSome of our employees are represented by workers councils or unions or are subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the U.S.\nMost of our employees in Europe are represented by workers councils or unions. Although we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and their legal representatives, they must approve any changes in terms which may impede efforts to restructure our workforce.\nCybersecurity and data privacy incidents or breaches may damage client relations and inhibit our growth.\nThe confidentiality and security of our information, and that of third parties, is critical to our business. In particular, our services involve the transmission, use, and storage of customers and their customers information, which may be confidential or contain personally identifiable information. Our internal computer systems and those of our current or future service providers, contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Attacks on information technology systems are increasing in their frequency, levels of\npersistence, sophistication and intensity, and they are being conducted by increasingly sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. The prevalent use of mobile devices also increases the risk of data security incidents.\nWhile we maintain a broad array of information security and privacy measures, policies and practices, our networks may be breached through a variety of means, resulting in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our information, to information of our customers or their customers, or to our intellectual property; disabling or degrading service; or sabotaging systems or information. In addition, hardware, software, systems, or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. Unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud or other forms of deceiving our employees, contractors, and vendors. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, or to sabotage systems, change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nWhile we have not experienced any material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations or the operations of third-party service providers, contractors and consultants, it could result in significant reputational, financial, legal, regulatory, business or operational harm. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incident or breach may result in:\nloss of revenue resulting from the operational disruption;\nloss of revenue or increased bad debt expense due to the inability to invoice properly or to customer dissatisfaction resulting in collection issues;\nloss of revenue due to loss of customers;\nmaterial remediation costs to recreate or restore systems;\nmaterial investments in new or enhanced systems in order to enhance our information security posture;\ncost of incentives offered to customers to restore confidence and maintain business relationships;\nreputational damage resulting in the failure to retain or attract customers;\ncosts associated with potential litigation or governmental investigations, enforcement actions or regulatory fines;\nclaims by third parties asserting that we have breached our privacy, confidentiality, data security or similar obligations;\ncosts associated with any required notices of a data breach;\ncosts associated with the potential loss of critical business data;\ndifficulties enhancing or creating new products due to loss of data or data integrity issues; and\nother consequences of which we are not currently aware of but will discover through the remediation process.\nIn addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related breaches. While we expect to continue to incur significant costs to continuously enhance our information security measures to defend against the threat of cybercrime, there can be no assurance that such measures will successfully prevent service interruptions, data security incidents and other security breaches. Any cybersecurity or data privacy incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCompliance with global privacy and data security requirements could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit our ability to collect and process data globally, and the failure to comply with such requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrivacy and data security have become significant issues in the U.S., Europe and in many other jurisdictions where we conduct or may in the future conduct our operations. The regulatory framework for the collection, use, safeguarding, sharing and transfer of information worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Globally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy frameworks with which we must comply.\nNotably, for example, on May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, which is commonly referred to as GDPR, took effect. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA as well as any company outside the EEA that collects or otherwise processes personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EEA or the monitoring of their behavior. The GDPR enhances data protection obligations for processors and controllers of personal data, including, for example, expanded disclosures about how personal information is to be used, limitations on retention of information,\nmandatory data breach notification requirements and onerous obligations on services providers. The GDPR imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and substantially increases the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance.\nFurther, European data protection laws also prohibit the transfer of personal data from the EEA and Switzerland to third countries that are not considered to provide adequate protections for personal data, including the U.S. With regard to transfers of personal data from the EEA, transfers to third countries that have not been approved as adequate are prohibited unless an appropriate safeguard specified by the GDPR is implemented, such as the Standard Contractual Clauses, or SCCs, approved by the European Commission or binding corporate rules, or a derogation applies. European regulators have issued recent guidance that imposes significant new diligence requirements on transferring data outside the European Union, including under an approved transfer mechanism. While we have taken steps to mitigate the impact on us with respect to transfers of data,\nIn addition, we are subject to Swiss data protection laws, including the Federal Act on Data Protection, or the FADP. While the FADP provides broad protections to personal data, on September 25, 2020, the Swiss federal Parliament enacted a revised version of the FADP, which is anticipated to become effective in 2022 or the beginning of 2023. The new version of the FADP aligns Swiss data protection law with the GDPR.\nFurther, in addition to existing European data protection law, the European Union also is considering another draft data protection regulation. The proposed regulation, known as the Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications, or ePrivacy Regulation, would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. New rules related to the ePrivacy Regulation are likely to include enhanced consent requirements in order to use communications content and communications metadata, as well as obligations and restrictions on the processing of data from an end-users terminal equipment, which may negatively impact our product offerings and our relationships with our customers.\nAs another prominent example, we are also subject to data protection regulation in the UK. Following the UKs withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 and the end of the transitional arrangements agreed between the UK and EU as of January 1, 2021, the GDPR has been incorporated into UK domestic law. United Kingdom-based organizations doing business in the European Union will need to continue to comply with the GDPR. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EUs GDPR, the European Commission recognizes the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. The Information Commissioners Office, or ICO, has recently introduced new mechanisms for international transfers of personal data originating from the U.K. (an International Data Transfer Agreement, or IDTA, along with a separate addendum to the EU SCCs). We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted cross-border data transfers and doing so will require significant effort and cost.\nIn addition to European data protection requirements, the United States Federal Trade Commission and many state attorney generals are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws as imposing standards for the online collection, use, dissemination, and security of data. For example, in June 2018, California enacted the CCPA, which became operative on January 1, 2020 and broadly defines personal information, gives California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, and provides for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. Additionally, a new privacy law, the CPRA, recently was approved by California voters in the November 2020 election. The CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, and goes into effect and fully supersedes CCPA on January 1, 2023. The CPRA will significantly modify the CCPA, including by expanding consumers rights and establishing a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CPRA. For example, the CPRA and the CCPA may lead other states to pass comparable legislation, with potentially greater penalties, and more rigorous compliance requirements relevant to our business. Virginia enacted the VCDA and Colorado enacted the CDA, respectively, which have similar requirements and obligations to the CCPA.\nThe regulatory framework governing the collection, processing, storage, use and sharing of certain information, particularly financial and other personal data, is rapidly evolving and is likely to continue to be subject to uncertainty and varying interpretations. In addition to new and strengthened laws and regulations in the U.S., European Union, and United Kingdom, many foreign jurisdictions have passed new laws, strengthened existing laws, or are contemplating new laws regulating personal data. For example, we are subject to stringent privacy and data protection requirements in many countries including Singapore and Japan. Additional jurisdictions with stringent data protection laws include Brazil and China. We also continue to see jurisdictions, such as Russia, imposing data localization laws, which under Russian laws require personal information of Russian citizens to be, among other data processing operations, initially collected, stored, and modified in Russia.\nPreparing for and complying with the evolving application of these laws has required and will continue to require us to incur substantial operational costs and may interfere with our intended business activities, inhibit our ability to expand into certain markets or prohibit us from continuing to offer services in those markets without significant additional costs. It is possible that these laws may impose, or may be interpreted and applied to impose, requirements that are inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our services and platform capabilities. Any failure or perceived failure by us, or any third parties with which we do business, to comply with our posted privacy policies, changing consumer expectations, evolving laws, rules and regulations, industry standards, or contractual obligations to which we or such third parties are or may become subject, may result in actions or other claims against us by governmental entities or private actors, the expenditure of substantial costs, time and other resources, , may cause our customers to lose confidence in our solutions, harm our reputation, expose us to litigation, regulatory investigations and resulting liabilities including reimbursement of customer costs, damages, penalties or fines imposed by regulatory agencies; and require us to incur significant expenses for remediation.\nA significant portion of our revenues are derived, and a significant portion of our research and development activities are based, outside the United States. Our results could be harmed by economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with these international regions and foreign currency fluctuations.\nBecause we operate worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. We generate most of our international revenue in Europe and Asia, and we anticipate that revenue from international operations will increase in the future. In addition, some of our products are developed outside the United States. We conduct a significant portion of the development of our voice recognition and natural language understanding solutions in Canada and Germany. We also have significant research and development resources in Belgium, China, India, Italy, and the United Kingdom. We are exposed to fluctuating exchange rates of foreign currencies, including the euro, British pound, Canadian dollar, Chinese RMB, Japanese yen, Indian rupee and South Korean won. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors associated with international sales and operations, including:\nadverse political and economic conditions, or changes to such conditions, in a specific region or country;\ntrade protection measures, including tariffs and import/export controls, imposed by the United States and/or by other countries or regional authorities such as China, Canada or the European Union;\nthe impact on local and global economies of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union;\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates or the lack of ability to hedge certain foreign currencies;\ncompliance with laws and regulations in many countries, including with respect to data protection, anticorruption, labor relations, tax, foreign currency, anti-competition, import, export and trade regulations, and any subsequent changes in such laws and regulations;\ngeopolitical turmoil, including terrorism and war, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\nchanging data privacy regulations and customer requirements to locate data centers in certain jurisdictions;\nevolving restrictions on cross-border investment, including recent enhancements to the oversight by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States pursuant to the Foreign Investment Risk Preview Modernization Act and substantial restrictions on investment from China;\nchanges in applicable tax laws;\ndifficulties in staffing and managing operations in multiple locations in many countries;\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions; and\nless effective protection of intellectual property than in the United States.\nOur business in China is subject to aggressive competition and is sensitive to economic, market and political conditions.\nWe operate in the highly competitive automotive cognitive assistance market in China and face competition from both international and smaller domestic manufacturers. We anticipate that additional competitors, both domestic and international, may seek to enter the Chinese market resulting in increased competition. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and our inability to gain or hold market share. There have been periods of increased market volatility and moderation in the levels of economic growth in China, which resulted in periods of lower automotive production growth rates in China than those previously experienced. In addition, political tensions between China and the United States may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in China. If we are unable to grow or maintain our position in the Chinese market, the pace of growth slows or vehicle sales in China decrease, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nGovernment regulations and business considerations may also require us to conduct business in China through joint ventures with Chinese companies. Our participation in joint ventures would limit our control over Chinese operations and may expose our proprietary technologies to misappropriation by joint venture partners. The above risks, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nInterruptions or delays in our services or services from data center hosting facilities or public clouds could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business.\nBecause our services are complex and incorporate a variety of third-party hardware and software, our services may have errors or defects that could result in unanticipated downtime for our customers and harm to our reputation and our business. We have from time to time, found defects in our services, and new errors in our services may be detected in the future. In addition, we currently serve our customers from data center hosting facilities or third-party public clouds we directly manage. Any damage to, or failure of, the systems and facilities that serve our customers in whole or in part could result in interruptions in our service. Interruptions in our service may reduce our revenue, cause us to issue credits or pay service level agreement penalties, cause customers to terminate their on-demand services, and adversely affect our renewal rates and our ability to attract new customers.\nIf our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nWe have significant intangible assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. The most significant intangible assets are goodwill, customer relationships and patents and core technologies. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Technologies and patents are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill on an annual basis. Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, we will be required to assess the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Factors that could trigger an impairment of such assets include the following:\nchanges in our organization or management reporting structure that could result in additional reporting units, which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit;\nsignificant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\nsignificant changes in the strategy for our overall business;\nsignificant negative industry or economic trends;\nsignificant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and\nour market capitalization declining to below net book value.\nAt September 30, 2022, we concluded indicators of impairment were present due to the current macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in our stock price. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nFuture adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in additional impairment charges that would impact our results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified.\nRisks Relating to our Intellectual Property and Technology\nThird parties have claimed and may claim in the future that we are infringing their intellectual property, and we could be exposed to significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products if such claims are successful.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to claims and legal actions alleging that we or our customers may be infringing or contributing to the infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. We may be unaware of intellectual property rights of others that may cover some of our technologies and products. If it appears necessary or desirable, we may seek licenses for these intellectual property rights. However, we may not be able to obtain licenses from some or all claimants, the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us, and we may not be able to resolve disputes without litigation. Any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. Intellectual property disputes could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to enter into royalty and licensing arrangements on unfavorable terms, prevent us from licensing certain of our products, cause severe disruptions to our operations or the markets in which we compete, or require us to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers including contractual provisions under various arrangements. Any of these could seriously harm our business, financial condition or operations.\nUnauthorized use of our proprietary technology and intellectual property could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur success and competitive position depend in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property rights protecting our products and services. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or discover aspects of our products or to obtain, license, sell or otherwise use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use. Additionally, our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially the same or superior to our technologies and that do not infringe our rights. In these cases, we would be unable to prevent our competitors from selling or licensing these similar or superior technologies. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Although the source code for our proprietary software is protected both as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work, litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Litigation, regardless of the outcome, can be very expensive and can divert managements efforts.\nOur software products may have bugs, which could result in delayed or lost revenue, expensive correction, liability to our customers and claims against us.\nComplex software products such as ours may contain errors, defects or bugs. Defects in the solutions or products that we develop and sell to our customers could require expensive corrections and result in delayed or lost revenue, adverse customer reaction and negative publicity about us or our products and services. Customers who are not satisfied with any of our products may also bring claims against us for damages, which, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming to defend, and could result in costly litigation and payment of damages. Such claims could harm our reputation, financial results and competitive position.\nWe may be unable to respond quickly enough to changes in technology and technological risks and to develop our intellectual property into commercially viable products.\nChanges in legislative, regulatory or industry requirements or in competitive technologies may render certain of our products obsolete or less attractive to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to be competitive. There is a risk that we will not be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to be competitive or that certain of our products will become obsolete. Moreover, restrictions on the use of our technology over the next two years under the Intellectual Property Agreement which we entered into with Nuance in connection with the Spin-Off may limit our ability to adapt to technology and regulatory developments and thereby compete effectively in the market. We are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications, including lack of market acceptance, delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe utilize certain key technologies, content and services from, and integrate certain of our solutions with, third parties and may be unable to replace those technologies, content and services if they become obsolete, unavailable or incompatible with our solutions.\nWe utilize certain key technologies and content from, and/or integrate certain of our solutions with, hardware, software, services and content of third parties. Some of these vendors are also our competitors in various respects. These third-party vendors could, in the future, seek to charge us cost prohibitive fees for such use or integration or may design or utilize their solutions in a manner that makes it more difficult for us to continue to utilize their solutions, or integrate their technologies with our solutions, in the same manner or at all. Any significant interruption in the supply or maintenance of such third-party hardware, software, services or content could negatively impact our ability to offer our solutions unless and until we replace the functionality provided by this third-party hardware, software and/or content. In addition, we are dependent upon these third parties ability to enhance their current products, develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the functionality or content provided by third-party vendors in the event that such technologies become obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our solutions or are otherwise not adequately maintained or updated. Any delay in or inability to replace any such functionality could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, delays in the release of new and upgraded versions of third-party software applications could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Relating to the Spin-Off\nIf the Spin-Off were determined not to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could have an indemnification obligation to Nuance, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOn October 1, 2019, we were spun off from Nuance. Completion of the Spin-Off was conditioned on Nuances receipt of a written opinion from its tax counsel to the effect that the Distribution will qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.\nThe opinion of counsel does not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the Spin-Off. The opinion assumed that the Spin-Off was completed according to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement and relied on the facts as stated in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Tax Matters Agreement, the other ancillary agreements, Information Statement included as part of our registration statement on Form 10 and a number of other documents related to the Spin-Off. In addition, the opinion was based on certain assumptions as well as certain representations as to factual matters from, and certain covenants by, Nuance and us. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations or covenants are incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate or are violated in any material respect.\nIf, as a result of any of our representations being untrue or our covenants being breached, the Spin-Off, and certain related transactions or certain transactions, were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain or loss under Section 355 and related provisions of the Code, we could be required to indemnify Nuance for the resulting taxes and related expenses. Those amounts could be material. Any such indemnification obligation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have agreed to numerous restrictions to preserve the non-recognition treatment of the Spin-Off, which may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe have agreed in the Tax Matters Agreement to covenants and indemnification obligations that address compliance with Section 355 and related provisions of the Code and are intended to preserve the tax-free nature of the Spin-Off. These covenants and indemnification obligations may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions that may maximize the value of our business and, under certain circumstances, might discourage or delay a strategic transaction that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Spin-Off.\nWe believe that, as an independent, publicly traded company, we will be able to, among other things, design and implement corporate strategies and policies and develop partnerships that are better targeted to our businesss areas of strength and differentiation, better focus our financial and operational resources on those specific strategies, create effective incentives for our management and employees that are more closely tied to our business performance, provide investors more flexibility and enable us to achieve alignment with a more natural stockholder base and implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs. We may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company in the time we expect, if at all, for a variety of reasons, including:\nas an independent, publicly traded company, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if it were still a part of Nuance; and\nas an independent, publicly traded company, our businesses are less diversified than Nuances businesses prior to the separation.\nIf we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent company, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may have potential business conflicts of interest with Nuance with respect to our past and ongoing relationships.\nConflicts of interest may arise between Nuance and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships, including:\nlabor, tax, employee benefit, indemnification and other matters arising from our separation from Nuance;\nintellectual property matters;\nemployee recruiting and retention; and\nbusiness combinations involving our company.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and, even if we do so, the resolution may be less favorable to us than if we were dealing with an unaffiliated party.\nThe allocation of intellectual property rights and data between Nuance and Cerence as part of the Spin-Off, the shared use of certain intellectual property rights and data following the Spin-Off and restrictions on the use of intellectual property rights, could adversely impact our reputation, our ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into agreements with Nuance governing the allocation of intellectual property rights and data related to our business. These agreements include restrictions on our use of Nuances intellectual property rights and data licensed to us, including limitations on the field of use in which we can exercise our license rights. As a result, we may not be able to pursue opportunities that require use of these license rights in industries other than the automotive industry and certain ancillary fields. Moreover, the licenses granted to us under Nuances intellectual property rights and data are non-exclusive, so Nuance may be able to license the rights and data to third parties that may compete with us. These agreements could adversely affect our position and options relating to intellectual property enforcement, licensing negotiations and monetization and access to data used in our business. We also may not have sufficient rights to grant sublicenses of intellectual property or data used in our business, and we may be subject to third party rights pertaining to the underlying intellectual property or data. These circumstances could adversely affect our ability to protect our competitive position in the industry and otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities and Indebtedness\nThe terms of the Senior Credit Facilities restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to incur debt that we may need to fund initiatives in response to changes in our business, the industry in which we operate, the economy and governmental regulations.\nThe terms of the Senior Credit Facilities include a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in actions that may be in our long-term best interests. These restrict our ability to take some or all of the following actions:\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness or sell disqualified or preferred stock;\npay dividends on, make distributions in respect of, repurchase or redeem capital stock;\nmake investments or acquisitions;\ncreate liens;\nenter into sale/leaseback transactions;\nenter into agreements restricting the ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany transfers;\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\nprepay, repurchase or redeem certain kinds of indebtedness;\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of assets or sell stock of our subsidiaries; and/or\nsignificantly change the nature of our business.\nFurthermore, the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities have required that we pledge our assets as collateral as security for our repayment obligations and that we abide by certain financial or operational covenants. Our ability to comply with such covenants and restrictions may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A breach of any of these covenants, if applicable, could result in an event of default under the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities. If an event of default occurred, the lenders would have the right to accelerate the repayment of such debt, and the event of default or acceleration could result in the acceleration of the repayment of any other debt to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments, and lenders could then proceed against any collateral. Any subsequent replacement of the agreements governing the Senior Credit Facilities or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions. The occurrence and ramifications of an event of default could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, as a result of all of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct our business and pursue our strategy, unable to raise additional debt financing to operate during general economic or business downturns or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.\nWe may evaluate whether to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the future, and the terms of our Senior Credit Facilities limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock.\nOur Board of Directors, or our Board, decisions regarding the payment of dividends depends on consideration of many factors, such as our financial condition, earnings, sufficiency of distributable reserves, opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors that our Board deems relevant. Additionally, the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities limit our ability to pay cash dividends. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence paying dividends.\nServicing our debt may require a significant amount of cash. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our indebtedness, and we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle for cash conversions of the Notes or to repurchase the Notes for cash upon a fundamental change, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIn June 2020, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $175 million 3.00% convertible senior notes due 2025, or the Notes. The interest rate is fixed at 3.00% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant negative consequences for our stockholders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by, among other things: (a) increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions; (b) limiting our ability to obtain additional financing; (c) requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes; (d) limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business; (e) diluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing our common stock upon conversion of the Notes; and (f) placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future that are sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional debt financing or equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance any future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, any of our future debt agreements may contain restrictive covenants that may prohibit us from adopting any of these alternatives.\nHolders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. Upon conversion, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases in connection with such conversion and our ability to pay may additionally be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture governing the Notes or to pay any cash payable on future conversions as required by such indenture would constitute a default under such indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing and future indebtedness. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nIn addition, our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could:\nmake us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry, and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulations;\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;\nplace us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt;\nlimit our ability to borrow additional amounts for funding acquisitions, for working capital, and for other general corporate purposes; and\nmake an acquisition of our company less attractive or more difficult.\nAny of these factors could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, if we incur additional indebtedness, the risks related to our business and our ability to service or repay our indebtedness would increase.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and the value of our common stock.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes would dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our common stock upon any conversion of such Notes. Our Notes may become in the future convertible at the option of their holders under certain circumstances. If holders of our Notes elect to convert their Notes, we may settle our conversion obligation by delivering to them a significant number of shares of our common stock, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder FASB ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuers economic interest cost. ASC 470-20 requires the value of the conversion options of the Notes, representing the equity component, to be recorded as additional paid-in capital within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet and as a discount to the Notes, which reduces their initial carrying value. The carrying value of the Notes, net of the applicable discount recorded, will be accreted up to the principal amount of the Notes, as the case may be, from the issuance date until maturity, which will result in non-cash charges to interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Accordingly, we will report lower net income or higher net loss in our financial results because ASC 470-20 requires interest to include both the current periods accretion of the debt discount and the instruments coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock, and the respective trading price of the Notes.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, or ASU 2020-06, with the intent to simplify ASC 470-20 and ASC subtopic 815-40, Contracts in Entitys Own Equity, or ASC 815-40. Among the changes, ASU 2020-06 removed the requirement to bifurcate the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. The removal of the bifurcation of liability and equity components would eliminate non-cash interest expense corresponding to the amounts recorded within equity. In addition, ASU 2020-06 precludes the use of the treasury stock method, when calculating diluted earnings per share, for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion. The FASB has specified that public companies should adopt ASU 2020-06 as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, our fiscal year 2023.\nWe currently apply the if-converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion options embedded in the Notes on diluted net income per share, which assumes that all of the Notes were converted solely into shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, unless the result would be anti-dilutive. The application of the if-converted method may reduce our reported diluted net income per share to the extent we are profitable, and accounting standards may change in the future in a manner that may otherwise adversely affect our diluted net income per share.\nCertain provisions in our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage takeovers.\nSeveral provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition. These include, among others, provisions that:\ndo not permit our stockholders to act by written consent and require that stockholder action must take place at an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, in each case except as such rights may otherwise be provided to holders of preferred stock;\nestablish advance notice requirements for stockholder nominations and proposals;\nprovide that a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by our Board, the Chairman of our Board or our Chief Executive Officer, or at the request of holders of not less than 20% of the outstanding shares of our common stock; and\nlimit our ability to enter into certain business combination transactions.\nThese and other provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, Amended and Restated By-Laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or a threatened acquisition or change in control of Cerence, including unsolicited takeover attempts, even though the transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock at a price above the prevailing market price.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation designates the courts of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees.\nOur Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, in all cases to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery located within the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of Cerence, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee or stockholder of Cerence to Cerence or Cerences stockholders, any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, or as to which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery located in the State of Delaware or any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or any other action asserting an internal corporate claim as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL. However, if the Court of Chancery within the State of Delaware does not have jurisdiction, the action may be brought in any other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware. Further, this exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, except that it may apply to such suits if brought derivatively on behalf of Cerence. There is, however, uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provision in connection with suits to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act if brought derivatively on behalf of Cerence, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to these provisions. This provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nTax matters may cause significant variability in our financial results and may impact our overall financial condition.\nOur businesses are subject to income taxation in the United States, as well as in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. Tax rates in these jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. If our effective tax rate increases, our operating results and cash flow could be adversely affected. Our effective income tax rate can vary significantly between periods due to a number of complex factors including:\nprojected levels of taxable income;\npre-tax income being lower than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates or higher than anticipated in countries with higher statutory rates;\nincreases or decreases to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets;\ntax audits conducted and settled by various tax authorities;\nadjustments to income taxes upon finalization of income tax returns;\nthe ability to claim foreign tax credits;\nthe repatriation of non-U.S. earnings for which we have not previously provided for income taxes;\nchanges in tax laws and their interpretations in countries in which we are subject to taxation; and\nchanges to assessments of uncertain tax positions.\nWe regularly evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. This analysis is heavily dependent upon our current and projected operating results. A decline in future operating results could provide substantial evidence that a full or partial valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe commercial and credit environment, may adversely affect our access to capital.\nOur ability to issue debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or in the solvency of our customers or suppliers or if there are other significantly unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Volatility in the world financial markets, including the recent increases in interest and inflation rates, could increase borrowing costs or affect our ability to access the capital markets. These conditions may adversely affect our ability to obtain targeted credit ratings.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations due to factors related to our business;\nsuccess or failure of our business strategies;\ncompetition and industry capacity;\nchanges in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flow;\nour level of indebtedness, our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our ability to obtain financing as needed;\nour ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover, or positively cover, our common stock;\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\ninvestor perception of our company and our industry;\noverall market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance;\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\nchanges in laws and regulations (including tax laws and regulations) affecting our business;\nchanges in capital gains taxes and taxes on dividends affecting stockholders; and\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nLow trading volume for our stock would amplify the effect of the above factors on our stock price volatility.\nShould the market price of our shares drop significantly, stockholders may institute securities class action lawsuits against us. A lawsuit against us, such as the currently pending actions described in Part I - Item 3, Legal Proceedings, could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nYour percentage ownership in Cerence may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in Cerence may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we grant to our directors, officers, employees and other service providers. In addition, our Board has adopted the Cerence 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Equity Plan, for the benefit of certain of our current and future employees, service providers and non-employee directors. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designation, powers, preferences and relative, participating, optional and other special rights, including preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and distributions, as our Board may generally determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could dilute the voting power or reduce the value of our common stock. For example, we could grant the holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of the members of our Board in all events or upon the happening of specified events, or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences that we could assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of our common stock.\nFrom time-to-time, we may opportunistically evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities, including acquisitions for which the consideration thereof may consist partially or entirely of newly-issued shares of our common stock and, therefore, such transactions, if consummated, would dilute the voting power and/or reduce the value of our common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired and investors views of us could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent registered public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with auditor attestation of the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources.\nOur ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to be able to prepare timely and accurate financial statements. Any delay in the implementation of, or disruption in the transition to, new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls may cause our operations to suffer, and we may be unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective and to obtain an unqualified report on internal controls from our auditors as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, we cannot be certain that these measures would ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Even if we were to conclude, and our auditors were to concur, that our internal control over financial reporting provided reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect fraud or misstatements. This, in turn, could have an adverse impact on trading prices for shares of our common stock, and could adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Burlington, Massachusetts, and our international headquarters is located in Heerlen, Netherlands. Other large, leased sites include properties located in: Montreal, Canada; Aachen and Ulm, Germany; Shanghai and Chengdu, China; Merelbeke, Belgium; Turin, Italy; Tokyo, Japan and Pune, India.\nWe believe our existing facilities and equipment are in good operating condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nCity of Miami Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Trust Action\nOn February 25, 2022, a purported shareholder class action captioned as City Of Miami Fire Fighters And Police Officers Retirement Trust v. Cerence Inc. et al. (the \"Securities Action\") was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and two of its former officers as defendants. Following the court's selection of a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, an amended complaint was filed on July 26, 2022. The plaintiff claims to be suing on behalf of anyone who purchased the Companys common stock between November 16, 2020 and February 4, 2022. The lawsuit alleges that material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact regarding the Companys operations, financial performance and prospects were made in the Companys public disclosures during the period from November 16, 2020 to February 4, 2022, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorneys fees. We intend to defend the claims vigorously. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action.\nDerivative Actions\nOn May 10 and 12, 2022, respectively, plaintiffs William Shafer and Peter Morse filed shareholder derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of Cerence Inc. against defendants (and former officers) Sanjay Dwahan and Mark J. Gallenberger as well as board members Arun Sarin, Thomas Beaudoin, Marianne Budnik, Sanjay Jha, Kristi Ann Matus, Alfred Nietzel and current CEO and board member Stefan Ortmanns. These actions contain substantially similar factual and legal contentions and, as such, on June 13, 2022, at the parties' request, the court consolidated these derivative actions into a single action (the \"Consolidated Derivative Action\") and appointed Co-Lead Counsel for plaintiffs. In addition, the parties agreed to stay the Consolidated Derivative Action pending a ruling on the forthcoming motion to dismiss in the Securities Action, and the court has ordered that stay.\nOn October 19, 2022, plaintiff Melinda Hipp filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of Cerence Inc. against the defendants named in the Consolidated Derivative Action and board member Douglas Davis. This complaint makes factual and legal contentions substantially similar to those made in the Consolidated Derivative Actions.\nGiven the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, derivative standing and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from these derivative actions.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nSimilar to many companies in the software industry, we are or may become involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including, without limitation, actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, product liability claims, employment, benefits and securities matters. We evaluate the probability of adverse outcomes and, as applicable, estimate the amount of probable losses that may result from pending matters. Probable losses that can be reasonably estimated are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. These recorded amounts are not material to our consolidated financial statements for any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters with certainty, we do not expect the results of any of these actions to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, the actual losses may prove to be larger or smaller than the accruals reflected in our consolidated financial statements, and we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur common stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol CRNC since October 2, 2019. Prior to that date, there was no public trading market for our common stock. A when-issued trading market for our common stock existed between September 17, 2019 and October 1, 2019 under the symbol CRNCV.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of November 15, 2022, there were 486 holders of record of our common stock. This number does not reflect beneficial owners whose shares are held in street name.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not paid any dividends since our formation. We may evaluate whether to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of future dividends to stockholders, if any, will fall within the discretion of our Board. Among the items we would consider in establishing a dividend policy are the capital needs of our business and opportunities to retain future earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth. Additionally, the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities limit our ability to pay cash dividends. There can be no assurance that we will pay a dividend in the future or continue to pay any dividend if we do commence the payment of dividends.\nPerformance Graph\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return of our common stock for the last three years with the S&P MidCap 400, Russell 2000 and the S&P Software & Services Select indices. The information presented assumes an initial investment of $100 on October 2, 2019, the date our common stock began regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

Item 6. Reserved.\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, (the \"MD&A\"), describes the principal factors, based on managements assessment, which have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, as well as our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our MD&A generally includes a discussion of results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources related to year-over-year comparisons between fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, as well as fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020.\nThe following discussion and analysis presented below should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the corresponding notes, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The information presented in this section includes forward-looking statements, which are described in detail in the section titled Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements. The matters discussed in these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those made, projected, or implied in the forward-looking statements. See the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties, and assumptions associated with these statements.\nOverview\nCerence builds AI powered virtual assistants for the mobility/transportation market. Our primary target is the automobile market, but our solutions can apply to all forms of transportation including but not limited to two-wheel vehicles, planes, tractors, cruise ships and elevators. Our solutions power natural conversational and intuitive interactions between automobiles, drivers and passengers, and the broader digital world. We possess one of the worlds most popular software platforms for building automotive virtual assistants. Our customers include all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between automobile brands and end users. Our vision is to enable a more enjoyable, safer journey for everyone.\nOur principal offering is our software platform, which our customers use to build virtual assistants that can communicate, find information and take action across an expanding variety of categories. Our software platform has a hybrid architecture combining edge software components with cloud-connected components. Edge software components are installed on a vehicles head unit and can operate without access to external networks and information. Cloud-connected components are comprised of certain speech and natural language understanding related technologies, AI-enabled personalization and context-based response frameworks, and content integration platform.\nWe generate revenue primarily by selling software licenses and cloud-connected services. Our edge software components are typically sold under a traditional per unit perpetual software license model, in which a per unit fee is charged for each software instance installed on an automotive head unit. We typically license cloud-connected software components in the form of a service to the vehicle end user, which is paid for in advance. In addition, we generate professional services revenue from our work with our customers during the design, development and deployment phases of the vehicle model lifecycle and through maintenance and enhancement projects. We have existing relationships with all major OEMs or their tier 1 suppliers, and while our customer contracts vary, they generally represent multi-year engagements, giving us visibility into future revenue.\nImpact of COVID-19 on our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional governmental restrictions and regulations, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business and financial results. For example, pandemic related lockdowns have been experienced in China throughout fiscal year 2022, which resulted in loss of automotive production. We have seen, and anticipate that we will continue to see, supply chain challenges in the automotive industry related to semiconductor devices that are used in automobiles. The current macroeconomic conditions have also increased competition for qualified employees in our industry, particularly for members of our professional service teams, and we, along with automotive OEMs, face significant competition in hiring and retaining them. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market impact resulting from COVID-19 or other market factors could materially and adversely affect our business, our access to needed capital and liquidity, and the value of our common stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has lessened or subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business and financial performance as a result of its global economic impact.\nAs the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business continues to develop, we are closely monitoring the global situation. We are unable to predict the full impact that COVID-19 will have on our operations, liquidity and financial results, and, depending on the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, such impact may be material. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends. For further discussion of the business risks associated with COVID-19, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Trends\nWe experienced a 15.3% decrease in total revenue during fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by our license and connected services revenues. Our license revenue is highly dependent on vehicle production. Over the course of the past year, third-party light vehicle production forecasts have decreased in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, anticipated economic slowdown, conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the effects of lockdowns in mainland China driven by COVID-19. The decrease in our connected services revenues was primarily driven by the winding down of a legacy contract acquired by Nuance through a 2013 acquisition.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, total cost of revenues decreased by 3.9%, primarily driven by the decline in license and connected services revenues. Total operating expenses increased by 84.1% during fiscal year 2022, primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million. Total operating expenses excluding the goodwill charge decreased 10.7%, primarily driven by our cost savings initiatives. Restructuring and other costs, net increased $3.9 million, driven by the resignation of our former CEO and the resulting modification of certain stock-based awards, severance charges related to the elimination of personnel, and charges resulting from the closure of facilities that will no longer be utilized.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, and the rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the fiscal years presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, as well as those of its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\nKey Metrics\nIn evaluating our financial condition and operating performance, we focus on revenue, operating margins, and cash flow from operations.\nFor the fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021:\nTotal revenue decreased by $59.3 million, or 15.3%, from $387.2 million to $327.9 million.\nOperating margin decreased 71.9 percentage points from 15.7% to -56.2%.\nCash (used in) provided by operating activities changed by $76.5 million, or 102.9%, from cash provided by operating activities of $74.4 million to cash used in operating activities of $2.1 million.\nFor fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020:\nTotal revenue increased by $56.2 million, or 17.0%, from $331.0 million to $387.2 million.\nOperating margin increased by 8.9 percentage points from 6.8% to 15.7%.\nCash provided by operating activities increased by $29.6 million, or 66.1%, from $44.8 million to $74.4 million.\nOperating Results\nThe following table shows the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nRevenues:\nLicense\n$\n158,610\n$\n202,183\n$\n164,268\nConnected services\n85,571\n109,534\n97,469\nProfessional services\n83,710\n75,465\n69,230\nTotal revenues\n327,891\n387,182\n330,967\nCost of revenues:\nLicense\n$\n2,698\n$\n3,544\n$\n2,783\nConnected services\n22,722\n25,727\n31,768\nProfessional services\n68,764\n64,287\n64,963\nAmortization of intangibles\n2,984\n7,516\n8,337\nTotal cost of revenues\n97,168\n101,074\n107,851\nGross profit\n230,723\n286,108\n223,116\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development\n$\n107,116\n$\n112,070\n$\n88,899\nSales and marketing\n31,098\n38,683\n33,398\nGeneral and administrative\n42,653\n56,979\n49,386\nAmortization of intangible assets\n11,516\n12,690\n12,544\nRestructuring and other costs, net\n8,965\n5,092\n16,458\nGoodwill impairment\n213,720\n-\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n415,068\n225,514\n200,685\n(Loss) income from operations\n(184,345\n)\n60,594\n22,431\nInterest income\n1,007\nInterest expense\n(14,394\n)\n(13,997\n)\n(22,737\n)\nOther income (expense), net\n(1,019\n)\n1,563\n(23,319\n)\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n(198,751\n)\n48,269\n(23,040\n)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n112,075\n2,376\n(4,724\n)\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(310,826\n)\n$\n45,893\n$\n(18,316\n)\nOur revenue consists primarily of license revenue, connected services revenue and revenue from professional services. License revenue primarily consists of license royalties associated with our edge software components. Our edge software components are typically sold under a traditional per unit perpetual software license model, in which a per unit fee is charged for each software instance installed on an automotive head unit. Our contracts contain variable, fixed prepaid or fixed minimum purchase commitment components. Revenue is recognized and cash is collected for variable contracts over the license distribution period. The fixed contracts typically provide the customer with a price discount and can include the conversion of a variable contract that is already in our variable backlog. Revenue for fixed contracts is recognized when the software is made available to the customer, which has typically occurred at the time the contract is signed. Cash is typically expected to be collected for a fixed prepaid deal at the inception of the contract. Cash is expected to be collected for a fixed minimum commitment deal over the license distribution period. During fiscal year 2023, we expect a reduction in contributions from our fixed license contracts due to our decision to limit the level of such contracts on a go-forward basis. As a result, we expect a negative impact on reported license revenue for fiscal year 2023. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue, deferred revenue performance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. Costs of license revenue primarily consist of third-party royalty expenses for certain external technologies we leverage.\nConnected services revenue represents the subscription fee that provides access to our connected services components, including the customization and construction of our connected services solutions. We also derive revenue within our connected services business from usage contracts and there can be instances where a customer purchases a software license that allows them to take possession of the software to enable hosting by the customer or a third-party. Subscription and usage contracts typically have a term of one to five years. Subscription revenue is recognized over the subscription period and cash is expected to be collected at the start of the subscription period. Usage based revenue is recognized and cash is collected as the service is used. If the customer takes possession of the software to have it hosted by the customer or a third-party, revenue is recognized, and cash is collected at the time the license is delivered. See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue, deferred revenue\nperformance obligations and the timing of revenue recognition. Cost of connected service revenue primarily consists of labor costs of software delivery services, infrastructure, and communications fees that support our connected services solutions.\nProfessional services revenue is primarily comprised of porting, integrating, and customizing our embedded solutions, with costs primarily consisting of compensation for services personnel, contractors and overhead.\nOur operating expenses include R&D, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. R&D expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, and overhead relating to research and engineering staff. Sales and marketing expenses includes salaries, benefits, and commissions related to our sales, product marketing, product management, and business unit management teams. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs for administration, finance, human resources, general management, fees for external professional advisers including accountants and attorneys, and provisions for credit losses.\nAmortization of acquired patents and core technology are included within cost of revenues whereas the amortization of other intangible assets, such as acquired customer relationships, trade names and trademarks, are included within operating expenses. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nOther components of operating expenses includes restructuring and other costs, net and goodwill impairment. Restructuring and other costs, net include restructuring expenses as well as other charges that are unusual in nature, are the result of unplanned events, and arise outside the ordinary course of our business. Goodwill impairment is recognized on a non-recurring basis when the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value.\nTotal other expense, net consists primarily of foreign exchange gains (losses), losses on the extinguishment of debt and interest expense related to the Existing Facility, Notes, and Senior Credit Facilities.\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2021 and Fiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nTotal Revenues\nThe following table shows total revenues by product type, including the corresponding percentage change (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n% Change\n% Change\n% of Total\n% of Total\n% of Total\n2022 vs. 2021\n2021 vs. 2020\nLicense\n$\n158,610\n48.4%\n$\n202,183\n52.2%\n$\n164,268\n49.6%\n(21.6\n)%\n23.1\n%\nConnected services\n85,571\n26.1%\n109,534\n28.3%\n97,469\n29.5%\n(21.9\n)%\n12.4\n%\nProfessional services\n83,710\n25.5%\n75,465\n19.5%\n69,230\n20.9%\n10.9\n%\n9.0\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n327,891\n$\n387,182\n$\n330,967\n(15.3\n)%\n17.0\n%\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2021\nTotal revenues for fiscal year 2022 were $327.9 million, a decrease of $59.3 million, or 15.3%, from $387.2 million from fiscal year 2021. The decrease in revenues was driven by decreases in licensing revenues and decreased demand for our connected services. Our license revenue is highly dependent on vehicle production. Over the course of the past year, third-party light vehicle production forecasts have decreased in response to the ongoing semiconductor shortage, anticipated economic slowdown, conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the effects of lockdowns in mainland China driven by COVID-19. While we cannot predict the full impact of the forecasted decline in production to our business, we do expect our operating results to be negatively impacted.\nLicense Revenue\nLicense revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $158.6 million, a decrease of $43.6 million, or 21.6%, from $202.2 million for fiscal year 2021. Variable license revenue decreased by $42.9 million primarily due to a lower volume of licensing royalties including consumption from fixed license contracts. During fiscal year 2022, certain existing variable long-term contracts with our largest customer were converted into minimum purchase commitment deals that accounted for $47.1 million of revenue during fiscal year 2022. The estimated future revenue related to these long-term contracts was previously included in our variable backlog. The cash associated with these deals is expected to be collected over the distribution period, which could be up to five years.\nAs a percentage of total revenue, license revenue decreased by 3.8 percentage points from 52.2% for fiscal year 2021 to 48.4% for fiscal year 2022.\nConnected Services Revenue\nConnected services revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $85.6 million, a decrease of $23.9 million, or 21.9%, from $109.5 million for fiscal year 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by the winding down of a legacy contract acquired by Nuance through a 2013 acquisition. As a percentage of total revenue, connected services revenue decreased by 2.2 percentage points from 28.3% for fiscal year 2021 to 26.1% for fiscal year 2022.\nProfessional Services Revenue\nProfessional services revenue for fiscal year 2022 was $83.7 million, an increase of $8.2 million, or 10.9%, from $75.5 million for fiscal year 2021. This increase was primarily driven by our continued focus on integration and customization services related to our edge software and timing of services rendered. As a percentage of total revenue, professional services revenue increased by 6.0 percentage points from 19.5% for fiscal year 2021 to 25.5% for fiscal year 2022.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nTotal revenues for fiscal year 2021 were $387.2 million, an increase of $56.2 million, or 17.0%, from $331.0 million from fiscal year 2020. The increase in revenues occurred across all product types.\nLicense Revenue\nLicense revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $202.2 million, an increase of $37.9 million, or 23.1%, from $164.3 million for fiscal year 2020.

R&D expenses for fiscal year 2022 were $107.1 million, a decrease of $5.0 million, or 4.4%, from $112.1 million for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in R&D expenses was primarily attributable to a $6.3 million decrease in stock-based compensation and $3.9 million decrease in salary-related expenditures. The decrease was partially offset by a $2.9 million decrease in labor allocated to support our customer projects, $1.0 million increase in third-party contractor costs, and $0.6 million increase in hardware and software costs.

The decrease in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a $9.0 million decrease in stock-based compensation and a $0.5 million decrease in salary-related expenses. The decrease was partly offset by an increase of $0.6 million related to travel expenditures and $0.6 million related to commission expense. As a percentage of total operating expenses, sales and marketing expenses decreased by 9.7 percentage points from 17.2% for fiscal year 2021 to 7.5% for fiscal year 2022.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nSales and marketing expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $38.7 million, an increase of $5.3 million, or 15.8%, from $33.4 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to $3.1 million increase in salary-related expenses, $3.0 million increase related to stock-based compensation, and $0.4 million related to commission expenses.

At September 30, 2022, we concluded indicators of impairment were present due to the current macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in our stock price. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. We weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $713.0 million as of September 30, 2022. The carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nRestructuring and other costs, net for fiscal year 2021 were $5.1 million, a decrease of $11.4 million, from $16.5 million for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in restructuring and other costs, net was primarily driven by a $10.6 million decrease in expenditures to establish the Cerence business as a standalone public company.

The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to returns on investments. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to a higher applicable interest rate on our Term Loan Facility. The change in other income (expense), net was primarily driven by foreign exchange losses.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nTotal other expense, net for fiscal year 2021 was $12.3 million, a decrease of $33.2 million from $45.5 million of expense for fiscal year 2020. The decrease in interest expense and other income (expense), net is primarily attributed to our debt refinancing in June 2020.

Consequently, our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2022 was $112.1 million, a net change of $109.7 million, or 4617.0%, from a provision for income taxes of $2.4 million for fiscal year 2021. The effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction, impairment of book goodwill, the tax impacts of stock-based compensation, and our composition of jurisdictional earnings.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nOur effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 4.9%, compared to 20.5% for fiscal year 2020. Consequently, our provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2021 was $2.4 million, a net change of $7.1 million, or 150.3%, from a benefit from income taxes of $4.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2021 differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0% primarily due to our composition of jurisdictional earnings, U.S. inclusions of foreign taxable income as a result of changes in applicable tax laws in 2017, and an income tax benefit of approximately $15.9 million related to an increase in tax rates in the Netherlands enacted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancial Condition\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had $126.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less. Marketable securities include commercial paper, corporate bonds, and government securities. As of September 30, 2022, our net working capital, excluding deferred revenue and deferred costs, was $146.1 million. This balance is representative of the short-term net cash inflows based on the working capital at that date.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we converted existing variable long-term contracts into minimum purchase commitment deals with our largest customer. These minimum commitment deals accounted for $47.1 million of revenues during fiscal year 2022. The cash associated with these deals is expected to be collected over the distribution period, which could be up to five years. The estimated future revenues related to these long-term contracts was previously included in our variable backlog.\nSources and Material Cash Requirements\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash flows we generated from our operations. The primary uses of cash include costs of revenues, funding of R&D activities, capital expenditures and debt obligations.\nOur ability to fund future operating needs will depend on our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations and finance additional funding in the capital markets as needed. Based on our expectation to generate positive cash flows and the $126.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2022, we believe we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations, through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, and available credit via our Revolving Facility (as described below).\nThe following table presents our material cash requirements for future periods:\nMaterial Cash Requirements Due by the Year Ended September 30,\n2024 - 2025\n2026 - 2027\nThereafter\nTotal\nNotes\n$\n-\n$\n175,000\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n175,000\nInterest payable on the Notes (a)\n5,246\n8,768\n-\n-\n14,014\nSenior Credit Facilities\n10,938\n100,000\n-\n-\n110,938\nInterest payable on Senior Credit Facilities (b)\n5,793\n7,472\n-\n-\n13,265\nOperating leases\n5,570\n7,979\n3,214\n17,582\nOperating leases under restructuring (c)\n(84\n)\n-\nFinance leases\n-\n1,308\nTotal material cash requirements\n$\n27,939\n$\n300,261\n$\n3,633\n$\n$\n332,652\n(a)Interest per annum is due and payable semiannually and is determined based on the outstanding principal as of September 30, 2022.\n(b)Interest per annum is due and payable monthly and is determined based on the outstanding principal as of September 30, 2022.\n(c)Contractual lease commitments are shown net of sublease income related to certain facilities. As of September 30, 2022, we anticipate sublease income of $1.6 million through fiscal year 2024.\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit plans that are offered primarily by certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third-party trustees, or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable. The aggregate net liability of our defined benefit plans as of September 30, 2022 was $4.9 million.\nAs the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolve, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs. Should we need to secure additional sources of liquidity, we believe that we could finance our needs through the issuance of equity securities or debt offerings. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain financing through the issuance of equity securities or debt offerings on reasonable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. An extended period of economic disruption could materially affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition, including our ability to meet debt covenants or make payments, and access to sources of liquidity.\n3.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2025\nOn June 2, 2020, in an effort to refinance our debt structure, we issued $175.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the Notes), including the initial purchasers exercise in full of their option to purchase an additional $25.0 million principal amount of the Notes, between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee), in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $169.8 million after deducting transaction costs. We used net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes to repay a portion of our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, dated October 1, 2019, by and among us, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent (the Existing Facility).\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020, at a rate of 3.00% per year. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.\nA holder of Notes may convert all or any portion of its Notes at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if we call such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing.\nThe conversion rate will initially be 26.7271 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $37.42 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its Notes called for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to June 5, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on a redemption date occurring on or after June 5, 2023 and on or before the 31st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes plus accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable.\nAt issuance, we accounted for the Notes by allocating proceeds from the Notes into debt and equity components according to the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be fully or partially settled in cash upon conversion. The initial carrying amount of the debt component, which approximates its fair value, was estimated by using an interest rate for nonconvertible debt, with terms similar to the Notes. The excess of the principal amount of the Notes over the fair value of the debt component was recorded as a debt discount and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. The debt discount is accreted to the carrying value of the Notes over their expected term as interest expense using the interest method. Upon issuance of the Notes, we recorded $155.3 million as debt and $19.7 million as additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity.\nWe incurred transaction costs of $5.6 million relating to the issuance of the Notes. In accounting for these costs, we allocated the costs of the offering between debt and equity in proportion to the fair value of the debt and equity recognized. The transaction costs allocated to the debt component of approximately $5.0 million were recorded as a direct deduction from the face amount of the Notes and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes using the interest method. The transaction costs allocated to the equity component of approximately $0.6 million were recorded as a decrease in additional paid-in capital.\nThe interest expense recognized related to the Notes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nContractual interest expense\n$\n5,246\n$\n5,246\n$\n1,753\nAmortization of debt discount\n3,755\n3,527\n1,131\nAmortization of issuance costs\nTotal interest expense related to the Notes\n$\n9,945\n$\n9,660\n$\n3,169\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and the Notes were not convertible as of September 30, 2022, with no Notes being converted. Whether any of the Notes will be converted in future quarters will depend on the satisfaction of one or more of the conversion conditions in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes at a time when any such Notes are convertible, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn June 12, 2020 (the Financing Closing Date), in connection with our effort to refinance our existing indebtedness, we entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Company (the \"Borrower\"), the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a four-year senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the Term Loan Facility). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan Facility were $123.0 million, which together with proceeds from the Notes was intended to pay in full all indebtedness under the Existing Facility, and paid fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities. We also entered into a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities), which shall be drawn on in the event that our working capital and other cash needs are not supported by our operating cash flow. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions customary for financings of this type. All obligations are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and material real property, including a perfected first-priority pledge of all (or, in the case of foreign subsidiaries or subsidiaries (FSHCO) that own no material assets other than equity interests in foreign subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations or other FSHCOs, 65%) of the equity securities of our subsidiaries held by any loan party, subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations.\nOn December 17, 2020 (the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date), we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment). The Amendment extended the scheduled maturity date of the revolving credit and term facilities from June 12, 2024 to April 1, 2025.\nThe Amendment revised certain interest rates in the Credit Agreement. Following delivery of a compliance certificate for the first full fiscal quarter after the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date, the applicable margins for the revolving credit and term facilities is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.75% or ABR plus 1.75%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.50% or ABR plus 1.50%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.20% or ABR plus 1.00%. As a result of the Amendment, the applicable LIBOR floor was reduced from 0.50% to 0.00%.\nFrom the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date until the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.50%. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. Total interest expense relating to the Senior Credit Facilities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $4.3 million, $4.1 million and $1.5 million, respectively, reflecting the coupon and accretion of the discount.\nIn addition, the quarterly commitment fee required to be paid based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.500%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.450%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.400%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.350%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.300%.\nThe Amendment revised the amount by which we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments. Through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility. From the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, with the balance payable at the maturity date thereof.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at our option without premium or penalty. We may request, and each lender may agree in its sole discretion, to extend the maturity date of all or a portion of the Senior Credit Facilities subject to certain conditions customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreement also contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event that we incur certain types of indebtedness or receives net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, in each case subject to terms and conditions customary for financings of this type.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, to designate subsidiaries as unrestricted, to make certain investments, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, or to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries equity interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, each tested quarterly, (1) a net secured leveraged ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00; (2) a net total leverage ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00; and (3) minimum liquidity of at least $75 million. The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type, including certain customary change of control events. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants.\nOn November 22, 2022 (the \"Amendment No. 2 Effective Date\"), we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (\"Amendment No. 2\"). Amendment No. 2 modified certain financial covenants between the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 to the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the \"covenant adjustment period\"). During the covenant adjustment period, each tested quarterly, we are required to maintain (1) a net secured leveraged ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00; (2) minimum liquidity of at least $125 million; and (3) aggregate capital expenditures less than $7.5 million. The net total leverage ratio will be waived during the covenant adjustment period. At the conclusion of the covenant adjustment period, the original financial covenants will resume.\nAmendment No. 2 revised certain interest rates in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margins for the revolving credit and term facilities is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.75% or ABR plus 1.75%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.50% or ABR plus 1.50%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.20% or ABR plus 1.00%. From the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date until delivery of the first compliance certificate after the covenant adjustment period, the applicable margin will be SOFR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, as reflected in the audited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K, are summarized in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\n% Change\n% Change\n2022 vs. 2021\n2021 vs. 2020\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n$\n(2,138\n)\n$\n74,389\n$\n44,789\n(102.9\n)%\n66.1\n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(10,565\n)\n(41,631\n)\n(30,675\n)\n(74.6\n)%\n35.7\n%\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n(19,606\n)\n(41,505\n)\n121,553\n(52.8\n)%\n(134.1\n)%\nEffect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(1,272\n)\n1,108\n(214.8\n)%\n177.0\n%\nNet changes in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(33,581\n)\n$\n(7,639\n)\n$\n136,067\n339.6\n%\n(105.6\n)%\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Operating Activities\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2021\nNet cash used in operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was $2.1 million, a net change of $76.5 million, or 102.9%, from net cash provided by operating activities of $74.4 million for fiscal year 2021 . The change in cash flows were primarily due to:\nA decrease of $72.5 million from income before non-cash charges;\nA decrease of $21.4 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital primarily related to cash inflows from accounts receivables; and\nAn increase of $17.4 million from changes in deferred revenue.\nDeferred revenue represents a significant portion of our net cash provided by operating activities and, depending on the nature of our contracts with customers, this balance can fluctuate significantly from period to period. We expect our deferred revenue balances to decrease in the future, including due to a wind-down of a legacy connected service relationship with a major OEM, since the majority of cash from the contract has been collected. We do not expect any changes in deferred revenue to affect our ability to meet our obligations.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nNet cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was $74.4 million, an increase of $29.6 million, or 66.1%, from net cash provided by operating activities of $44.8 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to:\nAn increase of $62.0 million from income before non-cash charges;\nA decrease of $22.7 million due to unfavorable changes in working capital primarily related to cash outflows from accrued expenses and other liabilities; and\nA decrease of $9.7 million from changes in deferred revenue.\nDeferred revenue represents a significant portion of our net cash provided by operating activities and, depending on the nature of our contracts with customers, this balance can fluctuate significantly from period to period.

We do not expect any changes in deferred revenue to affect our ability to meet our obligations.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2021\nNet cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year 2022 was $10.6 million, a decrease of $31.0 million, or 74.6%, from $41.6 million for fiscal year 2021. The change in cash flows were driven by:\nAn increase of $31.6 million net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities;\nA decrease of $2.0 million paid in connection with equity investments;\nA decrease of $2.0 million paid related to debt securities; and\nAn increase of $5.4 million in capital expenditures.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nNet cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $41.6 million, an increase of $10.9 million, or 35.7%, from $30.7 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were driven by:\n$26.1 million net purchase of marketable securities for fiscal year 2021;\n$2.6 million paid in connection with equity investments during the fiscal year 2021;\n$2.0 million paid related to debt securities; and\nA decrease of $7.0 million in capital expenditures.\nNet Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing Activities\nFiscal Year 2022 Compared with Fiscal Year 2021\nNet cash used in financing activities for the fiscal year 2022 was $19.6 million, a net change of $21.9 million, from cash used in financing activities of $41.5 million for fiscal year 2021 . The change in cash flows were primarily due to:\n\tAn increase of $24.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock; and\n\tAn increase of $3.2 million in payments of tax related withholdings due to the net settlement of equity awards.\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year 2020\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal year 2021 was $41.5 million, a net change of $163.1 million, from cash provided by financing activities of $121.6 million for fiscal year 2020. The change in cash flows were primarily due to:\n\t$249.7 million proceeds from the issuance of the Existing Facility during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020;\n\t$169.8 million proceeds from the issuance of the Notes during the quarter ended June 30, 2020;\n\t$123.0 million proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Credit Facilities during the quarter ended June 30, 2020;\n\t$271.6 million principal payments of long-term debt during the fiscal year 2020;\n\t$153.0 million distribution paid to Nuance related to our Spin-Off during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020; and\n\t$45.8 million payment of tax related withholdings due to the net settlement of equity awards during the fiscal year 2021.\nIssued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nRefer to Note 2 to the accompanying audited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain issued accounting standards that have not been adopted by us and may impact our results of operations in future reporting periods.\nCritical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition; allowance for credit losses and doubtful accounts; accounting for deferred costs; accounting for internally developed software; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for business combinations; accounting for stock-based compensation; accounting for income taxes; accounting for leases; accounting for convertible debt; and loss contingencies. Our management bases its estimates on historical experience, market participant fair value considerations, projected future cash flows, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of our operations. These policies require our most difficult and subjective judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily derive revenue from the following sources: (1) royalty-based software license arrangements, (2) connected services, and (3) professional services. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We account for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur arrangements with customers may contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct-that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue after applying the following five steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated standalone selling price (SSP) of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP by considering a number of data points, including cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation; types of offerings; and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists.\nWe only include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a corresponding refund liability as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these products or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.\nWe assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component.\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration.\nPerformance Obligations\nLicense\nEmbedded software and technology licenses operate without access to the external networks and information. Embedded licenses sold with non-distinct professional services to customize and/or integrate the underlying software and technology are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue from the combined performance obligation is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.\nRevenue from distinct embedded software and technology licenses, which do not require professional services to customize and/or integrate the software license, is recognized at the point in time when the software and technology is made available to the customer and control is transferred. For income statement presentation purposes, we separate distinct embedded license revenue from professional services revenue based on their relative SSPs.\nRevenue from embedded software and technology licenses sold on a royalty basis, where the license of non-exclusive intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates, is recognized in the period the usage occurs in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65(A).\nFor royalty arrangements that include fixed consideration related to a minimum usage guarantees, the fixed consideration is recognized when the software is made available to the customer.\nConnected Services\nConnected services, which allow our customers to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a usage basis as consumed or on a fixed fee subscription basis. Subscription basis revenue represents a single promise to stand-ready to provide access to our connected services. Our connected services contract terms generally range from one to five years.\nAs each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, we have determined that our connected services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services. These services include variable consideration, typically a function of usage. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e., recognized as incurred).\nOur connected service arrangements generally include services to develop, customize, and stand-up applications for each customer. In determining whether these services are distinct, we consider dependence of the cloud service on the up-front development and stand-up, as well as availability of the services from other vendors. We have concluded that the up-front development, stand-up and customization services are not distinct performance obligations, and as such, revenue for these activities is recognized over the period during which the cloud-connected services are provided, and is included within connected services revenue. There can be instances where the customer purchases a software license that allows them to take possession of the software to enable hosting by the customer or a third-party. For such arrangements, the performance obligation of the license is completed at a point in time once the customer takes possession of the software.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from distinct professional services, including training, is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.\nSignificant Judgments\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Our license contracts often include professional services to customize and/or integrate the licenses into the customers environment. Judgment is required to determine whether the license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with professional services. Furthermore, hybrid contracts that contain both embedded and connected license and professional services are analyzed to determine if the products and services are distinct or have stand-alone functionality to determine the revenue treatment.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated SSP of each distinct performance obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs, when possible. Since our prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, there are instances where the SSP is not directly observable. In such instances, we estimate SSP by considering a number of data points, including cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation; types of offerings; and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists. These factors may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. We review the SSP for each distinct performance obligation on a periodic basis, or when the underlying factors are deemed to have changed, and make updates when appropriate.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nIn conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. The capitalized costs primarily relate to paid commissions. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, we apply a portfolio approach to estimate contract acquisition costs for groups of customer contracts. We elect to apply the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and will expense contract acquisition costs as incurred where the expected period of benefit is one year or less. Contract acquisition costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which we have estimated to be between one and eight years. The period of benefit was determined based on an average customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We assess the amortization term for all major transactions based on specific facts and circumstances. Contract acquisition costs are classified as current or noncurrent assets based on when the expense will be recognized. The current and noncurrent portions of contract acquisition costs are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and in Other assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $8.3 million and $6.9 million of contract acquisition costs. We had amortization expense of $2.5 million, $1.9 million, and $1.5 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020. There was no impairment related to contract acquisition costs.\nCapitalized Contract Costs\nWe capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Our capitalized costs consist primarily of setup costs, such as costs to standup, customize and develop applications for each customer, which are incurred to satisfy our stand-ready obligation to provide access to our connected offerings. These contract costs are expensed to cost of revenue as we satisfy our stand-ready obligation over the contract term which we estimate to be between one and eight years, on average. The contract term was determined based on an\naverage customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology, and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We classify these costs as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current and noncurrent portions of capitalized contract fulfillment costs are presented as Deferred costs.\nWe had amortization expense of $10.2 million, $15.4 million and $12.0 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was no impairment related to contract fulfillment costs capitalized.\nTrade Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances\nWe classify our right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the passage of time is required before payment is due). We present such receivables in Accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their net estimated realizable value. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and other applicable factors.\nOur contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not solely subject to the passage of time. The current and noncurrent portions of contract assets are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets, respectively.\nOur contract liabilities, or deferred revenue, consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenues recognized. We classify deferred revenue as current or noncurrent based on when we expect to recognize the revenues.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the business combination date. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions as of the date of the business acquisition, including fair value estimates such as:\nestimated fair values of intangible assets;\nestimated fair values of legal performance commitments to customers, assumed from the acquiree under existing contractual obligations (classified as deferred revenue) at the date of acquisition;\nestimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquiree; and\nestimated fair value of pre-acquisition contingencies from the acquiree.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, within the measurement period, which is generally one year from the date of acquisition, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed against goodwill in the period the amounts are determined. Adjustments identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded within Acquisition-related costs, net.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\nfuture expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, connected services, other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents;\nexpected costs to develop in-process R&D projects into commercially viable products and the estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;\nthe acquired companys brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period during which the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio; and\ndiscount rates.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.\nIn connection with the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions, we estimate the fair market value of legal performance commitments to customers, which are classified as deferred revenue. The estimated fair market value of these obligations is determined and recorded as of the acquisition date.\nWe may identify certain pre-acquisition contingencies. If, during the purchase price allocation period, we are able to determine the fair values of a pre-acquisition contingencies, we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation. If we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre-acquisition contingency at the end of the measurement period, we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated. Subsequent to the end of the measurement period, any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre-acquisition contingency will be included within acquisition-related cost, net in the period in which the adjustment is determined.\nGoodwill Impairment Analysis\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting units fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. There was no goodwill impairment for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021 and 2020.\nFor the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure. Upon consideration of our components, we have concluded that our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit.\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately.\nDue to macroeconomic conditions, we concluded that indicators of impairment were present and performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of June 30, 2022. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. We weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $995 million as of June 30, 2022. The estimated fair value exceeded the $950 million carrying value of our reporting unit by approximately $45 million, or 5% of the carrying value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of June 30, 2022.\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the annual impairment testing of our goodwill. We elected to rely on a qualitative assessment and as a result we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount.\nAt September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment test. We concluded indicators of impairment were present due to the current macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in our stock price. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows using our multi-year target plan, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. For the market approach, we used a valuation technique in which values were derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies.\nWe weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $713.0 million as of September 30, 2022. The carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nLong-Lived Assets with Definite Lives\nOur long-lived assets consist principally of technology, customer relationships, internally developed software, land, building, and equipment. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Other definite-lived assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives using the straight-line method. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically at the asset group level for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group.\nInternally developed software consists of capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs related to the design of the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software is amortized over the estimated useful life, commencing on the date when the asset is ready for its intended use. Land, building and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or retired assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations for the period.\nLong-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset groups carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. There were no long-lived asset impairments in any of the periods presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe grant equity awards to certain employees which include stock options and restricted stock unit awards in accordance with provisions of the Cerence 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (Equity Incentive Plan).\nWe account for stock-based compensation through recognition of the fair value of the stock-based compensation as a charge against earnings. The fair value for time-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units is based on the closing share price of our common stock on the date of grant. For performance-based restricted stock units, the compensation cost is recognized based on the number of units expected to vest upon the achievement of the performance conditions. We recognize stock-based compensation as an expense on a straight-line basis, over the requisite service period. We account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than applying an estimated forfeiture rate.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the assets and liabilities method, as prescribed by ASC No. 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carry amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowance required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our currency and deferred tax positions.\nAny significant fluctuations in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates.\nWe have historically estimated the future tax consequences of certain items, including bad debts and accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent period when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured used enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the repatriations of such foreign earnings.\nValuation Allowance\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historically profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we established a valuation allowance of $107.6 million against our deferred tax assets in the Netherlands, which consists of tax amortizable intellectual property and net operating loss carryforwards. We determined we had new negative evidence, based on updates to transfer pricing arrangements and changes to the earnings guidance for fiscal year 2022. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our Netherlands deferred tax assets until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed accordingly in the period that such determination is made.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, intercompany transfer and acquisition or divestures. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax laws are complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may own may differ from the amounts recognized.\nLeases\nWe have entered into a number of facility and equipment leases which qualify as operating leases under GAAP. We also have a limited number of equipment leases that also qualify as finance leases. We determine if contracts with vendors represent a lease or have a lease component under GAAP at contract inception. Our leases have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to six years. Some of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes\nof calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nOperating leases are included in Operating lease right of use assets, Short-term operating lease liabilities, and Long-term operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Finance leases are included in Property and equipment, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nLease costs for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For operating leases, costs are included within Cost of revenues, Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For financing leases, amortization of the finance right of use assets is included within Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and interest expense is included within Interest expense.\nFor operating leases, the related cash payments are included in the operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For financing leases, the related cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are included in the financing cash flows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability are included in the operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nConvertible Debt\nWe bifurcate the debt and equity (the contingently convertible feature) components of our convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity components of our convertible debt instruments are recorded within stockholders equity with an allocated issuance premium or discount. The debt issuance premium or discount is amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statement of Operations using the effective interest method over the expected term of the convertible debt.\nWe assess the short-term and long-term classification of our convertible debt on each balance sheet date. Whenever the holders have a contractual right to convert, the carrying amount of the convertible debt is reclassified to current liabilities, with the corresponding equity components classified from additional paid-in-capital to mezzanine equity, as needed.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims relating to labor, service, intellectual property, and other matters that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business. On a quarterly basis, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgments are required for the determination of probability and the range of the outcomes. Due to the inherent uncertainties, estimates are based only on the best information available at the time. Actual outcomes may differ from our estimates. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates. Such revisions may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities, and through the use of derivative financial instruments.\nExchange Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Any foreign currency transaction, defined as a transaction denominated in a currency other than the local functional currency, will be reported in the functional currency at the applicable exchange rate in effect at the time of the transaction. A change in the value of the functional currency compared to the foreign currency of the transaction will have either a positive or negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign entities are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and income and expense items are translated at average rates for the applicable period. Therefore, the change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies will have either a positive or negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. Historically, our primary exposure has been related to transactions denominated in the Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, and Japanese yen.\nWe use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk associated with forecasted foreign denominated payments related to our ongoing business. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts was $63.3 million at September 30, 2022. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in unrealized losses of $5.1 million at September 30, 2022. Such losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk.\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of our cash and cash equivalents and indebtedness related to the Senior Credit Facilities.\nAt September 30, 2022, we held approximately $94.8 million of cash and cash equivalents consisting of cash and highly liquid investments, including money-market funds and time deposits. Assuming a 1% increase in interest rates, our interest income on our money-market funds and time deposits classified as cash and cash equivalents would increase by $0.6 million per annum, based on September 30, 2022 reported balances.\nThe borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities are subject to interest rates based on LIBOR. As of September 30, 2022, assuming a 1% increase in interest rates and our Revolving Facility is fully drawn, our interest expense on our Senior Credit Facilities would increase by approximately $1.6 million per annum. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nIndex to CONSOLIDATED Financial Statements\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 243)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCerence Inc.\nBurlington, Massachusetts\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cerence Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income, consolidated statements of equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated November 29, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nIdentification of Performance Obligations\nAs described in Note 3 to the Companys consolidated financial statements, certain of the Companys revenue contracts contain multiple products and services relating to the sale of connected or embedded licenses and professional services. For these revenue contracts, the Company accounts for the individual products and services separately if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations based on their relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines the standalone selling prices by maximizing observable inputs when available, including pricing of standalone sales, cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation, types of offerings, and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists.\nWe determined that the identification of performance obligations and the recognition of revenue related to contracts that contain multiple performance obligations represents a critical audit matter. The determination of whether multiple services within a contract are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately requires management to exercise significant judgment and includes a high degree of subjectivity. Auditing these elements involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of effort required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\nEvaluating the design and testing operating effectiveness of certain controls relating to managements identification and assessment of distinct performance obligations in contracts with customers.\nEvaluating managements technical accounting policies and practices including the reasonableness of managements judgments and assumptions in the determination of whether the products and services represent distinct performance obligations.\nTesting the reasonableness of the identification of distinct performance obligations through inspection of a sample of customer contracts and other source documents.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys goodwill is associated with one reporting unit. As of September 30, 2022, the Company concluded that indicators of impairment were present due to macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in stock price. A quantitative assessment was performed using a combination of the discounted cashflow method under the income approach and the market approach and the Company determined that the goodwill was impaired and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $213.7 million within the consolidated financial statements. The determination of the fair value of the reporting unit requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future cash flows and the discount rate used in the valuation model.\nWe identified the valuation of goodwill as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination are the inherent uncertainties related to the Companys forecasts and how various factors could affect the Companys assumptions, in particular the revenue forecast and the discount rate specific to the impairment test. Auditing these significant assumptions and judgments involved especially challenging auditor judgment and an increased level of effort, including the extent of specialized skills and knowledge required.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\nEvaluating the design and testing operating effectiveness of certain controls relating to the Companys forecast and goodwill impairment assessment.\nEvaluating the reasonableness of the assumptions used in the income approach, including managements forecast: (i) comparing the forecasts for revenue to historical results, (ii) comparing automotive industry information to the Companys revenue forecast to determine whether contradictory evidence exists, (iii) reviewing the future automotive production reports and projected market share, and (iv) evaluating pricing assumptions for future periods including review of executed contracts in the Companys backlog.\nTesting the completeness and accuracy of the data used by management to develop its forecast.\nUtilizing personnel with specialized knowledge and skills in valuation to assist in: (i) assessing the appropriateness of valuation methods, (ii) testing the mathematical accuracy of the Companys calculations, and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of certain assumptions, including the discount rate used in the income approach.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 29, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCerence Inc.\nBurlington, Massachusetts\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cerence Inc.s (the Companys) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Cerence Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), consolidated statements of equity, and consolidated cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated November 29, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nNovember 29, 2022\nCERENCE INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share

Organization\nHistory\nOn October 1, 2019, (the Distribution Date), Nuance Communications, Inc. (Nuance or the Parent), a leading provider of speech and language solutions for businesses and consumers around the world, completed the complete legal and structural separation and distribution to its stockholders of all of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and its consolidated subsidiaries, in a tax free spin-off (the Spin-Off). The distribution was made in the amount of one share of our common stock for every eight shares of Nuance common stock (the Distribution) owned by Nuances stockholders as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on September 17, 2019, the record date of the Distribution.\nIn connection with the Distribution, on September 30, 2019, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which became effective on October 1, 2019. Our Amended and Restated By-laws also became effective on October 1, 2019. On October 2, 2019, our common stock began regular-way trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol CRNC.\nBusiness\nCerence Inc. (referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company or Cerence) is a global, premier provider of AI-powered assistants and innovations for connected and autonomous vehicles. Our customers include all major automobile original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), or their tier 1 suppliers worldwide. We deliver our solutions on a white-label basis, enabling our customers to deliver customized virtual assistants with unique, branded personalities and ultimately strengthening the bond between automobile brands and end users. We generate revenue primarily by selling software licenses and cloud-connected services. In addition, we generate professional services revenue from our work with OEMs and suppliers during the design, development and deployment phases of the vehicle model lifecycle and through maintenance and enhancement projects.\nCOVID-19 Update\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including orders to close all businesses not deemed essential, isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and practice social distancing.\nWe have taken numerous steps in our approach to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic, and we will continue to closely monitor ongoing developments in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business.\nThe full extent to which the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our financial performance will depend on future developments, many of which are outside of our control, are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and scope of the pandemic, its severity, the emergence of new variants of the virus, such as Omicron; the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional governmental restrictions and regulations, which has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, pandemic related lockdowns have been experienced in China during fiscal year 2022, which resulted in loss of automotive production. We have seen, and anticipate that we will continue to see, supply chain challenges in the automotive industry related to semiconductor devices that are used in automobiles. The current macroeconomic conditions have also increased competition for qualified employees in our industry, particularly for members of our professional service teams, and we, along with automotive OEMs, face significant competition in hiring and retaining them. In addition, a recession, depression or other sustained adverse market impact resulting from COVID-19 could materially and adversely affect our business, our access to needed capital and liquidity, and the value of our common stock. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has lessened or subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts on our business and financial performance as a result of its global economic impact.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(a) Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated results of operations and financial position for the fiscal years presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.\n(b) Principles of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, as well as those of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.\n(c) Use of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the footnotes thereto. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments. Significant estimates inherent to the preparation of financial statements include: revenue recognition; the allowances for credit losses and doubtful accounts; accounting for deferred costs; accounting for internally developed software; the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets; accounting for business combinations; accounting for stock-based compensation; accounting for income taxes; accounting for leases; accounting for convertible debt; and loss contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience, market participant fair value considerations, projected future cash flows, and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates.\n(d) Revenue Recognition\nWe primarily derive revenue from the following sources: (1) royalty-based software license arrangements, (2) connected services, and (3) professional services. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We account for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur arrangements with customers may contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct-that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.\nWe currently recognize revenue after applying the following five steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated SSP of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP by considering a number of data points, including cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation; types of offerings; and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists.\nWe only include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns and other allowances that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a corresponding refund liability as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these product or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.\nWe assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess\nthe existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component.\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration.\n(e) Business Combinations\nWe determine and allocate the purchase price of an acquired company to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. Results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies are included in our operating results from the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation process requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions, which include:\nestimated fair values of intangible assets;\nestimated fair values of legal performance commitments to customers, assumed from the acquiree under existing contractual obligations (classified as deferred revenue);\nestimated income tax assets and liabilities assumed from the acquiree;\nestimated fair value of pre-acquisition contingencies assumed from the acquiree; and\nestimated fair value of any contingent consideration which is established at the acquisition date and included in the total purchase price. The contingent consideration is then adjusted to fair value, with any measurement-period adjustment recorded against goodwill. Adjustments identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded within acquisition-related costs.\nWhile we use our best estimates and assumptions as part of the purchase price allocation process to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business combination date, our estimates and assumptions are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which is generally one year from the acquisition date, any adjustment to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded against goodwill in the period in which the amount is determined. Any adjustment identified subsequent to the measurement period is included in operating results in the period in which the amount is determined.\n(f) Cash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less.\n(g) Marketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist of commercial paper, government securities and corporate bonds. We classify our marketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not yet reached maturity. We classify our marketable securities as either short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security. We record marketable securities at fair value, with the unrealized gains or losses included within Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until realized. Interest income earned from our marketable securities is reported within Interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We evaluate our marketable securities to assess whether those with unrealized loss positions are other than temporarily impaired. We consider impairment to be other than temporary if they are related to deterioration in credit risk or if it is likely we will sell the securities before the recovery of their cost basis. Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary are determined based on the specific identification method and are reported in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(h) Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price in a business combination over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but tested annually for impairment or when indicators of impairment are present. The test for goodwill impairment involves a qualitative assessment of impairment indicators. If indicators are present, a quantitative test of impairment is performed. Goodwill impairment, if any, is determined by comparing the reporting units fair value to its carrying value. An impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the reporting units carrying value over its fair value, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually on July 1, the first day of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. There is no goodwill impairment for the years ended September 30, 2021, and 2020.\nWe believe our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) is our chief operating decision maker (CODM). Our CEO approves all major decisions, including reorganizations and new business initiatives. Our CODM reviews routine consolidated operating information and makes decisions on the allocation of resources at this level, as such, we have concluded that we have one operating segment.\nFor the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, all goodwill acquired in a business combination is assigned to one or more reporting units. A reporting unit represents an operating segment or a component within an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by segment management for performance assessment and resource allocation. Components of similar economic characteristics are aggregated into one reporting unit for the purpose of goodwill impairment assessment. Reporting units are identified annually and re-assessed periodically for recent acquisitions or any changes in segment reporting structure. Upon consideration of our components, we have concluded that our goodwill is associated with one reporting unit.\nThe fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value is determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future after-tax cash flows and estimate the long-term growth rates based on our most recent views of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts. We derive our discount rates using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the weighted average cost of capital. We adjust the discount rates for the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective businesses and in our internally developed forecasts. For the market approach, we use a valuation technique in which values are derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies. We assess each valuation methodology based upon the relevance and availability of the data at the time we perform the valuation and weight the methodologies appropriately.\nDue to macroeconomic conditions, we concluded that indicators of impairment were present and performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of June 30, 2022. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. We weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $995 million as of June 30, 2022. The estimated fair value exceeded the $950 million carrying value of our reporting unit by approximately $45 million, or 5% of the carrying value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of June 30, 2022.\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the annual impairment testing of our goodwill. We elected to rely on a qualitative assessment and as a result we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount.\nAt September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment test. We concluded indicators of impairment were present due to the current macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in our stock price. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows using our multi-year target plan, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. For the market approach, we used a valuation technique in which values were derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies.\nWe weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $713.0 million as of September 30, 2022. The carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n(i) Long-Lived Assets with Definite Lives\nOur long-lived assets consist principally of technology and patents, customer relationships, internally developed software, property and equipment. Customer relationships are amortized over their estimated economic lives based on the pattern of economic benefits expected to be generated from the use of the asset. Other definite-lived assets are amortized over their estimated economic lives using the straight-line method. The remaining useful lives of long-lived assets are re-assessed periodically for any events and circumstances that may change the future cash flows expected to be generated from the long-lived asset or asset group.\nInternally developed software consists of capitalized costs incurred during the application development stage, which include costs to design the software configuration and interfaces, coding, installation and testing. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage, along with post-implementation stages of internally developed software, are expensed as incurred. Internally developed software costs that have been capitalized are typically amortized over the estimated useful life, commencing with the date when an asset is ready for its intended use. Equipment is stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the related remaining lease term or the estimated useful life. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of sold or retired assets are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in the results of operations for the period.\nLong-lived assets with definite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a specific asset or asset group may not be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of long-lived assets with definite lives at the asset group level. Asset groups are determined based upon the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. When the asset group is also a reporting unit, goodwill assigned to the reporting unit is also included in the carrying amount of the asset group. For the purpose of the recoverability test, we compare the total undiscounted future cash flows from the use and disposition of the assets with its net carrying amount. When the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset group is deemed to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss represents the excess of the asset or asset groups carrying value over its estimated fair value, which is generally determined based upon the present value of estimated future pre-tax cash flows that a market participant would expect from use and disposition of the long-lived asset or asset group. There was no impairment of long-lived assets during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n(j) Allowance for Credit Losses\nFiscal year 2022 and 2021\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our sales of software licenses and services to customers. We determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. A credit limit for each customer is established and in certain cases we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk. Our expected loss methodology is developed using historical collection experience, current customer credit information, current and future economic and market conditions and a review of the current status of the customer's account balances. We monitor our ongoing credit\nexposure through reviews of customer balances against contract terms and due dates, current economic conditions, and dispute resolution. Estimated credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible.\nThe change in the allowance for credit losses for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nBalance as of September 30, 2020\n$\n1,394\nCredit loss provision\n(415\n)\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(112\n)\nForeign exchange impact on ending balance\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n$\nCredit loss provision\n(431\n)\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\nForeign exchange impact on ending balance\n(95\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$\nFiscal years 2020\nWe record allowances for doubtful accounts for the estimated probable losses on uncollected accounts receivable. The allowance is based upon the credit worthiness of our customers, our historical experience, the age of the receivable, and current market and economic conditions. Receivables are written off against these allowances in the period they are determined to be uncollectible. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the activity related to the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAllowance for\nDoubtful\nAccounts\nBalance at September 30, 2019\nBad debt provisions\nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(175\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2020\n$\n1,394\n(k) Research and Development\nResearch and development (R&D) costs related to software that is or will be sold or licensed externally to third-parties, or for which a substantive plan exists to sell or license such software in the future, incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to the general release of the product, are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful life of the related products. We have determined that technological feasibility is reached shortly before the general release of the software products. Costs incurred after technological feasibility is established have not been material. R&D costs are otherwise expensed as incurred.\n(l) Income Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the assets and liabilities method, as prescribed by ASC No. 740, Income Taxes, or ASC 740.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. The method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not after consideration of all available evidence. As the income tax returns are not due and filed until after the completion of our annual financial reporting requirements, the amounts recorded for the current period reflect estimates for the tax-based activity for the period. In addition, estimates are often required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state and foreign income tax rates to use, the potential utilization of operating loss carry-forwards and valuation allowance required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realizable in the future. Tax laws and tax rates vary substantially in these jurisdictions and are subject to change given the political and economic climate. We report and pay income tax based on operational results and applicable law. Our tax provision contemplates tax rates currently in effect to determine both our currency and deferred tax positions.\nAny significant fluctuations in rates or changes in tax laws could cause our estimates of taxes we anticipate either paying or recovering in the future to change. Such changes could lead to either increases or decreases in our effective tax rates.\nWe have historically estimated the future tax consequences of certain items, including accruals that cannot be deducted for income tax purposes until such expenses are paid or the related assets are disposed. We believe the procedures and estimates used in our accounting for income taxes are reasonable and in accordance with established tax law. The income tax estimates used have not resulted in material adjustments to income tax expense in subsequent period when the estimates are adjusted to the actual filed tax return amounts.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. With respect to earnings expected to be indefinitely reinvested offshore, we do not accrue tax for the repatriations of such foreign earnings.\nValuation Allowance\nWe regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability considering historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets. The weight given to the positive and negative evidence is commensurate with the extent to which the evidence may be objectively verified. If positive evidence regarding projected future taxable income, exclusive of reversing taxable temporary differences, existed it would be difficult for it to outweigh objective negative evidence of recent financial reporting losses.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we established a valuation allowance of $107.6 million against our deferred tax assets in the Netherlands, which consists of tax amortizable intellectual property and net operating loss carryforwards. We determined we had new negative evidence, based on updates to transfer pricing arrangements and changes to the earnings guidance for fiscal year 2022. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our Netherlands deferred tax assets until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed accordingly in the period that such determination is made.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions through wholly owned subsidiaries and our global structure is complex. The estimates of our uncertain tax positions involve judgments and assessment of the potential tax implications related to legal entity restructuring, intercompany transfer and acquisition or divestures. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Our tax positions are subject to audit by taxing authorities across multiple global jurisdictions and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Tax laws are complex and often subject to varied interpretations, accordingly, the ultimate outcome with respect to taxes we may own may differ from the amounts recognized.\n(m) Accumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Equity, consists of the following (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n$\n(33,895\n)\n$\n3,284\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on post-retirement benefits\n(1,639\n)\nNet unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities\n(436\n)\n(11\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive (loss) income\n$\n(33,737\n)\n$\n1,634\nNo income tax provisions or benefits are recorded for foreign currency translation adjustments as the undistributed earnings in our foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested.\n(n) Concentration of Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of trade accounts receivable. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and limit the amount of credit extended when deemed appropriate. One customer accounted for 17.4% of our Accounts receivable, net balance at September 30, 2022 . One customer accounted for 12.1% of our Accounts receivable, net balance at September 30, 2021.\n(o) Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of a foreign subsidiary is generally the local currency. We translate the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the reporting period for revenues, costs, and expenses. We record translation gains and losses in Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income as a component of stockholders equity. We record net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion of the transaction currency to the functional currency within Other income (expense), net. Foreign currency transaction (gains) losses for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $0.1 million, ($1.7) million, and $2.4 million, respectively.\n(p) Net Parent Investment\nIn the Consolidated Statements of Equity, net parent investment represents the Parents historical investment in the Cerence business, accumulated net earnings after taxes and the net effect of transactions with, and allocations from, the Parent.\n(q) Stock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation primarily consists of restricted stock units with service or market/performance conditions. Equity awards are measured at the fair market value of the underlying stock at the grant date. We recognize stock compensation expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period. We record forfeitures as they occur. For performance-based restricted stock units, the compensation cost is recognized based on the number of units expected to vest upon the achievement of the performance conditions. Shares are issued on the vesting dates net of the applicable statutory tax withholding to be paid by us on behalf of our employees. As a result, fewer shares are issued to the employee than the number of awards outstanding. We record a liability for the tax withholding to be paid by us as a reduction to Additional paid-in capital. We record any income tax effect related to stock-based awards through the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Excess tax benefits are recognized as deferred tax assets upon settlement and are subject to regular review for valuation allowance.\n(r) Leases\nWe have entered into a number of facility and equipment leases which qualify as operating leases under GAAP. We also have a limited number of equipment leases that qualify as financing leases. We determine if contracts with vendors represent a lease or have a lease component under GAAP at contract inception. Our leases have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to six years. Some of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nOperating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, we use an estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular location and currency environment.\nOperating leases are included in Operating lease right of use assets, Short-term operating lease liabilities, and Long-term operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. Finance leases are included in Property and equipment, net, Accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and Other liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nLease costs for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For operating leases, costs are included within Cost of revenues, Research and development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For financing leases, amortization of the finance right of use assets is included within Research and Development, Sales and marketing, and General and administrative lines on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, and interest expense is included within Interest expense.\nFor operating leases, the related cash payments are included in the operating cash flows on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For financing leases, the related cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability are included in the financing cash\nflows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and the related cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability are included within the operating section of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\n(s) Convertible Debt\nWe bifurcate the debt and equity (the contingently convertible feature) components of our convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the time of issuance. The equity components of our convertible debt instruments are recorded within stockholders equity with an allocated issuance premium or discount. The debt issuance premium or discount is amortized to Interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations using the effective interest method over the expected term of the convertible debt.\nWe assess the short-term and long-term classification of our convertible debt on each balance sheet date. Whenever the holders have a contractual right to convert, the carrying amount of the convertible debt is reclassified to current liabilities, with the corresponding equity component classified from additional paid-in capital to mezzanine equity, as needed.\n(t) Net (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net (loss) income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) income per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares, giving effect to potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist of restricted stock units, contingently issuable shares, and potential issuance of stock upon conversion of our Notes, as more fully described in Note 17. The dilutive effect of the Notes is reflected in net (loss) income per share by application of the if-converted method. The if-converted method is only assumed in periods where such application would be dilutive. In applying the if-converted method for diluted net (loss) income per share, we would assume conversion of the Notes at a ratio of 26.7271 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. Assumed converted shares of our common stock are weighted for the period the Notes were outstanding.\n(u) Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\nNone.\n(v) Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB and are adopted by us as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, or do not apply to our operations.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, (ASU 2020-04). The update provides optional guidance for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) contract modifications on financial reporting, caused by reference rate reform. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity, (ASU 2020-06). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for debt with conversion options, revises the criteria for applying the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entitys own equity, and improves the consistency for the calculation of earnings per share. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, our fiscal year 2023. ASU 2020-06 is applicable to our 3.00% Senior Convertible Notes due 2025.\nWe will adopt the new standard effective October 1, 2022 under the modified retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 relating to Long-term debt, Additional paid-in capital, and Other liabilities. We do not expect the adoption of the new standard to have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows. We expect applying ASU 2020-06 will have a cumulative-effect adjustment to Accumulated deficit as of October 1, 2022.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nWe primarily derive revenue from the following sources: (1) royalty-based software license arrangements, (2) connected services, and (3) professional services. Revenue is reported net of applicable sales and use tax, value-added tax and other transaction taxes imposed on the related transaction including mandatory government charges that are passed through to our customers. We\naccount for a contract when both parties have approved and committed to the contract, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nOur arrangements with customers may contain multiple products and services. We account for individual products and services separately if they are distinct-that is, if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the contract and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.\nWe recognize revenue after applying the following five steps:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract, including whether they are distinct within the context of the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated SSP of each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs, when possible. Since prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, in instances where the SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP by considering a number of data points, including cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation; types of offerings; and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists.\nWe only include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We reduce transaction prices for estimated returns and other allowances that represent variable consideration under ASC 606, which we estimate based on historical return experience and other relevant factors, and record a corresponding refund liability as a component of Accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Other forms of contingent revenue or variable consideration are infrequent.\nRevenue is recognized when control of these product or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products or services.\nWe assess the timing of the transfer of products or services to the customer as compared to the timing of payments to determine whether a significant financing component exists. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-32-18, we do not assess the existence of a significant financing component when the difference between payment and transfer of deliverables is a year or less. If the difference in timing arises for reasons other than the provision of finance to either the customer or us, no financing component is deemed to exist. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our services, not to receive or provide financing from or to customers. We do not consider set-up fees nor other upfront fees paid by our customers to represent a financing component.\nReimbursements for out-of-pocket costs generally include, but are not limited to, costs related to transportation, lodging and meals. Revenue from reimbursed out-of-pocket costs is accounted for as variable consideration.\n(a) Performance Obligations\nLicenses\nEmbedded software and technology licenses operate without access to the external networks and information. Embedded licenses sold with non-distinct professional services to customize and/or integrate the underlying software and technology are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. Revenue from the combined performance obligation is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.\nRevenue from distinct embedded software and technology licenses, which do not require professional services to customize and/or integrate the software license, is recognized at the point in time when the software and technology is made available to the customer and control is transferred. For income statement presentation purposes, we separate distinct embedded license revenue from professional services revenue based on their relative SSPs.\nRevenue from embedded software and technology licenses sold on a royalty basis, where the license of non-exclusive intellectual property is the predominant item to which the royalty relates, is recognized in the period the usage occurs in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-65(A).\nFor royalty arrangements that include fixed consideration related to a minimum usage guarantees, the fixed consideration is recognized when the software is made available to the customer.\nConnected Services\nConnected services, which allow our customers to use the hosted software over the contract period without taking possession of the software, are provided on a usage basis as consumed or on a fixed fee subscription basis. Subscription basis revenue represents a single promise to stand-ready to provide access to our connected services. Our connected services contract terms generally range from one to five years.\nAs each day of providing services is substantially the same and the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits as access is provided, we have determined that our connected services arrangements are a single performance obligation comprised of a series of distinct services. These services include variable consideration, typically a function of usage. We recognize revenue as each distinct service period is performed (i.e., recognized as incurred).\nOur connected service arrangements generally include services to develop, customize, and stand-up applications for each customer. In determining whether these services are distinct, we consider dependence of the cloud service on the up-front development and stand-up, as well as availability of the services from other vendors. We have concluded that the up-front development, stand-up and customization services are not distinct performance obligations, and as such, revenue for these activities is recognized over the period during which the cloud-connected services are provided, and is included within Connected services revenue. There can be instances where the customer purchases a software license that allows them to take possession of the software to enable hosting by the customer or a third-party. For such arrangements, the performance obligation of the license is completed at a point in time once the customer takes possession of the software.\nProfessional Services\nRevenue from distinct professional services, including training, is recognized over time based upon the progress towards completion of the project, which is measured based on the labor hours already incurred to date as compared to the total estimated labor hours.\n(b) Significant Judgments\nDetermining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Our license contracts often include professional services to customize and/or integrate the licenses into the customers environment. Judgment is required to determine whether the license is considered distinct and accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with professional services. Furthermore, hybrid contracts that contain both embedded and connected license and professional services are analyzed to determine if the products and services are distinct or have stand-alone functionality to determine the revenue treatment.\nWe allocate the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated SSP of each distinct performance obligation. Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. In determining SSP, we maximize observable inputs, when possible. Since our prices vary from customer to customer based on customer relationship, volume discount and contract type, there are instances where the SSP is not directly observable. In such instances, we estimate SSP by considering a number of data points, including cost of developing and supplying each performance obligation; types of offerings; and gross margin objectives and pricing practices, such as contractually stated prices, discounts offered, and applicable price lists. These factors may vary over time, depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. We review the SSP for each distinct performance obligation on a periodic basis, or when the underlying factors are deemed to have changed, and make updates when appropriate.\n(c) Disaggregated Revenue\nRevenues, classified by the major geographic region in which our customers are located, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenues:\nUnited States\n$\n100,564\n$\n135,033\n$\n129,338\nOther Americas\nGermany\n74,550\n114,936\n100,674\nOther Europe, Middle East and Africa\n15,579\n29,964\n25,394\nJapan\n74,480\n62,840\n50,936\nOther Asia-Pacific\n62,619\n44,234\n24,609\nTotal net revenues\n$\n327,891\n$\n387,182\n$\n330,967\nRevenues within the United States, Germany, and Japan accounted for more than 10% of revenue for all periods presented.\nRevenues relating to two customers accounted for $55.4 million, or 16.9%, and $48.9 million, or 14.9% of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. During fiscal year 2022, certain existing variable long-term contracts with our largest customer were converted into minimum purchase commitment deals. The estimated future revenues related to these long-term contracts was previously included in our variable backlog, which includes estimated future revenues from variable forecasted revenues related to our embedded and connected business. The minimum purchase commitment deals accounted for $47.1 million of revenue for fiscal year 2022. The cash associated with these deals is expected to be collected over the distribution period, which could be up to five years.\nRevenues relating to two customers accounted for $72.0 million, or 18.6%, and $41.6 million, or 10.8% of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Revenues relating to one customer accounted for $76.9 million, or 23.2%, of revenue for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\n(d) Contract Acquisition Costs\nIn conjunction with the adoption of ASC 606, we are required to capitalize certain contract acquisition costs. The capitalized costs primarily relate to paid commissions. In accordance with the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-10-4, we apply a portfolio approach to estimate contract acquisition costs for groups of customer contracts. We elect to apply the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4 and will expense contract acquisition costs as incurred where the expected period of benefit is one year or less. Contract acquisition costs are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit, which we have estimated to be, on average, between one and eight years. The period of benefit was determined based on an average customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We assess the amortization term for all major transactions based on specific facts and circumstances. Contract acquisition costs are classified as current or noncurrent assets based on when the expense will be recognized. The current and noncurrent portions of contract acquisition costs are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, and in Other assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $8.3 million and $6.9 million of contract acquisition costs. We had amortization expense of $2.5 million, $1.9 million and $1.5 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020. There was no impairment related to contract acquisition costs.\n(e) Capitalized Contract Costs\nWe capitalize incremental costs incurred to fulfill our contracts that (i) relate directly to the contract, (ii) are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy our performance obligation under the contract, and (iii) are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contract. Our capitalized costs consist primarily of setup costs, such as costs to standup, customize and develop applications for each customer, which are incurred to satisfy our stand-ready obligation to provide access to our connected offerings. These contract costs are expensed to cost of revenue as we satisfy our stand-ready obligation over the contract term which we estimate to be between one and eight years, on average. The contract term was determined based on an average customer contract term, expected contract renewals, changes in technology, and our ability to retain customers, including canceled contracts. We classify these costs as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize the expense. The current and noncurrent portions of capitalized contract fulfillment costs are presented as Deferred costs.\nWe had amortization expense of $10.2 million, $15.4 million and $12.0 million related to these costs during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There was no impairment related to contract costs capitalized.\n(f) Trade Accounts Receivable and Contract Balances\nWe classify our right to consideration in exchange for deliverables as either a receivable or a contract asset. A receivable is a right to consideration that is unconditional (i.e. only the passage of time is required before payment is due). We present such receivables in Accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their net estimated realizable value. We maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables and contract assets that may not be collected. The allowance is based upon an assessment of customer creditworthiness, historical payment experience, the age of outstanding receivables and other applicable factors.\nOur contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nContract assets include unbilled amounts from long-term contracts when revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer, and right to payment is not solely subject to the passage of time. The current and noncurrent portions of contract assets are\nincluded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and in Other assets, respectively.

Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net (loss) income by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, increased to include the number of shares of common stock that would have been outstanding had potential dilutive shares of common stock been issued. The dilutive effect of restricted stock units is reflected in diluted net (loss) income per share by applying the treasury stock method.\nThe dilutive effect of the Notes (as defined in Note 17) is reflected in net (loss) income per share by application of the if-converted method. The if-converted method is only assumed in periods where such application would be dilutive. In applying the if-converted method for diluted net (loss) income per share, we would assume conversion of the Notes at a ratio of 26.7271 shares\nof our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. Assumed converted shares of our common stock are weighted for the period the Notes were outstanding.\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the numerator and denominator for calculating net (loss) income per share:\nSeptember 30,\nin thousands, except per share data\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(310,826\n)\n$\n45,893\n$\n(18,316\n)\nDenominator:\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n39,187\n37,752\n36,428\nDilutive effect of restricted stock awards\n-\n1,405\n-\nDilutive effect of contingently issuable stock awards\n-\n-\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n39,187\n39,289\n36,428\nNet (loss) income per common share:\nBasic\n$\n(7.93\n)\n$\n1.22\n$\n(0.50\n)\nDiluted\n$\n(7.93\n)\n$\n1.17\n$\n(0.50\n)\nWe exclude weighted-average potentially issuable shares from the calculations of diluted net (loss) income per share during the applicable periods because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Fair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Valuation techniques must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. When determining fair value measurements for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe classification of a financial asset or liability within the hierarchy is based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as of the measurement date as follows:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.\nThe following table presents information about our financial assets that are measured at fair value and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs used (dollars in thousands) as of:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFair Value\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nMarketable Securities\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds $59,146 at cost (a)\n$\n59,138\n$\n59,138\n$\n-\nGovernment securities $4,976 at cost (b)\n4,892\n-\n4,892\nLevel 2:\nGovernment securities $2,377 at cost (b)\n2,361\n-\n2,361\nTime deposits, $1,472 at cost (a)\n1,472\n1,472\n-\nCommercial paper, $7,648 at cost (b)\n7,647\n-\n7,647\nCorporate bonds, $17,328 at cost (b)\n17,001\n-\n17,001\nDebt securities, $2,000 at cost (c)\n2,000\n-\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n94,511\n$\n60,610\n$\n31,901\nSeptember 30, 2021\nFair Value\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nMarketable Securities\nLevel 1:\nMoney market funds (a)\n$\n75,873\n$\n75,873\n$\n-\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits, $2,965 at cost (a)\n2,965\n2,965\n-\nCommercial paper, $18,080 at cost (b)\n18,080\n-\n18,080\nCorporate bonds, $19,704 at cost (b)\n19,694\n-\n19,694\nDebt securities, $2,000 at cost (c)\n2,000\n-\n-\nTotal assets\n$\n118,612\n$\n78,838\n$\n37,774\n(a)Money market funds and other highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less are included within Cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)Government securities, commercial paper and corporate bonds with original maturities greater than 90 days are included within Marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and classified as current or noncurrent based upon whether the maturity of the financial asset is less than or greater than 12 months.\n(c)Debt securities are included within Prepaid and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and classified as current given the maturity of the financial asset is less than 12 months.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded unrealized losses related to our marketable securities of $0.4 million within Accumulated other comprehensive income. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, we recorded an immaterial amount of unrealized losses related to our marketable securities.\nThe carrying amounts of certain financial instruments, including cash held in banks, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities and are excluded from the fair value tables above.\nDerivative financial instruments are recognized at fair value and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 - Derivative Financial Instruments for additional details.\nLong-term debt\nThe estimated fair value of our Long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based on observable market data including prices for similar instruments. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the estimated fair value of our Notes was $155.3 million and $469.0 million, respectively. The Notes are recorded at face value less unamortized debt discount and transaction costs on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amount of the Senior Credit Facilities (as defined in Note 17) approximates fair value given the underlying interest rate applied to such amounts outstanding is currently set to the prevailing market rate.\nEquity securities\nWe have non-controlling equity investment in privately held companies. We evaluated the equity investments under the voting model and concluded consolidation was not applicable. We accounted for the investments by electing the measurement alternative for investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. The non-marketable equity securities are carried at cost less any impairment, plus or minus adjustments resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, which is recorded within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments without readily determinable fair values were $3.1 million and $2.6 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These investments are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. There have been no adjustments to the carrying value of the investment resulting from impairments or observable price changes.\n6. Derivative Financial Instruments\nWe operate internationally and, in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates related to third-party vendor and intercompany payments for goods and services within our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We use foreign exchange forward contracts that are not designated as hedges to manage currency risk. The contracts can have maturities up to three years. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the total notional amount of forward contracts was $63.3 million and $61.0 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately 10.5 and 11.9 months, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for derivative instruments as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nFair Value\nDerivatives not designated as hedges\nClassification\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nForeign currency forward contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n1,627\n$\n1,235\nForeign currency forward contracts\nOther assets\nForeign currency forward contracts\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n1,812\nForeign currency forward contracts\nOther liabilities\nThe following tables display a summary of the income related to foreign currency forward contracts within the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousand):\nGain recognized in earnings\nYear Ended September 30,\nDerivatives not designated as hedges\nClassification\nForeign currency forward contracts\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n$\n2,512\n$\n-\n7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n(a) Goodwill\nDue to macroeconomic conditions, we concluded that indicators of impairment were present and performed an interim quantitative impairment test as of June 30, 2022. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. We weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $995 million as of June 30, 2022. The estimated fair value exceeded the $950 million carrying value of our reporting unit by approximately $45 million, or 5% of the carrying value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of June 30, 2022.\nOn July 1, 2022, we completed the annual impairment testing of our goodwill. We elected to rely on a qualitative assessment and as a result we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount.\nAt September 30, 2022, we performed a quantitative impairment test. We concluded indicators of impairment were present due to the current macroeconomic conditions, including continued declines in our stock price. The fair value of our reporting unit was determined using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. For the income approach, fair value was determined based on the present value of estimated future after-tax cash flows using our multi-year target plan, discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted rate. For the market approach, we used a valuation technique in which values were derived based on valuation multiples of comparable publicly traded companies.\nWe weighted the methodologies appropriately to estimate a fair value of approximately $713.0 million as of September 30, 2022. The carrying value of our reporting unit exceeded the estimated fair value. Based upon the results of the impairment test, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $213.7 million within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTotal\nBalance as of October 1, 2020\n$\n1,128,198\nEffect of foreign currency translation\nBalance as of September 30, 2021\n1,128,511\nGoodwill impairment\n(213,720\n)\nEffect of foreign currency translation\n(23,989\n)\nBalance as of September 30, 2022\n$\n890,802\n(b) Intangible Assets, Net\nOn September 30, 2022, we concluded that indicators of impairment were present and performed a test for recoverability of our long-lived asset group as of September 30, 2022. Based upon the results of the recoverability test, we determined that the carrying amounts of the long-lived asset group were considered recoverable, concluding the test and resulting in no impairment of our long-lived asset group as of September 30, 2022.\nThe following tables summarizes the gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of intangible assets by major class (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2022\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nCarrying\nAmount\nWeighted Average\nRemaining Life\n(Years)\nCustomer relationships\n$\n104,498\n$\n(95,315\n)\n$\n9,183\n1.7\nTechnology and patents\n88,600\n(88,083\n)\n1.2\nTotal\n$\n193,098\n$\n(183,398\n)\n$\n9,700\nSeptember 30, 2021\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nCarrying\nAmount\nWeighted Average\nRemaining Life\n(Years)\nCustomer relationships\n$\n110,485\n$\n(88,638\n)\n$\n21,847\n2.2\nTechnology and patents\n90,738\n(87,237\n)\n3,501\n0.9\nTotal\n$\n201,223\n$\n(175,875\n)\n$\n25,348\nAmortization expense for acquired technology and patents is included in the cost of revenue in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to $3.0 million, $7.5 million, and $8.3 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Leases\nWe have entered into a number of facility and equipment leases which qualify as operating leases under GAAP. We also have a limited number of equipment leases that qualify as finance leases. We determine if contracts with vendors represent a lease or have a lease component under GAAP at contract inception. Our leases have remaining terms ranging from less than one year to six years. Some of our leases include options to extend or terminate the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nOperating lease right of use assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. As our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate, we use an estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular location and currency environment.\nThe following table presents certain information related to lease term and incremental borrowing rates for leases as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in months):\nOperating leases\n46.5\n52.2\nFinance leases\n35.6\n47.1\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n3.7\n%\n5.1\n%\nFinance leases\n4.4\n%\n4.4\n%\nThe following table presents the lease-related assets and liabilities reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nClassification\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nAssets\nOperating lease assets\nOperating lease right of use assets\n$\n14,702\n$\n14,901\nFinance lease assets\nProperty and equipment, net\n1,259\n1,700\nTotal lease assets\n$\n15,961\n$\n16,601\nLiabilities\nCurrent\nOperating\nShort-term operating lease liabilities\n$\n5,071\n$\n4,562\nFinance\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nNoncurrent\nOperating\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n$\n11,375\n$\n12,216\nFinance\nOther liabilities\n1,234\nTotal lease liability\n$\n17,689\n$\n18,442\nThe following table presents lease expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nFinance lease costs:\nAmortization of right of use asset\n$\n$\n$\nInterest on lease liability\nOperating lease cost\n6,788\n7,619\n8,245\nVariable lease cost\n3,492\n2,142\n1,060\nSublease income\n(187\n)\n(207\n)\n(206\n)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n10,578\n$\n10,027\n$\n9,376\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 cash payments related to operating leases were $6.7 million, $7.8 million and $8.0 million, respectively.

Stockholders Equity\nShare-based Compensation Plans\nPer the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which was adopted on October 1, 2019, 600,000,000 shares of capital stock have been authorized, consisting of 40,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or (Preferred Stock), and 560,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Common Stock).\nOn October 2, 2019, we registered the issuance of 6,350,000 shares of Common Stock, consisting of 5,300,000 shares of Common Stock reserved under the Cerence 2019 Equity Incentive Plan, (Equity Incentive Plan), and 1,050,000 shares of Common Stock that are reserved for issuance under the Cerence 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The Equity Incentive Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, stock awards, stock units, stock appreciation rights, and certain other stock-based awards. The shares available for issuance will automatically increase on January 1st of each year, by the lesser of (A) three percent (3%) of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the close of business on the immediately preceding December 31st; and (B) the number of shares of Common Stock determined by the Board on or prior to such date for such year. Awards issued under the Plan may not have a term greater than ten years from the date of grant.\nRestricted Awards\nThe fair value of Restricted Awards, including Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock, is measured based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Restricted Awards generally vest over a period of two to four years. We also include certain Restricted Awards with vesting solely dependent on the achievement of specified performance targets. The fair value of Restricted Awards is amortized to expense over the awards applicable requisite service period. In the event that the employees employment with us terminates, or in the case of awards with only performance targets, if those targets are not met, any unvested shares are forfeited.\nIn fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we withheld payroll taxes totaling $49.0 million, $46.0 million and $9.4 million, respectively, related to the vesting of Restricted Awards.\nRestricted Units are not included in issued and outstanding common stock until the shares are vested and released. The table below summarizes activity related to Restricted Stock Units:\nNon-Vested Restricted Stock Units\nTime-Based\nShares\nPerformance-\nBased Shares\nTotal Shares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in thousands)\nNon-vested at September 30, 2021\n1,420,532\n654,619\n2,075,151\n$\n44.20\nGranted\n808,938\n390,025\n1,198,963\n$\n69.43\nVested\n(1,029,854\n)\n(474,681\n)\n(1,504,535\n)\n$\n58.70\nForfeited\n(203,600\n)\n(134,968\n)\n(338,568\n)\n$\n54.35\nNon-vested at September 30, 2022\n996,016\n434,995\n1,431,011\n$\n62.49\n0.70\n$\n22,524\nExpected to vest\n1,431,011\n$\n62.49\n0.70\n$\n22,524\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn October 2, 2019, we adopted the ESPP and approved 1,050,000 shares for issuance under this plan. The ESPP is administered by our Board of Directors Compensation Committee.\nThe ESPP provides for the issuance of shares of our common stock to participating employees. At the end of each designated offering period, which occurs every six months on February 15 and August 15, employees can elect to purchase shares of our common stock with contributions of up to 12% of their base pay, accumulated via payroll deductions, at an amount equal to 85% of the lower of our stock price on (i) the first day of the offering period, or (ii) the last day of the offering period.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of shares issued under the ESPP. The Black-Scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values. The following table sets forth the weighted-average key assumptions and fair value results for shares issued under the ESPP during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nYear Ended September 30,\nExpected dividend yield\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.41\n%\n0.10\n%\n1.56\n%\nExpected volatility\n69.58\n%\n96.61\n%\n58.18\n%\nExpected life (in years)\n0.50\n0.50\n0.50\nWeighted-average fair value of shares issued (per share)\n$\n27.54\n$\n35.13\n$\n8.93\nThe following table sets forth the quantities and average prices of shares issued under the ESPP for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nYear Ended September 30,\nShares issued under the ESPP\n80,417\n44,172\n63,503\nAverage price of shares issued\n$\n28.18\n$\n73.40\n$\n20.66\nStock-based Compensation\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognize stock-based compensation expenses over the requisite service periods. Our share-based awards are classified within equity. Stock-based compensation for the anticipated Restricted Awards has been adjusted to reflect our estimated achievement under the modified targets and is recorded prospectively over the requisite service period.\nThe amounts included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations related to stock-based compensation are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nCost of connected services\n$\n$\n$\n1,382\nCost of professional services\n3,267\n4,895\n4,191\nResearch and development\n10,196\n16,538\n13,944\nSales and marketing\n3,569\n12,533\n9,580\nGeneral and administrative\n6,545\n25,724\n18,188\nRestructuring and other costs, net\n4,000\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n28,076\n$\n60,555\n$\n47,285\nFor the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we had lower stock-based compensation expense relating to our performance-based restricted stock units. Compensation cost for our performance-based restricted stock units is recognized based on the number of units expected to vest upon the achievement of the performance conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded $4.0 million, net of $5.0 million in forfeitures, in stock-based compensation due to the resignation of our former CEO and the resulting modification of certain stock-based awards in Restructuring and other costs, net. We recorded $2.4 million, net of $0.2 million in forfeitures, in stock-based compensation due to the retirement of our former CFO and resignation of our former General Counsel and the resulting modification of certain stock-based awards.\n13. Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation and Other Claims\nSimilar to many companies in the software industry, we are involved in a variety of claims, demands, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time relating to matters incidental to the ordinary course of our business, including at times actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, employment, benefits and securities matters. At each balance sheet date, we evaluate contingent liabilities associated with these matters in accordance with ASC 450 Contingencies. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgments are required for the determination of probability and the range of the outcomes, and estimates are based only on the best information available at the time. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in claims and legal proceedings and in estimating losses that may arise, actual outcomes may differ from our estimates. Contingencies deemed not probable or for which losses were not estimable in one period may become probable, or losses may become estimable in later periods, which may have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. As of September 30, 2022, accrued losses were not material to our consolidated financial statements, and we do not expect any pending matter to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nCity of Miami Fire Fighters and Police Officers Retirement Trust Action\nOn February 25, 2022, a purported shareholder class action captioned as City Of Miami Fire Fighters And Police Officers Retirement Trust v. Cerence Inc. et al. (the \"Securities Action\") was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, naming the Company and two of its former officers as defendants. Following the court's selection of a lead plaintiff and lead counsel, an amended complaint was filed on July 26, 2022. The plaintiff claims to be suing on behalf of anyone who purchased the Companys common stock between November 16, 2020 and February 4, 2022. The lawsuit alleges that material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact regarding the Companys operations, financial performance and prospects were\nmade in the Companys public disclosures during the period from November 16, 2020 to February 4, 2022, in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including attorneys fees. We intend to defend the claims vigorously. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from this action.\nDerivative Actions\nOn May 10 and 12, 2022, respectively, plaintiffs William Shafer and Peter Morse filed shareholder derivative complaints in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts on behalf of Cerence Inc. against defendants (and former officers) Sanjay Dwahan and Mark J. Gallenberger as well as board members Arun Sarin, Thomas Beaudoin, Marianne Budnik, Sanjay Jha, Kristi Ann Matus, Alfred Nietzel and current CEO and board member Stefan Ortmanns. These actions contain substantially similar factual and legal contentions and, as such, on June 13, 2022, at the parties' request, the court consolidated these derivative actions into a single action (the \"Consolidated Derivative Action\") and appointed Co-Lead Counsel for plaintiffs. In addition, the parties agreed to stay the Consolidated Derivative Action pending a ruling on the forthcoming motion to dismiss in the Securities Action, and the court has ordered that stay.\nOn October 19, 2022, plaintiff Melinda Hipp filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery on behalf of Cerence Inc. against the defendants named in the Consolidated Derivative Action and board member Douglas Davis. This complaint makes factual and legal contentions substantially similar to those made in the Consolidated Derivative Actions.\nGiven the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, derivative standing and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may result from these derivative actions.\nGuarantees and Other\nWe include indemnification provisions in the contracts we enter with customers and business partners. Generally, these provisions require us to defend claims arising out of our products infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, breach of contractual obligations and/or unlawful or otherwise culpable conduct. The indemnity obligations generally cover damages, costs and attorneys fees arising out of such claims. In most, but not all cases, our total liability under such provisions is limited to either the value of the contract or a specified, agreed-upon amount. In some cases, our total liability under such provisions is unlimited. In many, but not all cases, the term of the indemnity provision is perpetual. While the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under all the indemnification provisions is unlimited, we believe the estimated fair value of these provisions is minimal due to the low frequency with which these provisions have been triggered.\nWe indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, which provides among other things, indemnification to directors and officers for expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and settlement amounts incurred by such persons in their capacity as a director or officer of the Company, regardless of whether the individual is serving in any such capacity at the time the liability or expense is incurred. Additionally, in connection with certain acquisitions, we agreed to indemnify the former officers and members of the boards of directors of those companies, on similar terms as described above, for a period of six years from the acquisition date. In certain cases, we purchase director and officer insurance policies related to these obligations, which fully cover the six-year period. To the extent that we do not purchase a director and officer insurance policy for the full period of any contractual indemnification, and such directors and officers do not have coverage under separate insurance policies, we would be required to pay for costs incurred, if any, as described above.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have a $0.9 million letter of credit that is used as a security deposit in connection with our leased Bellevue, Washington office space. In the event of default on the underlying lease, the landlord would be eligible to draw against the letter of credit. The letter of credit is subject to aggregate reductions, provided that we are not in default under the underlying lease. We also have letters of credit in connection with security deposits for other facility leases totaling $0.5 million in the aggregate. These letters of credit have various terms and expire during fiscal year 2023 and beyond, while some of the letters of credit may automatically renew based on the terms of the underlying agreements.\n14. Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe have established a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k) Plan). The 401(k) Plan covers substantially all of our U.S. employees who meet minimum age and service requirements, and allows participants to defer a portion of their annual compensation on a pre-tax basis. We match 50% of employee contributions up to 6% of eligible\nsalary. We incurred charges for contributions to these 401(k) defined contribution plans of $0.5 million, $0.7 million, and $0.7 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe sponsor certain defined benefit pension plans that are offered primarily by our foreign subsidiaries. Many of these plans are required by local regulatory requirements. We may deposit funds for these plans with insurance companies, third party trustees or into government-managed accounts consistent with local regulatory requirements, as applicable.\nThe total defined benefit plan pension expenses incurred for these plans were $0.5 million, $0.9 million, and $0.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our aggregate projected benefit obligation and aggregate net liability for defined benefit plans as of September 30, 2022 was $10.4 million and $4.9 million, as of September 30, 2021 was $14.7 million and $8.7 million, and as of September 30, 2020 was $8.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, charges for contributions to defined benefit pension plans were not material to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n15. Relationship with Parent and Related Entities\nIn connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into several agreements with Nuance that set forth the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off and that govern the relationship of the parties following the Spin-Off, including the following:\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement: We entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with Nuance in advance of the Distribution. The Separation and Distribution Agreement sets forth our agreements with Nuance regarding the principal actions to be taken in connection with the Spin-Off. It also sets forth other agreements that govern aspects of our relationship with Nuance following the Spin-Off.\nTax Matters Agreement: We entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Nuance that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Nuance and us after the Distribution with respect to all tax matters (including tax liabilities, tax attributes, tax returns and tax contests).\nTransition Services Agreement: We entered into a Transition Services Agreement pursuant to which Nuance will provide us, and we will provide Nuance, with certain specified services for a limited time to help ensure an orderly transition following the Distribution.\nEmployee Matters Agreement: We entered into an Employee Matters Agreement with Nuance that addresses employment and employee compensation and benefits matters. The Employee Matters Agreement addresses the allocation and treatment of assets and liabilities relating to employees and compensation and benefit plans and programs in which our employees participated prior to the Spin-Off.\nIntellectual Property Agreement: We entered into an Intellectual Property Agreement with Nuance, pursuant to which we granted to Nuance, and Nuance granted to us, perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free licenses to certain patents and technology, as well as certain other intellectual property that have historically been shared between us and Nuance.\nTransitional Trademark License Agreement: We entered into a Transitional Trademark License Agreement with Nuance, pursuant to which Nuance granted us a non-exclusive, royalty free license to continue using certain of Nuances trademarks, trade names and service marks with respect to the Nuance and Dragon brands in connection with the sale, marketing and other commercialization of our products and services.\nOEM and Distribution License Agreements: We entered into four OEM and Distribution License Agreements with Nuance. Under three of the four agreements, Cerence licenses to Nuance designated Cerence technologies for Nuances internal use and for distribution to Nuance end-users and resellers. Under the final agreement, Nuance licenses to Cerence designated Nuance technologies for Cerences internal use and for distribution to Cerence end-users and resellers. All agreements contain customary commercial terms for arrangements of this nature.\n16. Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\nThe components of (loss) income before income taxes are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nDomestic\n$\n(168,452\n)\n$\n20,933\n$\n(27,889\n)\nForeign\n(30,299\n)\n27,336\n4,849\n(Loss) income before income taxes\n$\n(198,751\n)\n$\n48,269\n$\n(23,040\n)\nThe components of provision for (benefit from) income taxes are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\nState\n-\nForeign\n14,761\n6,760\n5,844\nTotal current\n$\n14,788\n$\n6,795\n$\n5,844\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(6,823\n)\n5,437\n(1,636\n)\nState\n5,001\n(239\n)\nForeign\n103,892\n(14,857\n)\n(8,693\n)\nTotal deferred\n97,287\n(4,419\n)\n(10,568\n)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n112,075\n$\n2,376\n$\n(4,724\n)\nEffective income tax rate\n(56.4\n)%\n4.9\n%\n20.5\n%\nThe provision for (benefit from) income taxes differed from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory rate to our income (loss) before income taxes as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended September 30,\nFederal tax provision at statutory rate\n$\n(41,738\n)\n$\n10,137\n$\n(4,838\n)\nState tax, net of federal benefit\n3,979\n(221\n)\nForeign tax rate and other foreign related tax items\n(15,626\n)\n(2,347\n)\nUncertain tax positions\n(887\n)\nStock-based compensation\n(15,020\n)\n1,629\n3,456\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income\n(554\n)\nGoodwill impairment\n39,933\n-\n-\nChange in valuation allowance\n128,034\n(225\n)\n-\nNon-deductible expenditures\n1,095\n3,999\n2,728\nR&D credits\n(805\n)\n(2,932\n)\n(2,951\n)\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes\n$\n112,075\n$\n2,376\n$\n(4,724\n)\nThe effective income tax rate is based upon the income for the year, the composition of the income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, for the potential tax consequences, benefits or resolutions of audits or other tax contingencies. Our effective tax rate may be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nOur effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2022 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance in a foreign jurisdiction as discussed below, impairment of book goodwill, the tax impacts of stock-based compensation, and our composition of jurisdictional earnings.\nOur effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2021 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to our composition of jurisdictional earnings, U.S. inclusions of foreign taxable income as a result of changes in applicable tax laws in 2017, and an income tax benefit of $15.9 million related to an increase in the Netherlands tax rate enacted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nThe effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2020 differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0%, primarily due to our composition of jurisdictional earnings, R&D incentives, and an income tax benefit of approximately $5.0 million related to an increase in tax rates in the Netherlands enacted in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have not provided taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, which may be subject to foreign withholding taxes upon repatriation, as we consider these earnings indefinitely reinvested. Our indefinite reinvestment determination is based on the future operational and capital requirements of our domestic and foreign operations. We expect our international cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will continue to be used for our foreign operations and therefore do not anticipate repatriating these funds. As of September 30, 2022, it is not practical to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on these earnings due to the complexities of the utilization of foreign tax credits and other tax assets.\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) consist of the following as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n$\n44,131\n$\n17,098\nCapital loss carryforwards\n8,187\n8,187\nFederal credit carryforwards\n5,916\n5,160\nAccrued expenses and other reserves\n3,316\n5,992\nDifference in timing of revenue related items\n31,261\n39,105\nAcquired intangibles\n89,434\n102,481\nInterest limitations carryforward\n10,228\n7,319\nOperating lease liabilities\n4,874\n5,065\nDepreciation\n2,924\n2,723\nDeferred compensation\n1,910\n2,174\nPension obligation\n1,870\nOther\n3,078\n1,249\nTotal deferred tax assets\n$\n205,989\n$\n198,423\nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n(126,860\n)\n(12,209\n)\nDeferred tax assets\n$\n79,129\n$\n186,214\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation\n$\n(6,143\n)\n$\n(4,636\n)\nAcquired intangibles\n(14,570\n)\n(17,204\n)\nConvertible debt\n(2,463\n)\n(3,349\n)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n(4,189\n)\n(4,303\n)\nOther\n(749\n)\n(163\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(28,114\n)\n(29,655\n)\nNet deferred tax assets\n$\n51,015\n$\n156,559\nDeferred income taxes arise from temporary difference between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses. We regularly assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized, we consider all available positive and negative evidence. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we established a valuation allowance of $107.6 million against our deferred tax assets in the Netherlands, which consists of tax amortizable intellectual property and net operating loss carryforwards. We determined we had new negative evidence, based on updates to transfer pricing arrangements and changes to the earnings guidance for fiscal year 2022. We will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our Netherlands deferred tax assets until we believe it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. If sufficient positive evidence arises in the future indicating that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets meet the more likely than not standard, the valuation allowance would be reversed accordingly in the period that such determination is made.\nThe remaining deferred tax assets after valuation allowances are primarily domestic. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods for which these deferred tax assets are deductible, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of the domestic deductible differences.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have $8.2 million and $118.7 million in valuation allowance against our net domestic and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, we had $8.2 million and $4.0 million in valuation allowance against our net domestic and foreign deferred tax assets, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have U.S. federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $43.6 million, state NOL carryforwards of $11.9 million, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $184.9 million, before uncertain tax positions of $39.5 million. As\nof September 30, 2021, we have U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $15.0 million, state NOL carryforwards of $4.3 million, and foreign NOL carryforwards of $99.9 million, before uncertain tax position amounts of $32.8 million. These carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2026 and extending up to an unlimited period. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, unlimited federal NOLs are $42.8 million and $15.0 million, respectively, and unlimited Netherlands NOLs are $157.4 million and $70.1 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have U.S. federal research and development carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10.1 million, before uncertain tax positions of $8.1 million, state research and development credits of $0.2 million, and foreign research and development credits of $4.9 million. As of September 30, 2021, we have U.S. federal research and development carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $10.8 million, before uncertain tax positions of $9.1 million, state research and development credits of $0.3 million, and foreign research and development credits of $4.3 million. These carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in 2023 and extending up to 2041.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nASC 740 prescribes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements. We regularly assess the outcome of potential examinations in each of the taxing jurisdictions when determining the adequacy of the amount of unrecognized tax benefit recorded. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit which is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes line of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nBalance at the beginning of the year\n$\n87,144\n$\n67,358\nBeginning balance adjustment\n(13,181\n)\n9,884\nIncreases related to tax positions taken from prior periods\n2,277\n9,367\nIncreases related to tax positions taken during current period\n2,088\nDecreases for tax settlements and lapse in statutes\n(1,738\n)\n(233\n)\nBalance at the end of the year\n$\n76,590\n$\n87,144\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we finalized pre-spin tax attributes and recognized as beginning balance adjustments uncertain tax positions of $9.1 million on certain tax credit carryforwards. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, beginning balance adjustments include cumulative translation adjustments of ($13.2) million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nIncreases related to tax positions taken from prior period include the effect of tax rate changes of $2.3 million and $9.4 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022, $76.6 million of the unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate. We do not expect a significant change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. We recognized interest related to uncertain tax positions in our provision for (benefit from) income taxes of ($0.3) million, $0.3 million and ($0.1) million during fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 respectively. We recorded interest of $3.5 million and $4.2 million as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax, various state and local taxes and international income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. The 2016 through 2021 tax years remain open for all purposes of examination by the IRS and other taxing authorities in material jurisdictions.\n17.

The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were $169.8 million after deducting transaction costs. We used net proceeds from the\nissuance of the Notes to repay a portion of our indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, dated October 1, 2019, by and among us, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent (the Existing Facility).\nThe Notes are senior, unsecured obligations and will accrue interest payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2020, at a rate of 3.00% per year. The Notes will mature on June 1, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed, or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. As of September 30, 2022, the if-converted value of the Notes was $101.3 million less than its principal amount. As of September 30, 2021, the if-converted value of the Notes exceeded its principal amount by $274.4 million.\nA holder of Notes may convert all or any portion of its Notes at its option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on September 30, 2020 (and only during such fiscal quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the measurement period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if we call such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing.\nThe conversion rate will initially be 26.7271 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $37.42 per share of our common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its Notes called for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be.\nWe may not redeem the Notes prior to June 5, 2023. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes, at our option, on a redemption date occurring on or after June 5, 2023 and on or before the 31st scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes.\nIf we undergo a fundamental change, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe indenture governing the Notes contains customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may declare the entire principal amount of all the Notes plus accrued special interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable.\nAt issuance, we accounted for the Notes by allocating proceeds from the Notes into debt and equity components according to the accounting standards for convertible debt instruments that may be fully or partially settled in cash upon conversion. The initial carrying amount of the debt component, which approximates its fair value, was estimated by using an interest rate for nonconvertible debt, with terms similar to the Notes. The excess of the principal amount of the Notes over the fair value of the debt component was recorded as a debt discount and a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital. The debt discount is accreted to the carrying value of the Notes over their expected term as interest expense using the interest method. Upon issuance of the Notes, we recorded $155.3 million as debt and $19.7 million as additional paid-in capital in stockholders equity. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the carrying amount of the equity component, net of taxes and transaction costs was $14.4 million.\nWe incurred transaction costs of $5.6 million relating to the issuance of the Notes. In accounting for these costs, we allocated the costs of the offering between debt and equity in proportion to the fair value of the debt and equity recognized. The transaction costs allocated to the debt component of approximately $5.0 million were recorded as a direct deduction from the face amount of the\nNotes and are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Notes using the interest method. The transaction costs allocated to the equity component of approximately $0.6 million were recorded as a decrease in additional paid-in capital.\nThe interest expense recognized related to the Notes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nContractual interest expense\n$\n5,246\n$\n5,246\n$\n1,753\nAmortization of debt discount\n3,755\n3,527\n1,131\nAmortization of issuance costs\nTotal interest expense related to the Notes\n$\n9,945\n$\n9,660\n$\n3,169\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes was triggered during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, and the Notes were not convertible as of September 30, 2022, with no Notes being converted. Whether any of the Notes will be converted in future quarters will depend on the satisfaction of one or more of the conversion conditions in the future. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes at a time when any such Notes are convertible, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity.\nSenior Credit Facilities\nOn June 12, 2020 (the Financing Closing Date), in connection with our effort to refinance our existing indebtedness, we entered into a Credit Agreement, by and among the Borrower, the lenders and issuing banks party thereto and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the Credit Agreement), consisting of a four-year senior secured term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $125.0 million (the Term Loan Facility). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Term Loan Facility were $123.0 million, which together with proceeds from the Notes was intended to pay in full all indebtedness under the Existing Facility, and paid fees and expenses in connection with the Senior Credit Facilities. We also entered into a senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $50.0 million (the Revolving Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities), which shall be drawn on in the event that our working capital and other cash needs are not supported by our operating cash flow. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Facility.\nOur obligations under the Credit Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our existing and future direct and indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions customary for financings of this type. All obligations are secured by substantially all of our tangible and intangible personal property and material real property, including a perfected first-priority pledge of all (or, in the case of foreign subsidiaries or subsidiaries (FSHCO) that own no material assets other than equity interests in foreign subsidiaries that are controlled foreign corporations or other FSHCOs, 65%) of the equity securities of our subsidiaries held by any loan party, subject to certain customary exceptions and limitations.\nOn December 17, 2020 (the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date), we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment). The Amendment extended the scheduled maturity date of the revolving credit and term facilities from June 12, 2024 to April 1, 2025.\nThe Amendment revised certain interest rates in the Credit Agreement. Following delivery of a compliance certificate for the first full fiscal quarter after the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date, the applicable margins for the revolving credit and term facilities is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.75% or ABR plus 1.75%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.50% or ABR plus 1.50%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is LIBOR plus 2.20% or ABR plus 1.00%. As a result of the Amendment, the applicable LIBOR floor was reduced from 0.50% to 0.00%.\nFrom the Amendment No. 1 Effective Date until the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2020, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.50%. For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. For the three and twelve months ended September 30, 2022, the interest rate was LIBOR plus 2.25%. Total interest expense relating to the Senior Credit Facilities for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $4.3 million, $4.1 million, $1.5 million, respectively, reflecting the coupon and accretion of the discount.\nIn addition, the quarterly commitment fee required to be paid based on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the unused\nline fee is 0.500%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.450%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.400%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.350%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the unused line fee is 0.300%.\nThe Amendment revised the amount by which we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments. Through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2022, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 1.25% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility. From the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2023 and for each fiscal quarter thereafter, we are obligated to make quarterly principal payments in an aggregate amount equal to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loan Facility, with the balance payable at the maturity date thereof.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement are prepayable at our option without premium or penalty. We may request, and each lender may agree in its sole discretion, to extend the maturity date of all or a portion of the Senior Credit Facilities subject to certain conditions customary for financings of this type. The Credit Agreement also contains certain mandatory prepayment provisions in the event that we incur certain types of indebtedness or receives net cash proceeds from certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property, in each case subject to terms and conditions customary for financings of this type.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens, to dispose of assets, to make certain fundamental changes, to designate subsidiaries as unrestricted, to make certain investments, to prepay certain indebtedness and to pay dividends, or to make other distributions or redemptions/repurchases, in respect of our and our subsidiaries equity interests. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains financial covenants, each tested quarterly, (1) a net secured leveraged ratio of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00; (2) a net total leverage ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00; and (3) minimum liquidity of at least $75 million. The Credit Agreement also contains events of default customary for financings of this type, including certain customary change of control events. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we were in compliance with all Credit Agreement covenants.\nOn November 22, 2022 (the \"Amendment No. 2 Effective Date\"), we entered into Amendment No. 2 to the Credit Agreement (\"Amendment No. 2\"). Amendment No. 2 modified certain financial covenants between the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2023 to the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2023 (the \"covenant adjustment period\"). During the covenant adjustment period, each tested quarterly, we are required to maintain (1) a net secured leveraged ratio of not greater than 4.25 to 1.00; (2) minimum liquidity of at least $125 million; and (3) aggregate capital expenditures less than $7.5 million. The net total leverage ratio will be waived during the covenant adjustment period. At the conclusion of the covenant adjustment period, the original financial covenants will resume.\nAmendment No. 2 revised certain interest rates in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margins for the revolving credit and term facilities is subject to a pricing grid based upon the net total leverage ratio as follows (i) if the net total leverage ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%; (ii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.00 to 1.00 but greater than 2.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.75% or ABR plus 1.75%; (iii) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.50% or ABR plus 1.50%; (iv) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00 but greater than 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.25% or ABR plus 1.25%; and (v) if the net total leverage ratio is less than or equal to 1.50 to 1.00, the applicable margin is SOFR plus 2.20% or ABR plus 1.00%. From the Amendment No. 2 Effective Date until delivery of the first compliance certificate after the covenant adjustment period, the applicable margin will be SOFR plus 3.00% or ABR plus 2.00%. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNot Applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act required by Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b) or 15d-15(b), our principal executive officer (our Chief Executive Officer) and principal financial officer (our Chief Financial Officer) have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Cerence in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such reports is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement report on internal control over financial reporting. Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include those policies and procedures that:\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposals of the assets of the Company;\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements and all fraud. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the results of this assessment, management (including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer) has concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nThe attestation report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 issued by BDO USA, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, appears in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonability likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
