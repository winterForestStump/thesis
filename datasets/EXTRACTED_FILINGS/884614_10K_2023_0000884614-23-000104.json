    "content": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, many of which are not within our control, including the following risks relating to: (1) the demand for our products and services and our ability to grow our customer base; (2) our business operations, including internal and external factors that may impact our operational continuity; (3) our international operations; (4) our supply chain and our ability to obtain and transport adequate quantities of LPG; (5) government regulation and oversight; and (6) general factors that may impact our business and our shareholders. Investors should carefully consider, together with the other information contained in this Report, the risks and uncertainties described below. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, also may materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. No priority or significance is intended by, nor should be attached to, the order in which the risk factors appear.\nRisks Relating to the Demand for Our Products and Services and Our Ability to Grow Our Customer Base\nOur business is seasonal and decreases in the demand for our energy products and services because of warmer-than-normal heating season weather or unfavorable weather conditions may adversely affect our results of operations. Because many of our customers rely on our energy products and services to heat their homes and businesses our results of operations are adversely affected by warmer-than-normal heating season weather. Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our energy products and services for both heating and agricultural purposes. Accordingly, the volume of our energy products sold is at its highest during the peak heating season of October through March and is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather. For example, historically, approximately 60% to 70% of AmeriGas Propanes annual retail propane volume, 60% of UGI Internationals annual retail LPG volume, 55% to 65% of Energy Services retail natural gas volume and 60% of PA Gas Utilitys natural gas throughput (the total volume of gas sold to or transported for customers within our distribution system) has typically been sold during these months. There can be no assurance that normal winter weather in our market areas will occur in the future.\nIn addition, our agricultural customers use LPG for purposes other than heating, including for crop drying, and unfavorable weather conditions, such as lack of precipitation, may impact the demand for LPG. Moreover, harsh weather conditions may at times impede the transportation and delivery of LPG or restrict our ability to obtain LPG from suppliers. Spikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can stress the supply chain and limit our ability to obtain additional quantities of LPG. Changes in LPG supply costs are normally passed through to customers, but time lags (between when we purchase the LPG and when the customer purchases the LPG) may result in significant gross margin fluctuations that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe potential effects of climate change may affect our business, operations, supply chain and customers, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Shifts and fluctuations in weather patterns and other environmental conditions, including temperature and precipitation levels, may affect consumer demand for our energy products and services. In addition, the potential physical effects of climate change, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, fires and other climatic events, could disrupt our operations and supply chain, and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these effects. These or other meteorological changes could lead to increased operating costs, capital expenses or supply costs. Our commercial and residential customers may also experience the potential physical impacts of climate change and may incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to these efforts, including increasing the mix and resiliency of their energy solutions and supply, which may adversely impact their ability to pay for our products and services or decrease demand for our products and services. The impact of any one or all of the foregoing factors may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the direct physical impact that climate change may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we may also be adversely impacted by other environmental factors, including: (i) technological advances designed to promote energy efficiency and limit environmental impact; (ii) increased competition from alternative energy sources; (iii) regulatory responses aimed at decreasing GHG emissions; and (iv) litigation or regulatory actions that address the environmental impact of our energy products and services. For more information on these risks, please refer to the following risk factors included elsewhere in this section:\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as price induced customer conservation, may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services;\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources;\nOur need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results;\nOur operations, financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected by existing and future global climate change laws and regulations, including with respect to GHG emission restrictions, as well as market responses thereto; and\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance.\nOur potential to increase revenues may be affected by the decline in retail volumes of LPG and our ability to retain and grow our customer base. The retail LPG distribution industry in the U.S. and many of the European countries in which we operate is mature and has experienced either no or modest growth (or decline) the past few years, and we do not expect significant changes to total demand in the near future. Accordingly, we expect that year-to-year industry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our ability to grow within the LPG industry is dependent on our ability to acquire other retail distributors and to achieve internal growth, which includes the continuation of the ACE, Cynch and National Accounts programs in the U.S. and expansion in Europe, as well as the success of our sales and marketing programs designed to attract and retain customers. Any failure to retain and grow our customer base and successfully acquire other distributors would have an adverse impact on our results.\nOur ability to successfully execute on strategic initiatives and achieve our long-term goals may be adversely affected if we are not successful in identifying and completing strategic transactions and investments, or if we are unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such strategic transactions and investments. As part of our business strategy, we have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions, joint ventures, partnerships, divestitures, dispositions, and other strategic transactions and relationships with third parties. We have grown the Company through investments in the U.S. and in international markets, and have expanded our presence in the renewable energy industry. We may choose to finance any future investments with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. We can give no assurances that we will find attractive investment opportunities in the future (including renewable energy opportunities), that we will be able to complete and finance these transactions on economically acceptable terms, that any investments and related transactions will not be dilutive to earnings or that any additional debt incurred to finance such investment will not affect our ability to pay dividends. Moreover, certain investments and acquisitions in the U.S. and Europe may require merger control filings with the Federal Trade Commission and the European Commission, as applicable, and commitments (such as agreements not to compete for certain businesses) or divestments of assets may be required to obtain clearance. Such commitments or divestments may adversely influence the overall economics and risk profile of the contemplated transaction.\nTo the extent we are successful in executing these transactions, such transactions involve a number of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, the assumption of material liabilities, including environmental liabilities, the diversion of managements attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of acquired operations, difficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees and difficulties in the assimilation of different cultures and practices and internal controls, challenges with consolidating the operations of acquired companies into our own, as well as in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations. We also may experience integration difficulties, including in implementing new systems and processes and with integrating systems and processes of companies with complex operations, which can result in inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies and may increase the risk that our internal controls are found to be ineffective. Future investments could also result in, among other things, the failure to identify material issues during due diligence, the risk of overpaying for assets, unanticipated capital expenditures, the failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, recording goodwill and other intangible assets at values that ultimately may be subject to impairment charges and fluctuations in quarterly results. There can also be no assurance that our past and future investments, including our recent investments in renewable energy, will deliver the strategic, financial, operational and environmental benefits that we anticipate, nor can we be certain that strategic investments will remain available in the future.\nSimilarly, any divestitures or dispositions of assets have inherent risks, including the inability to find potential buyers upon favorable terms, expenses associated with a divestiture, the possibility that any anticipated sale will be delayed or will not occur, the potential impact on our cash flows and results of operations, the potential delay or failure to realize the perceived strategic or financial benefits of the divestment or disposition, difficulties in the separation of operations, services, information technology, products and personnel, potential loss of customers or employees, exposure to unanticipated liabilities, unexpected costs associated with such separation, diversion of managements attention from other business concerns and potential post-closing claims for alleged breaches of related agreements, indemnification or other disputes. Further, any cost saving measures, restructurings and divestitures may result in workforce reduction and consolidation of our facilities. As a result of these actions, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, disruptions to our operations and inefficiency during transitional periods. These actions could also impact employee retention. In addition, we cannot be sure that these actions will be as successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that we do not forego future business opportunities as a result of these actions.\nThe failure to successfully identify, complete, implement and manage business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures and investments intended to advance our business strategy could have an adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, our long-term goal to grow our earnings per share is driven by disciplined investments and is impacted by, among other things, our ability to increase investments in our regulated utilities businesses and generate significant fee-based income in our Midstream and Marketing operations. Other factors, assumptions and beliefs of management and our Board regarding external factors, including the global economy and regulatory developments, on which our long-term goals were based may also prove to differ materially from actual future results. Accordingly, we may not achieve our stated long-term goals, or our stated long-term goals may be negatively revised, as a result of less than expected progress toward achieving these goals.\nEnergy efficiency and technology advances, as well as price induced customer conservation, may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services. The trend toward increased energy efficiency and technological advances, including installation of improved insulation and the development of more efficient boilers and increased consumer preference for alternative heating equipment installations, such as electric heat pumps, alongside concerted conservation measures, which have been exacerbated particularly in Europe by the evolving energy crisis, may reduce the demand for our energy products. Prices for LPG and natural gas are subject to volatile fluctuations as a result of changes in supply and demand as well as other market conditions and external factors. During periods of high energy commodity costs, our prices generally increase, which may lead to customer conservation and attrition. A reduction in demand could lower our revenues and, therefore, lower our net income and adversely affect our cash flows. In addition, federal, European and/or local regulators may offer energy conservation incentives or otherwise enact laws and regulations that may require mandatory conservation measures, which would reduce the demand for our energy products. In Europe, measures are underway to decarbonize the electric generation grid, as well as residential and commercial heating, in order to achieve EU climate change objectives, including a net zero goal by 2050. For example, in 2018 the EU revised the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (the EPBD) with the goal to create a clear path towards a low and zero-emission and decarbonized building stock in the EU by 2050. Updates to the EPBD continue to make their way through EU legislative approvals, which will establish stronger targets for management of new and existing building construction and integral heating systems that focus on low or zero carbon outcomes. For example, certain EU countries have adopted legislation mandating the replacement of existing fossil-fuel based heating systems with lower carbon solutions and requiring newly installed heating systems to operate with renewable energy sources. Over time, these various measures will impact fossil fuel consumption in Europe and the demand for our energy products. We cannot predict the materiality of the effect of future conservation measures or the effect that any technological advances in heating, conservation, energy generation or other devices might have on our operations.\nOur operations may be adversely affected by competition from other energy sources. Our energy products and services face competition from other energy sources, some of which are less costly for equivalent energy value. In addition, we cannot predict the effect that the development of alternative energy sources might have on our operations.\nOur LPG distribution businesses compete for customers against suppliers of electricity, fuel oil and natural gas. Electricity is a major competitor of LPG but is generally more expensive than LPG on a Btu equivalent basis for space heating, water heating and cooking. However, in Europe and elsewhere, climate change policies favoring electricity from renewable energy sources or the use of electric-powered equipment, such as heat pumps in heating applications, may cause changes in current relative price relationships. Moreover, notwithstanding cost or regulatory mandates or incentives, the convenience and efficiency of electricity make it an attractive energy source for consumers and developers of new homes. Fuel oil, which is a major competitor to propane, is a less environmentally attractive energy source. Furnaces and appliances that burn LPG must be upgraded to run on fuel oil and vice versa, and, therefore, a conversion from one fuel to the other requires the installation of new equipment. Our customers generally have an incentive to switch to fuel oil only if fuel oil becomes significantly less expensive than LPG, and in multiple countries, the risk of conversion to fuel oil is diminishing due to regulations that prevent or disfavor the installation and/or use of fuel oil boilers or fuel oil for heating applications. The gradual expansion of natural gas distribution systems in our service areas may continue to result in the availability of natural gas in some areas that previously depended upon LPG resulting in lower demand for LPG.\nOur natural gas businesses in the U.S. compete primarily with electricity and fuel oil, and, to a lesser extent, with LPG and coal. Competition among these fuels is primarily a function of their comparative price and the relative cost and efficiency of fuel utilization equipment. There can be no assurance that our natural gas revenues will not be adversely affected by this competition.\nThe expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure assets subjects us to risks. We seek to grow our business through the expansion, construction and development of our energy infrastructure, including new pipelines, gathering systems, facilities and other assets. These projects are subject to state and federal regulatory oversight and require certain property rights, such as easements and rights-of-way from public and private owners, as well as regulatory approvals, including environmental and other permits and licenses. There is no assurance that we or our project partners, as applicable, will be able to obtain the necessary property rights, permits and licenses in a timely and cost-efficient manner, or at all, which may result in a delay or failure to complete a project. We may face opposition to the expansion, construction or development of new or existing pipelines, gathering systems, facilities or other assets from environmental groups, landowners, local groups and other advocates. This opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage our operations, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving our assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt, or delay the development or operation of our assets and business. Failure to complete any pending or future infrastructure project may have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if we are able to successfully complete any pending or future infrastructure project, our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project or as anticipated during the lifespan of the project. As a result, there is the risk that new and expanded energy infrastructure may not achieve our expected investment returns, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Operations, Including Internal and External Factors that May Impact Our Operational Continuity\nOur review of potential strategic alternatives may not result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or outcome, and the process of reviewing strategic alternatives or the outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operations and stock price. In August 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors initiated a process to evaluate potential strategic alternatives, including cost optimization initiatives, with the intent to unlock and maximize shareholder value. Our Board has not yet established a timeline for completion of the strategic review process, and there is no assurance that the process will result in the approval or completion of any specific transaction or outcome. We are actively working with financial and legal advisors in connection with our review of potential strategic alternatives.\nAny potential transaction or other strategic alternative would be dependent on a number of factors that may be beyond our control, including, among other things, market conditions, industry trends, regulatory approvals, and the availability of financing for a potential transaction on reasonable terms. The process of reviewing potential strategic alternatives, including optimization of our cost structure, is time consuming, may divert the attention of our Board and management from core business operations, and may be distracting and disruptive to our business operations and long-term planning, which may cause concern to our current or potential customers, employees, investors, strategic partners and other stakeholders, and may have a material impact on our business and operating results or our internal controls and procedures, or result in increased volatility in our share price. We may incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if consummated, will provide greater value to our shareholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Additionally, the outcome of the strategic review may adversely impact our business, cash flows, operations, financial condition and stock price. Until the review process is concluded or developments on the progress of the strategic review are disclosed, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, volatility in the market price of our common stock, and difficulty attracting and retaining qualified employees and business partners. Similarly, activist investors may engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board of Directors and management, which could negatively impact our business and operations and cause a distraction to our Board, management and employees.\nOur information technology systems and those of our third-party vendors have been the target of cybersecurity attacks in the past. If we are unable to protect our information technology systems against future service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security resulting from cybersecurity attacks or other events, or if we encounter other unforeseen difficulties in the design, implementation or operation of our information technology systems, or if our third-party vendors or service providers experience compromises to their information technology systems, our operations could be disrupted, our business and reputation may suffer, and our internal controls could be adversely affected. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the Internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. In addition, we rely on our information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements.\nCybersecurity incidents have recently increased in both frequency and magnitude and have involved malicious software and attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and systems, including ransomware attacks where a targets access to its information systems is blocked until a ransom has been paid. The White House and various regulators, including the SEC, have accordingly increased their focus on companies cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks. Despite our security measures, our technologies, systems, and networks have been and may continue to be the target of cybersecurity attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of our business operations. Due to increasingly sophisticated threat actors, we may be unable to detect, identify or prevent attacks, and even if detected, we may be unable to adequately stop, investigate or remediate our systems given the tools and techniques being used by threat actors to circumvent controls and to remove or obfuscate forensic evidence. Attacks and incidents may also occur due to malfeasance by employees or contractors, as well as human error as in the case of social engineering and phishing campaigns. A number of our employees currently work remotely full-time or on a hybrid basis; as a result, our cybersecurity program may be less effective and information technology security may be less robust for those employees. Similarly, our third-party vendors or service providers have been impacted by cybersecurity attacks and incidents and are subject to many, if not all, of the same risks and disruptions as described above. A loss of our information technology systems, or temporary interruptions in the operation of our information technology systems, or those of our third-party vendors or service providers, or any other misappropriation of data, or breaches of security could lead to investigations and fines or penalties, litigation, increased costs for compliance and for remediation or rebuilding of our systems, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation. In addition, an attack could provide an intruder with the ability to control or alter our pipeline operations. Such an act could result in critical pipeline failures.\nThe efficient execution of our businesses is dependent upon the proper design, implementation and functioning of its current and future internal systems, such as the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In addition, the effectiveness of our internal controls could be adversely affected if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to the operation of our information technology systems.\nMoreover, as cybersecurity incidents increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations, including the agreement to certain indemnification provisions by our insurance providers.\nOur utility transmission and distribution systems, our non-utility midstream assets, and the assets of upstream interstate pipelines and other midstream providers may not operate as planned, which may increase our expenses or decrease our revenues and, thus, have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our ability to manage operational risk with respect to utility distribution and transmission and non-utility midstream assets, and the availability of natural gas delivered by interstate natural gas pipelines and midstream gathering assets is critical to our financial results. We obtain our supply from local Marcellus and Utica Shale sources, as well as other trading points in the U.S. If we experience physical capacity constraints on one or more of the interstate or intrastate natural gas pipelines that supply our businesses, we may not be able to supply our customers, which could have an adverse impact on our financial results. Our businesses also face several risks, including the breakdown or failure of, or damage to, equipment or processes (especially due to severe weather or natural disasters), accidents and other factors, including as a result of overpressurization of or damage to natural gas pipelines. Operation of our transmission and distribution systems or our midstream assets below our expectations may result in lost revenues or increased expenses, including higher maintenance costs, civil litigation and the risk of regulatory penalties.\nRisks Relating to Our International Operations\nOur international operations could be subject to increased risks, which may negatively affect our business results. We operate LPG distribution and energy marketing businesses in Europe through our subsidiaries. As a result, we face risks in conducting business abroad that we do not face domestically. Certain aspects inherent in transacting business internationally could negatively impact our operating results, including:\ncosts and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\ndisagreements and disputes with our employees represented by a works council or union;\nstrikes and work stoppages by the employees of the Company or our suppliers and vendors;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, which can affect demand for our products, increase our costs and adversely affect our profitability and reported results;\nnew or revised regulatory requirements, including European competition and carbon emission reduction laws, that may adversely affect the terms of contracts with customers, including with respect to exclusive supply rights and usage restrictions, and stricter regulations applicable to the storage and handling of LPG;\nnew and inconsistently enforced industry regulatory requirements, which can have an adverse effect on our\ncompetitive position;\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\ndifficulties in enforcing contractual rights;\nlocal political and economic conditions as well as geopolitical conditions that could cause instability and adversely impact the global economy or specific markets, such as the war between Russia and Ukraine; and\npotential violations of federal regulatory requirements, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering law, economic sanctions, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, and EU regulatory requirements, including the GDPR and Sapin II.\nIn particular, certain legal and regulatory risks are associated with international business operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption, economic sanctions and trade compliance laws, rules and regulations. For example, the U.S. government imposes restrictions and prohibitions on transactions in certain foreign countries, including restrictions directed at oil and gas activities in Russia. U.S. laws also prohibit the improper offer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of money or anything of value to any foreign official or political party, or to any person, knowing that all or a portion of it will be used to influence a foreign official in his or her official duties or to secure an improper advantage. Ensuring compliance with all relevant laws, rules and regulations is a complex task. Violation of one or more of these laws, rules or regulations could lead to loss of import or export privileges, civil or criminal penalties for us or our employees, or potential reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on earnings, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe European energy crisis may create LPG commodity supply challenges and could negatively impact our business results. The geopolitical situation in Europe during 2022 led to a sharp decrease in natural gas imports from Russia to Europe. This decrease resulted in a significant increase in natural gas prices in Europe. Although the natural gas prices have declined from the unprecedented highs of 2022, in response to the significant price increases experienced, refineries still see an incentive to, and are substituting a portion of their natural gas refinery fuels with, LPG leading to a decrease in the availability of inland LPG as well as higher LPG costs. In addition, gas processing plants supplying the United Kingdom and Norway markets are injecting LPG into the natural gas grid, decreasing the overall supply of LPG from the gas processing plants. In this context, LPG supply patterns are substantially changing with increased reliance on sea-imports and land logistics.\nWe anticipate that the European energy crisis and the corresponding response by refineries and gas processing plants will continue in Fiscal 2024, leading to continued commodity supply challenges in some markets, higher commodity costs that may not be able to be absorbed by our customers, particularly in the Nordic countries and our Eastern European markets, and lower consumption by our customers, among other impacts, which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flows and overall financial condition.\nEconomic and geopolitical instability, including as a result of acts of war, have had, and could continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows. In late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, which has continued through the date of this Report. We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, the outbreak of war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by U.S. and European governments, together with any additional future sanctions by them, could have a larger impact that expands into other geographies where we do business, including our supply chain, business partners and customers in those markets, which could result in lost sales, supply shortages, commodity price fluctuations, increased costs, transportation logistics challenges, customer credit and liquidity issues, and lost efficiencies. The acceleration of a global energy crisis, including as a result of restrictions on Russias energy exports, could similarly impact the geographies where we do business. In addition, the U.S. and Europe have commenced certain trade actions as a result of the war between Russia and Ukraine. While significant uncertainty exists with respect to this matter, the war between Russia and Ukraine and its broader impacts, including any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade imposed by the U.S. or Europe, or further trade measures taken by Russia or other countries in response, could have a material impact on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur energy marketing business in Europe may continue to be disrupted by extreme prices and volatility in the natural gas and power markets in Europe, which have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a material negative impact on our financial results. Our natural gas and power marketing businesses have traditionally relied upon relative pricing and periods of market stability. Since the end of 2021, the European energy markets have been in an unprecedented state of volatility. The war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting substantial reduction of natural gas imports from Russia to Europe have led to significant uncertainty in supply, including price volatility of both wholesale gas and power, and have created new risks that we have experienced and expect to continue to experience within our European energy marketing business. These risks include: (i) the ability to economically support the traditional fixed price and full requirement contracts of customers due to the significant increased cost to adjust for shifting volumes due to excess or shortage of consumption expectations; (ii) the ability to service typical portfolio needs with standard trading activities due to the limitations on purchasing cost effective services in the market; (iii) the ability to pass increased and volume deviation costs, including balancing costs, onto customers due, among other\nthings, to timing, regulatory and contractual constraints, (iv) the ability to maintain sourcing services to customers due to the margining and liquidity constraints as well as maximum trading limits implemented by both clearing banks and wholesale counterparties on energy suppliers, and (v) the ability to economically support fixed and variable price products while offering competitive services in the market. As a result, UGI considered all scenarios with respect to the future of its energy marketing business in Europe and decided to exit this market. UGI sold its energy marketing businesses in the United Kingdom, France and Belgium and UGI continues to make progress on the wind-down of its energy marketing business in the Netherlands. The risks identified with respect to our energy marketing business in Europe have resulted in and may continue to have a material negative impact on our financial results.\nRisks Relating to Our Supply Chain and Our Ability to Obtain Adequate Quantities of LPG\nWe are dependent on our principal LPG suppliers, which increases the risks from an interruption in supply and transportation. During Fiscal 2023, AmeriGas Propane purchased approximately 85% of its propane needs from 20 suppliers. If supplies from these sources were interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and, at least on a short-term basis, our earnings could be affected. Additionally, in certain geographic areas, a single supplier provides more than 50% of AmeriGas Propanes propane requirements. Disruptions in supply in these geographic areas could also have an adverse impact on our earnings. Our international businesses are similarly dependent upon their LPG suppliers. For example, during Fiscal 2023, UGI Internationals business in the United Kingdom purchased approximately 76% of its LPG needs from two suppliers and, in Italy, approximately 72% of its supply was sourced from two suppliers. If supplies from UGI Internationals principal LPG sources are interrupted, the cost of procuring replacement supplies and transporting those supplies from alternative locations might be materially higher and our earnings could be adversely affected. There is no assurance that our international businesses will be able to continue to acquire sufficient supplies of LPG to meet demand at prices or within time periods that would allow them to remain competitive.\nOur ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG is dependent on transportation facilities and providers. Spikes in demand caused by weather or other factors can limit our access to port terminals and other transportation and storage facilities, disrupt transportation and limit our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of LPG. A significant increase in port and similar fees and fuel prices may also adversely affect our transportation costs and business. Transportation providers (rail and truck) in some circumstances have limited ability to provide additional resources in times of peak demand. Moreover, the ability of our transportation providers to maintain a staff of qualified truck drivers is critical to the success of our business. Regulatory requirements and an improvement in the economy could reduce the number of eligible drivers or require us to pay higher transportation fees as our transportation providers seek to pass on additional labor costs associated with attracting and retaining drivers.\nOur profitability is subject to LPG pricing and inventory risk. The retail LPG business is a margin-based business in which gross profits are dependent upon the excess of the sales price over LPG supply costs. LPG is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control over supplies, commodity prices or market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the LPG that our subsidiaries and other distributors and marketers purchase can change rapidly over a short period of time. Most of our domestic LPG product supply contracts permit suppliers to charge posted prices at the time of delivery or negotiated prices based on the current industry index prices established at major U.S. storage points such as Mont Belvieu, Texas or Conway, Kansas. Most of our international LPG supply contracts are based on internationally quoted market prices. We also purchase a portion of our supplies in the spot market. Because our subsidiaries profitability is sensitive to changes in wholesale LPG supply costs, we will be adversely affected if we cannot pass on increases in the cost of LPG to our customers, or if there is a delay in passing on such cost increases. Due to competitive pricing in the industry, our subsidiaries may not fully be able to pass on product cost increases to our customers when product costs rise, or when our competitors do not raise their product prices in a timely manner. Finally, market volatility may cause our subsidiaries to sell LPG at less than the price at which they purchased it, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe offer our customers various fixed-price LPG programs, and a significant number of our customers utilize our fixed-price programs. In order to manage the price risk from offering these services, we utilize our physical inventory position, supplemented by forward commodity transactions with various third parties having terms and volumes substantially the same as our customers contracts, but there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. In periods of high LPG price volatility, the fixed-price programs create exposure to over or under-supply positions as the demand from customers may significantly exceed or fall short of supply procured. In addition, if LPG prices decline significantly subsequent to customers signing up for a fixed-price program, there is a risk that customers will default on their commitments, adversely affecting our results of operations.\nChanges in commodity market prices may have a significant negative effect on our liquidity. Depending on the terms of our contracts with suppliers as well as our use of financial instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of LPG and natural gas, changes in the market price of LPG and natural gas can create margin payment obligations for us and expose us to increased liquidity risk. In addition, increased demand for domestically produced LPG and natural gas overseas may, depending on production volumes in the U.S., result in higher domestic prices and expose us to additional liquidity risks.\nSupplier and derivative counterparty defaults may have a negative effect on our operating results. When we enter into fixed-price sales contracts with customers, we typically enter into fixed-price purchase contracts with suppliers. Depending on changes in the market prices of products compared to the prices secured in our contracts with suppliers of LPG, natural gas and electricity, a default of or force majeure by one or more of our suppliers under such contracts could cause us to purchase those commodities at higher prices from alternate suppliers, which would have a negative impact on our operating results.\nAdditionally, we economically hedge the market risk associated with a substantial portion of our supply purchases using certain derivative instruments. Such changes in market prices of the aforementioned commodities could result in material exposures or significant concentrations of balances with derivative counterparties. If certain counterparties were unable to meet the obligations set forth in these derivative contracts and we were unable to fully mitigate this exposure via collateral deposit requirements and master netting arrangements, such outcomes could result in a negative effect on our operating results.\nOur business is dependent on the domestic and global supply chain to ensure that equipment, materials and other resources are available to both expand and maintain services in a safe and reliable manner. Moreover, prices of equipment, materials and other resources have increased recently and may continue to increase in the future. Failure to secure equipment, materials and other resources on economically acceptable terms may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Current domestic and global supply chain issues are delaying the delivery, and in some cases resulting in shortages of, materials, equipment and other resources that are critical to our business operations. Failure to eliminate or manage the constraints in the supply chain may impact the availability of items that are necessary to support normal operations as well as materials that are required for continued infrastructure growth, including the replacement of end-of-life assets.\nMoreover, inflation has been and continues to be an area of increasing economic concern, both domestically and internationally. Changes in the costs of providing our energy products and services, including price increases in equipment and materials as well as increases in labor and distribution costs, have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our financial condition and results of operations and/or result in corresponding price increases for the energy products and services we offer our customers.\nRisks Relating to Government Regulation and Oversight\nRegulators may not approve the rates we request and existing rates may be challenged, which may adversely affect our results of operations. In our Utilities segment, our distribution operations are subject to regulation by the PAPUC, WVPSC and MDPSC, depending on the state in which the operations are located. These regulatory bodies, among other things, approve the rates that Utilities may charge utility customers, thus impacting the returns that Utilities may earn on the assets that are dedicated to its operations. Utilities periodically files, and we expect to continue to periodically file, requests with these regulatory bodies to increase base rates charged to customers in the respective states in which Utilities operates. If Utilities is required in a rate proceeding to reduce the rates it charges its utility customers, or is unable to obtain approval for timely rate increases from the appropriate regulatory body, particularly when necessary to cover increased costs, Utilities revenue growth will be limited and earnings may decrease.\nThe enactment of proposed or future tax legislation may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. We continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal, state, local and international legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal, state, local and/or international taxes. We cannot predict what impact, if any, changes in federal policy, including tax policies, will have on our industry or whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing our cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Changes in applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our tax expense and profitability. Such impact may also be affected positively or negatively by subsequent potential judicial interpretation or related regulation or legislation which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nOur need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results. While we\ngenerally refer to our Utilities segment as our regulated segment, there are many governmental regulations that have an impact on all of our businesses. Currently, we are subject to extensive and changing international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, safety, health, transportation, tax, and environmental laws and regulations that govern the marketing, storage, distribution, and transportation of our energy products. Moreover, existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us that may affect our businesses in ways that we cannot predict.\nNew regulations, or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations, could result in increased expenditures. In addition, for many of our operations, we are required to obtain permits from regulatory authorities and, in some cases, such regulatory permits could subject our operations to additional regulations and standards of conduct. Failure to obtain or comply with these permits or applicable regulations and standards of conduct could result in civil and criminal fines or the cessation of the operations in violation. Governmental regulations and policies in the U.S. and Europe may provide for subsidies or incentives to customers who use alternative fuels instead of carbon fuels. The EU has committed to cut CO2 emissions and EU member states are proposing and implementing a range of subsidies and incentives to achieve the EUs climate change goals. These subsidies and incentives may result in reduced demand for our energy products and services.\nWe are investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating sites in the U.S., including former sites where we or our former subsidiaries operated MGPs. We have also received claims from third parties that allege that we are responsible for costs to clean up properties where we or our former subsidiaries operated a MGP or conducted other operations. Most of the costs we incur to remediate sites outside of Pennsylvania cannot currently be recovered in PAPUC rate proceedings, and insurance may not cover all or even part of these costs. Our actual costs to clean up these sites may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as:\nthe discovery of presently unknown conditions;\nchanges in environmental laws and regulations;\njudicial rejection of our legal defenses to third-party claims; or\nthe insolvency of other responsible parties at the sites at which we are involved.\nMoreover, if we discover additional contaminated sites, we could be required to incur material costs, which would reduce our net income.\nWe also may be unable to timely respond to changes within the energy and utility sectors that may result from regulatory initiatives to further increase competition within our industry. Such regulatory initiatives may create opportunities for additional competitors to grow their business or enter our markets and, as a result, we may be unable to maintain our revenues or continue to pursue our current business strategy.\nOur operations, financial results and cash flows may be adversely affected by existing and future global climate change laws and regulations, including with respect to GHG emission restrictions, as well as market responses thereto. Climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made, and could continue to be made, at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor and limit GHG emissions and climate impact. These efforts have included consideration of, among other things, cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nIncreased regulation of GHG emissions, or climate impact generally, could have significant additional adverse impacts on us as well as our suppliers, vendors, and customers. The adoption and implementation of any laws or regulations imposing obligations on, or limiting GHG emissions from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur significant costs to reduce GHG emissions associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for our energy products. The potential increase in our operating costs could include, but are not limited to, new costs to operate and maintain our facilities, install new emission controls on our facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our GHG emissions, administer and manage a GHG emissions reduction program, and adversely impact the value of certain assets. We may not be able to pass on resulting increases in costs to customers. In addition, changes in regulatory policies that result in a reduction in the demand for hydrocarbon products and carbon-emitting fuel sources that are deemed to contribute to climate change, or restrict the use of such products or fuel sources, may reduce volumes available to us for processing, transportation, marketing and storage and could cause increases in costs or production disruptions. These developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial results, valuation and useful life of assets, and cash flows.\nChanges in data privacy and data protection laws and regulations or any failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business and financial results. As part of our operations, we collect, use, store and transfer the personal information and data of our employees as well as customer, vendor and supplier data in and across various jurisdictions. There has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfers, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The laws in these areas continue to develop and the changing nature of data protection, information security and privacy laws in the U.S., the EU and elsewhere could impact our processing of the personal information and data of our employees, vendors, suppliers and customers, which could lead to increased operating costs. Existing and emerging laws and regulations are inconsistent across jurisdictions and are subject to evolving, differing, and sometimes conflicting interpretations. The EU adopted the GDPR, which expanded EU data protections, in certain circumstances, to companies outside of the EU processing data of EU residents, regardless of whether the processing occurs in the EU. Similarly, the State of California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (the CPRA), which, among other things, grant a number of rights to California residents with respect to their personal information, and require companies to make extensive disclosures to consumers about such companies data collection, use, and sharing practices and inform consumers of their personal information rights. In addition, the CPRA created a new state privacy regulator, which will likely result in greater regulatory activity and enforcement in the privacy area. Comprehensive privacy laws with some similarities to the CCPA and CPRA have been proposed or passed at the U.S. federal and state levels, such as the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (the VCDPA) and the Colorado Privacy Act (the CPA). Additionally, the Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data as well as requiring disclosures about these practices. We expect that there will continue to be new laws, regulations and industry standards concerning data privacy and data protection, including artificial intelligence, in the U.S., the EU and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact such laws, regulations, interpretations and standards may have on our business.\nWhile we have invested significant time and resources in our GDPR and U.S. privacy law compliance program, emerging and changing data privacy and data protection requirements as well as other new and upcoming European and U.S. federal and state privacy and cybersecurity laws and industry standards may cause us to incur substantial fines, additional significant costs or require us to change our business practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply may result in proceedings or actions against us by government entities or individuals, including class actions. Moreover, any inquiries or investigations, any other government actions or any actions by individuals may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines, demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\nThe provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), related regulations, and the rules adopted thereunder and other regulations, including the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (the EMIR), may have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to hedge risks associated with our business. Our derivative hedging activities are subject to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, which regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC and the federal banking regulators to implement the Dodd-Frank Acts provisions through rulemaking, including rules regarding mandatory clearing, trade execution and margin requirements. We have and expect to continue to qualify for and rely upon an exception from mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for swaps entered into by commercial end-users to hedge commercial risks. In addition to relief from the clearing mandate, we also expect to continue to qualify for an exception for non-financial end-users from the margin requirements on uncleared swaps. If we are not able to do so and have to post margin supporting our uncleared swaps in the future, our costs of entering into and maintaining swaps would be increased.\nBased on information available as of the date of this Report, the effect of such requirements will be likely to (directly or indirectly) increase our overall costs of entering into derivatives transactions. In particular, new margin requirements, position limits and significantly higher capital charges resulting from new global capital regulations, even if not directly applicable to us, may cause an increase in the pricing of derivatives transactions entered into by market participants to whom such requirements apply or affect our overall ability to enter into derivatives transactions with certain counterparties. While costs imposed directly on us due to regulatory requirements for derivatives under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as reporting, recordkeeping and electing the end-user exception from mandatory clearing, are relatively minor, costs imposed upon our counterparties may increase the cost of our doing business in the derivatives markets to the extent such costs are passed on to us.\nThe EMIR may result in increased costs for over-the-counter derivative counterparties trading in the EU and may also lead to an increase in the costs of, and demand for, the liquid collateral that the EMIR requires central counterparties to accept. Although we expect to continue to qualify as a non-financial counterparty under the EMIR, and thus not be required to post margin, we are currently subject to limited derivatives reporting requirements that could expand in the future, and may also be\nsubject to increased regulatory requirements, including recordkeeping, marking to market, timely confirmations, portfolio reconciliation and dispute resolution procedures. Provisions under the EMIR could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts, materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts and reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter. The increased trading costs and collateral costs may have an adverse impact on our business, contracts, financial condition, operating results, cash flow, liquidity and prospects.\nGeneral Risks that May Impact Our Business and Our Shareholders\nThe inability to attract, develop, retain and engage key employees could adversely affect our ability to execute our strategic, operational and financial plans. We are dependent upon the continued service and contributions of our management and key technical and professional employees, as well as our ability to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our employees retire or we otherwise experience employee turnover. In addition, the success of our operations depends on our ability to identify, attract and develop skilled and experienced key employees. There is increased competition for experienced management and technical and professional employees, which could increase the costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such individuals. We may not be able to attract, retain or engage key employees if our compensation and benefits program is not as robust as the compensation and benefits programs offered by other employers for similar roles. Further, a lack of employee engagement could lead to loss of productivity and increased employee burnout, turnover, absenteeism, safety incidents as well as decreased customer satisfaction. Additionally, uncertainty as a result of our ongoing review of strategic alternatives could negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain key employees. If we cannot identify, attract, develop, retain and engage management, technical and professional employees, along with other qualified employees, to support the various functions of our business, our operations and financial performance could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to collect on the accounts of our customers. We depend on the viability of our customers for collections of accounts receivable and notes receivable. Moreover, our businesses serve numerous retail customers, and as we grow our businesses organically and through acquisitions, our retail customer base is expected to expand. There can be no assurance that our customers will not experience financial difficulties in the future or that we will be able to collect all of our outstanding accounts receivable or notes receivable. Any such nonpayment by our customers could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be covered by insurance. Our business operations are subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to the handling, storage and distribution of combustible products, such as LPG and natural gas, and the generation of electricity. These risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, and severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment arising from explosions and other catastrophic events, including acts of terrorism. As a result of these and other incidents, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, including regulatory investigations, claims, lawsuits and other proceedings. Additionally, environmental contamination or other incidents resulting in an environmental impact have resulted in, and could continue to result in, legal or regulatory proceedings (see Our need to comply with, and respond to, industry-wide changes resulting from, comprehensive, complex, and sometimes unpredictable governmental regulations, including regulatory initiatives aimed at increasing competition within our industry, may increase our costs and limit our revenue growth, which may adversely affect our operating results for more information on such proceedings). There can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to pending and future claims or that such levels of insurance would be available in the future at economical prices. Moreover, defense and settlement costs may be substantial, even with respect to claims and investigations that have no merit. If we cannot resolve these matters favorably, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects may be materially adversely affected.\nThe risk of natural disasters, pandemics and catastrophic events, including acts of war and terrorism, may adversely affect the economy and the price and availability of LPG, other refined fuels and natural gas. Natural disasters, pandemics and catastrophic events, such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, terrorist attacks, war (including conflict in the Middle East), political unrest and other similar occurrences, may adversely impact the demand for, price and availability of LPG (including propane), other refined fuels and natural gas, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoing may have on our industries in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. A natural disaster, pandemic or an act of war or terrorism could result in disruptions of crude oil or natural gas supplies and markets (the sources of LPG), cause price volatility in the cost of LPG, fuel oil and natural gas, and our infrastructure facilities could be directly or indirectly impacted. Additionally, if our means of supply transportation, such as rail, truck or pipeline, are delayed or temporarily unavailable due to a natural disaster, pandemic, war or terrorist activity, we may be unable to transport LPG and other refined fuels in a timely manner or at all. A lower level of economic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result of a natural disaster, pandemic, war or terrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. We have opted to purchase insurance coverage for natural disasters and terrorist acts within our property and casualty insurance programs, but we can give no assurance that our insurance\ncoverage would be adequate to fully compensate us for any losses to our business or property resulting from natural disasters or terrorist acts.\nOur indebtedness may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our debt agreements also contain covenants that restrict our operational flexibility. As of September 30, 2023, we had total indebtedness of approximately $7 billion. Our indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and operational flexibility by, among other things:\nimpairing our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes\u037e\nlimiting operational flexibility and our ability to pursue business opportunities and implement certain business strategies;\nimpairing our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions;\nimpairing our ability to repay our indebtedness at maturity, especially where our debt agreements contain significant maturities;\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates where our debt agreements have variable interest rates; and\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have proportionately less debt and fewer guarantee obligations.\nThe occurrence of any of such events could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, if our credit ratings were to be downgraded, or general market conditions were to ascribe higher risk to our rating levels, our industry, or us, our access to capital and the cost of any future debt financing could be negatively impacted. Additionally, our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, seasonal cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, we may be required to, among other things, refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness, and any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on favorable terms or at all.\nIn addition, our debt agreements generally contain customary affirmative covenants, including, among others, covenants pertaining to the delivery of financial statements; certain financial covenants; notices of default and certain other material events; payment of obligations; preservation of corporate existence, rights, privileges, permits, licenses, franchises and intellectual property; maintenance of property and insurance and compliance with laws, as well as customary negative covenants, including, among others, limitations on the incurrence of liens, investments and indebtedness; mergers, acquisitions and certain other fundamental changes; transfers, leases or dispositions of assets outside the ordinary course of business\u037e restricted payments; changes in our line of business\u037e transactions with affiliates and burdensome agreements. These covenants could affect our ability to operate our business, respond to changes in business and economic conditions, obtain additional financing (if needed), and may increase the amount of interest expense we ultimately pay pursuant to the debt agreements. Further, our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or regulatory changes. A failure to comply with the covenants in our debt agreements could result in a default or an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, foreclose against any assets securing the debt under our debt agreements and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds available to pay down the indebtedness (together with accrued interest and fees), or that we will have the ability to refinance the accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all. This could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the terms of future debt agreements could include more restrictive covenants, or require incremental collateral, which may further restrict our business operations or conflict with covenant restrictions then in effect. As a result, there is no guarantee that financings will be available in the future to fund our obligations, or that they will be available on terms consistent with our expectations. See the liquidity section in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information on our current debt agreements.\nAn impairment of our assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We test goodwill, intangible, and other long-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. To the extent the value of goodwill or long-lived assets becomes impaired, the Company may be required to incur impairment charges that could have a material impact on our results of operations. The testing of assets for impairment requires us to make significant estimates about our future events, including our performance and projected cash flows, as well as other assumptions. These estimates can be affected by numerous factors, including developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, developments in regulatory, industry and market conditions, changes in business operations, changes in competition or changes in technologies. Any changes in key assumptions, or actual performance compared with key assumptions, about our business and its future prospects could affect the fair value of one or more of our assets, which may result in an impairment charge. We have incurred and may continue to incur impairment charges on certain of our assets that could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nOur holding company structure could limit our ability to pay dividends or service debt. We are a holding company whose material assets are the stock of our subsidiaries. Our ability to pay dividends on our Common Stock and to pay principal and accrued interest on our debt, if any, depends on the payment of dividends to us by our principal subsidiaries. Payments to us by our subsidiaries, in turn, depend upon their consolidated results of operations and cash flows. The operations of our subsidiaries are affected by conditions beyond our control, including weather, regulations, competition in national and international markets we serve, the costs and availability of propane, butane, natural gas, electricity, and other energy sources, capital market conditions and interest rates and other business risks impacting liquidity levels. The ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us is also affected by the level of indebtedness of our subsidiaries, which is substantial, and the restrictions on payments to us imposed under the terms of such indebtedness.\nVolatility in credit and capital markets may restrict our ability to grow, increase the likelihood of defaults by our suppliers and vendors, customers and counterparties and adversely affect our operating results. Volatility in credit and capital markets may create additional risks to our businesses in the future. We are exposed to financial market risk (including refinancing risk) resulting from factors beyond our control, including, among other things, commodity price volatility and changes in interest rates and conditions in the credit and capital markets. Adverse developments in the credit markets may increase our possible exposure to the liquidity, default and credit risks of our suppliers and vendors, counterparties associated with derivative financial instruments and our customers.\nWe depend on our intellectual property and failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect us. We seek trademark protection for our brands in each of our businesses, and we invest significant resources in developing our business brands. Failure to maintain our trademarks and brands could adversely affect our customer-facing businesses and our operational results.\nDeclines in the stock market or bond market, and a low interest rate environment, may negatively impact our pension liability. Declines in the stock market and a low interest rate environment historically have resulted in a significant impact on our pension liability and funded status. Declines in the stock or bond market and valuation of stocks or bonds, combined with low interest rates, could further impact our pension liability and funded status and increase the amount of required contributions to our pension plans.\nUnless we otherwise consent in writing, our Amended and Restated Bylaws designate a state court located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or, if no state court located within such county has jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could discourage lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide that, unless we otherwise consent in writing, a state court located in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania or, if no state court located within such county has jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, the federal United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (b) any action or proceeding asserting a claim of breach of duty owed to us or our shareholders by any director, officer, or other employee of ours; (c) any action or proceeding asserting a claim against us or against any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to, or involving any interpretation or enforcement of, any provision of the Pennsylvania Associations Code, Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law of 1988, or our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation or Amended and Restated Bylaws; and (d) any action or proceeding asserting a claim peculiar to the relationship between or among us and our officers, directors, and shareholders, or otherwise governed by or involving the internal affairs doctrine. This exclusive forum provision does not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the Securities Act.\nThis exclusive forum provision may limit the ability of our shareholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such shareholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. Alternatively, if a court outside of Pennsylvania were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.  ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWith the exception of those matters set forth in Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 15 of this Report, no material legal proceedings are pending involving the Company, any of its subsidiaries, or any of their properties, and no such proceedings are known to be contemplated by governmental authorities other than claims arising in the ordinary course of business. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNone.\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nInformation regarding our executive officers is included in Part III of this Report and is incorporated in Part I by reference.\nPART II: ITEM 5.MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information and Dividend Policy\nOur Common Stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UGI. On November 10, 2023, we had 6,313 holders of record of Common Stock.\nPayment of dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors. Factors considered in determining dividends include our profitability and expected capital needs. Subject to these qualifications, we presently expect to continue to pay dividends on a quarterly basis.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nInformation regarding the securities authorized for issuance under our equity compensation plans can be found under Part III of this Report.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Company did not repurchase any shares of its Common Stock during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had 6.50 million shares of Common Stock available for repurchase through an extension of a previous share repurchase program announced by the Company on February 2, 2022. The Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 8 million shares of Common Stock over a four-year period expiring in February 2026.\nRecent Sale of Unregistered Securities\nThe Company did not sell any unregistered securities during Fiscal 2023.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the cumulative five-year total shareholder return (stock price appreciation and the reinvestment of dividends) on an investment of $100 in UGI Common Stock, the S&P 500 Index, and the S&P 500 Utilities Index over the five years from September 30, 2018, through September 30, 2023. The stock performance shown on the graph below is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of future stock price performance. ITEM 6.SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nIntentionally omitted. ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMD&A discusses our results of operations for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, and our financial condition. For discussion of our results of operations and cash flows for Fiscal 2022 compared with Fiscal 2021, refer to Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 21, 2022. MD&A should be read in conjunction with Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties, Item 1A, Risk Factors, and the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 below including Segment Information included in Note 22 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBecause most of our businesses sell or distribute energy products used in large part for heating purposes, our results are significantly influenced by temperatures in our service territories, particularly during the heating-season months of October through March. Accordingly, our results of operations, after adjusting for the effects of gains and losses on derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions as further discussed below, are significantly higher in our first and second fiscal quarters.\nExecutive Overview\nRecent Developments\nReview of Strategic Alternatives. In August 2023, the Company announced the commencement of a strategic review, focused on the LPG businesses, intending to unlock and maximize shareholder value. The Company is exploring a full range of options with the goal of reducing UGIs earnings volatility and strengthening our balance sheet. In conjunction with the strategic review, the Company is also pursuing actions to optimize its cost structure and re-align its capital allocation priorities. The Company expects to continue on its existing plans while the review of strategic alternatives is ongoing.\nImpairment of Goodwill. During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company identified interim impairment indicators related to goodwill within the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit: (1) AmeriGas Partners issued $500 million of Senior Notes at an interest rate of 9.375%, which was significantly higher than the interest rates on the other AmeriGas Propane debt obligations; and (2) financial projections for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit were reduced significantly compared to previous forecasts following declines in gross margins and customer retention and higher operating expenses. The Company concluded that these events constituted triggering events that indicate that the AmeriGas Propane goodwill may be impaired and, as such, performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill as of May 31, 2023.\nBased on such impairment test, the estimated fair value of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656 million, included in Impairment of goodwill on the Consolidated Statement of Income, to reduce the carrying value of AmeriGas Propane to its fair value.\nThe performance of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit. If there is continued deterioration in the results of operations, a portion or all of the remaining recorded goodwill for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, which was $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, could be subject to further impairment.\nSee Note 12 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUGI International Energy Marketing Transactions\nDuring Fiscal 2023 and in October 2023, the Company entered into a number of transactions pursuant to its previously announced decision to exit its European energy marketing business. The European energy marketing business primarily markets natural gas and electricity to customers through third-party distribution systems in France, the Netherlands and, prior to its sales, in Belgium and the United Kingdom.\nFrance. In October 2023, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold substantially all of its energy marketing business located in France for a net cash payment to the buyer of $25 million (which approximates a pre-tax loss) subject to certain adjustments principally related to the pending transfer of certain customer contracts. As of September 30, 2023, the $25 million cash to be paid to the buyer in October 2023 had been placed in escrow and is reflected in Other current assets on the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying values of the assets and liabilities associated with this business, principally comprising certain commodity derivative instruments, energy certificates and certain working capital, have been classified as held-for-sale on the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not recognize any impairment associated with the assets held for sale in Fiscal 2023 because, in accordance with our policy related to such assets, any impairment is limited to the disposal groups long-lived assets, and such assets were not material.\nBelgium. In September 2023, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its energy marketing business located in Belgium for a net cash payment to the buyer of $3 million. Pursuant to the sale agreement, the Company transferred to the buyer certain assets, principally comprising customer and energy broker contracts. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $6 million ($5 million after-tax) which amount includes the net payment to the buyer, the write-off of certain prepaid energy broker payments and associated transaction costs and fees. The loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of UGI International energy marketing business on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nUnited Kingdom. In October 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the U.K. for a net cash payment to the buyer of $19 million which includes certain working capital adjustments. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $215 million ($151 million after-tax) substantially all of which loss was due to the non-cash transfer of commodity derivative instruments associated with the business. The loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of UGI International energy marketing business on the Consolidated Statements of Income. At the date of closing of the sale, these commodity derivative instruments had a net carrying value of $206 million which is attributable to net unrealized gains on such instruments. At September 30, 2022, these derivative instruments were classified as held-for-sale assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and had a net carrying value of $276 million. The change in the carrying value of these derivative instruments between September 30, 2022 and October 21, 2022 resulted from changes in their fair values during that period.\nNetherlands. In September 2023, a substantial number of DVEPs customers agreed to modify their energy marketing contracts whereby the Company will continue to provide for the delivery of electricity and natural gas at fixed prices through December 31, 2023 but the Companys obligations to provide future services will be terminated effective January 1, 2024. As consideration for the early termination of such contracts, the Company has agreed to make cash payments to the customers equal to the fair values of specific commodity derivative instruments associated with periods after December 31, 2023. The carrying values of these commodity derivative instruments are subject to change until such contracts are settled, and the cash payments are made, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of these commodity derivative instruments was $44 million. The early termination agreements with DVEP customers are considered contract modifications and the cash consideration to be paid to these customers has been, and will be, reflected as a reduction in revenues on a pro-rata basis, over the remaining performance period of such agreements through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company reduced its revenues from these customers by $4 million, which represents the pro-rated performance obligation through September 30, 2023 from the aforementioned $44 million.\nIn conjunction with the wind-down of its European energy marketing business, in July 2023, DVEP agreed to sell a substantial portion of its power purchase agreements to a third party for a cash payment to the buyer of $6 million. The closing of the sale is expected to occur during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. The loss from the sale is not expected to be material.\nDuring the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company recorded a $19 million pre-tax impairment charge to reduce the carrying values of certain assets associated with its energy marketing business in the Netherlands, comprising property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. The impairment charge is reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income and included in the UGI International reportable segment.\nGlobal Macroeconomic Conditions\nBeginning in Fiscal 2021 and continuing into Fiscal 2023, global commodity and labor markets have experienced significant inflationary pressures attributable to various economic and political factors, including, among others: supply chain issues including those associated with labor shortages; significant increase and volatility in energy commodity prices; and geopolitical and regulatory conditions resulting from the war between Russia and Ukraine. These factors have contributed to inflationary pressures as evidenced by increases in various consumer price indices. In response to these inflationary pressures, central banks in the U.S. and Europe increased interest rates during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023. In addition, during the last several years, we have experienced significant volatility in energy commodity prices, particularly in LPG, natural gas and electricity prices, which, have resulted in substantial fluctuations in the fair values of our commodity derivative instruments. These inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations have resulted in, among other things, fluctuations in inventory and cost of sales, and increases in certain operating and distribution expenses across all of our businesses. Commodity price fluctuations have also significantly affected the cash collateral deposit requirements of our derivative instrument counterparties and the restricted cash required to be held in our derivative broker and clearing institution accounts. We cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of these conditions and the effects such conditions may have on our future business, financial results, financial position, liquidity and cash flows. However, we continue to monitor and respond to these global economic and geopolitical conditions and remain focused on managing our financial condition and liquidity as these conditions continue to evolve.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nUGI management uses adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation and adjusted diluted earnings per share, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures, when evaluating UGIs overall performance. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to investors about UGIs performance because they eliminate gains and losses on commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions and other significant discrete items that can affect the comparison of period-over-period results.\nUGI does not designate its commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Volatility in net income attributable to UGI Corporation can occur as a result of gains and losses on such derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions. These gains and losses result principally from recording changes in unrealized gains and losses on unsettled commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments and, to a much lesser extent, certain realized gains and losses on settled commodity derivative instruments that are not associated with current-period transactions. However, because these derivative instruments economically hedge anticipated future purchases or sales of energy commodities, or in the case of certain foreign currency derivatives, reduce volatility in anticipated future earnings associated with our foreign operations, we expect that such gains or losses will be largely offset by gains or losses on anticipated future energy commodity transactions or mitigate volatility in anticipated future earnings. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the comparable GAAP measures.\nThe following tables reflect the adjustments referred to above and reconcile net income (loss) attributable to UGI Corporation, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation, and reconcile diluted earnings per share, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to adjusted diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended September 30,\n(Millions of dollars, except per share amounts) 2023 2022\nAdjusted net income (loss) attributable to UGI Corporation:\nAmeriGas Propane $ 71 $ 112\nUGI International 172 175\nMidstream & Marketing 193 163\nUtilities 219 206\nCorporate & Other (a) (2,157) 417\nNet (loss) income attributable to UGI Corporation (1,502) 1,073\nNet losses (gains) on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions (net of tax of $(419) and $140, respectively)\n1,225 (458)\nUnrealized losses (gains) on foreign currency derivative instruments (net of tax of $(11) and $14, respectively)\n27 (36)\nLoss associated with impairment of AmeriGas Propane goodwill (net of tax of $4 and $0, respectively)\n660 -\nLoss on extinguishments of debt (net of tax of $(2) and $(3), respectively)\n7 8\nAcquisition and integration expenses associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition (net of tax of $0 and $(1), respectively)\n- 1\nBusiness transformation expenses (net of tax of $(3) and $(2), respectively)\n7 7\nAmeriGas operations enhancement for growth project (net of tax of $(6) and $(2), respectively)\n18 3\nImpairments of certain equity method investments (net of tax of $0 and $(13), respectively)\n- 22\nRestructuring costs (net of tax of $0 and $(8), respectively)\n- 21\nCosts associated with exit of the UGI International energy marketing business (net of tax of $(67) and $(1), respectively)\n181 4\nNet gain on sale of UGI headquarters building (net of tax of $4 and $0, respectively)\n(10) -\nImpact of change in tax law - (19)\nTotal adjustments (a) (b) 2,115 (447)\nAdjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation $ 613 $ 626\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share:\nAmeriGas Propane $ 0.33 $ 0.52\nUGI International 0.80 0.81\nMidstream & Marketing 0.89 0.76\nUtilities 1.01 0.95\nCorporate & Other (a) (10.19) 1.93\n(Loss) earnings per share - diluted (c) (7.16) 4.97\nNet losses (gains) on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions 5.77 (2.11)\nUnrealized losses (gains) on foreign currency derivative instruments 0.13 (0.17)\nLoss associated with impairment of AmeriGas Propane goodwill 3.14 -\nLoss on extinguishments of debt 0.03 0.03\nBusiness transformation expenses 0.03 0.03\nAmeriGas operations enhancement for growth project 0.09 0.02\nImpairments of certain equity method investments - 0.10\nRestructuring costs - 0.10\nCosts associated with exit of the UGI International energy marketing business 0.86 0.02\nNet gain on sale of UGI headquarters building (0.05) -\nImpact of change in tax law - (0.09)\nTotal adjustments (a) 10.00 (2.07)\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share (c) $ 2.84 $ 2.90\n(a)Corporate & Other includes certain adjustments made to our reporting segments in arriving at net income attributable to UGI Corporation. These adjustments have been excluded from the segment results to align with the measure used by our CODM in assessing segment performance and allocating resources. See Note 22 to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these adjustments, as well as other items included within Corporate & Other.\n(b)Income taxes associated with pre-tax adjustments determined using statutory business unit tax rates.\n(c)The loss per share for Fiscal 2023, was determined excluding the effect of 6.13 million dilutive shares as the impact of such shares would have been antidilutive due to the net loss for the period, while the adjusted earnings per share for Fiscal 2023, was determined based upon fully diluted shares of 215.94 million.\nFiscal 2023 Compared with Fiscal 2022\nDiscussion. Net (loss) income attributable to UGI Corporation was $(1,502) million in Fiscal 2023 (equal to $(7.16) per diluted share) compared to $1,073 million in Fiscal 2022 (equal to $4.97 per diluted share). These results include net (losses) gains from changes in unrealized commodity derivative instruments and certain foreign currency derivative instruments of $(1,252) million and $494 million in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively. The higher losses from changes in commodity derivative instruments in Fiscal 2023 principally reflects significant declines in commodity energy prices in Europe following unprecedented increases in such prices during Fiscal 2022.\nNet loss attributable to UGI Corporation in Fiscal 2023 also includes (1) a $660 million loss associated with impairment of AmeriGas Propane goodwill; (2) $181 million costs associated with exit of our UGI International energy marketing business in Europe, principally reflecting loss on the sale of the energy marketing business located in the U.K. and Belgium and wind-down activities in the Netherlands; (3) external advisory fees of $18 million associated with AmeriGas operations enhancement for growth project; (4) a $10 million net gain on sale of UGI Corporations headquarters building; (5) loss on extinguishment of debt of $7 million at AmeriGas Propane; and (6) business transformation expenses of $7 million associated with corporate support functions.\nNet loss attributable to UGI Corporation in Fiscal 2022 also includes (1) impairments of certain equity method investments of $22 million; (2) restructuring costs of $21 million largely attributable to reductions in workforce and related costs; (3) $19 million of income tax benefits related to tax law changes; (4) loss on extinguishment of debt of $8 million at UGI International; (5) business transformation expenses of $7 million associated with corporate support functions; (6) $4 million costs associated with exit of our UGI International energy marketing business in the U.K.; (7) external advisory fees of $3 million associated with AmeriGas operations enhancement for growth project; and (8) acquisition and integration expenses of $1 million associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition.\nAdjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2023 was $613 million (equal to $2.84 per diluted share) compared to adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation for Fiscal 2022 of $626 million (equal to $2.90 per diluted share). The decrease in adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation during Fiscal 2023 reflects lower earnings contributions from our LPG businesses, primarily AmeriGas Propane. Such decrease was partially offset by higher earnings contributions from our Midstream & Marketing and Utilities segments. In Fiscal 2023, temperatures in all of our business segments, except for AmeriGas Propane, were warmer than the prior year.\nAmeriGas Propanes adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation decreased $41 million during Fiscal 2023. This decrease principally reflects higher operating and administrative expenses primarily resulting from, among other things, higher vehicle expenses, higher overtime and other employee-related costs associated with distribution activity, and the effects of continuing inflationary pressures. These factors were partially offset by higher gains on sales of fixed assets.\nUGI Internationals adjusted net income attributable to UGI Corporation decreased $3 million during Fiscal 2023. This decrease mainly reflects the translation effects of weaker foreign currencies. UGI International operating results principally reflect (1) lower total LPG margin principally due to the effects of the lower LPG retail volumes sold attributable to the significantly warmer weather and lower residential LPG consumption resulting from energy conservation measures in Europe due in large part to the war between Ukraine and Russia; and (2) higher operating and administrative expenses primarily resulting from the effects of continuing inflationary pressures. These decreases were partially offset by higher margin from our natural gas energy marketing activities and higher retail LPG average unit margins attributable to strong margin management efforts and lower commodity prices.\nMidstream & Marketing adjusted net income in Fiscal 2023 was $30 million higher than the prior year. This increase principally reflects incremental earnings contributions from UGI Moraine East and Pennant, partially offset by lower margins related to natural gas marketing activities.\nUtilities Fiscal 2023 adjusted net income increased $13 million compared to the prior year. The increase was largely related to the increase in base rates and the implementation of the weather normalization adjustment at PA Gas Utility, both of which became effective during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023. This increase was partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses.\nAmeriGas Propane 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 2,581 $ 2,943 $ (362) (12) %\nTotal margin (a) $ 1,331 $ 1,330 $ 1 - %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 950 $ 889 $ 61 7 %\nOperating income / earnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 268 $ 307 $ (39) (13) %\nRetail gallons sold (millions) 823 888 (65) (7) %\nDegree days - % colder (warmer) than normal (b) 0.5 % (0.8) % - -\n(a)Total margin represents revenues less cost of sales.\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a rolling 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for 344 regions in the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.\nAverage temperatures during Fiscal 2023 were 0.5% colder than normal and 1.9% colder than the prior year. Total retail propane gallons sold decreased 7% during Fiscal 2023 due to the effects of driver staffing shortages (which also limited growth), continuing customer attribution and structural conservation.\nAverage daily wholesale propane commodity prices during Fiscal 2023 at Mont Belvieu, Texas, one of the major supply points in the U.S., were approximately 39% lower than such prices during Fiscal 2022. Total revenues decreased $362 million during Fiscal 2023 largely reflecting the lower retail propane volumes sold ($179 million), lower wholesale revenues ($100 million) and the effects of lower average retail propane selling prices ($76 million). Total cost of sales decreased $363 million during Fiscal 2023 largely attributable to the lower average propane product costs ($160 million), lower wholesale cost of sales ($101 million) and the lower retail propane volumes sold ($95 million).\nAmeriGas Propane total margin increased $1 million in Fiscal 2023 largely attributable to higher average retail propane unit margins ($84 million), substantially offset by the lower retail propane volumes sold ($83 million).\nAmeriGas Propane operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes decreased $39 million in Fiscal 2023 primarily attributable to higher operating and administrative expenses ($61 million), partially offset by higher other operating income ($21 million), largely related to gains on sales of fixed assets. The increase in operating and administrative expenses reflects, among other things, higher vehicle expenses, higher staffing, overtime and other employee-related costs associated with distribution activity and higher advertising expenses, partially offset by lower salaries and benefits expenses, including the carryover impact of the workforce reductions made during Fiscal 2022.\nUGI International 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 2,965 $ 3,686 $ (721) (20) %\nTotal margin (a) $ 920 $ 935 $ (15) (2) %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 623 $ 611 $ 12 2 %\nOperating income $ 215 $ 237 $ (22) (9) %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 234 $ 254 $ (20) (8) %\nLPG retail gallons sold (millions) 729 799 (70) (9) %\nDegree days - % (warmer) than normal (b) (10.5) % (2.6) % - -\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales.\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a rolling 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data at locations in our UGI International service territories.\nAverage temperatures during Fiscal 2023 were 10.5% warmer than normal and 8.4% warmer than Fiscal 2022. Total LPG retail gallons sold decreased 9% during Fiscal 2023, largely attributable to the significantly warmer weather; lower consumption, principally from residential customers, primarily resulting from the European conservation measures due in large part to high global energy prices and the war between Russia and Ukraine; lower cylinder volumes; and reduced crop drying campaigns. These decreases were partially offset by growth due to natural gas conversions.\nUGI International base-currency results are translated into U.S. dollars based upon exchange rates experienced during the reporting periods. The functional currency of a significant portion of our UGI International results is the euro and, to a much lesser extent, the British pound sterling. During Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the average unweighted euro-to-dollar translation rates were approximately $1.07 and $1.08, respectively, and the average unweighted British pound sterling-to-dollar translation rates were approximately $1.23 and $1.28, respectively. Fluctuations in these foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on the individual financial statement components discussed below. The Company uses forward foreign currency exchange contracts entered into over multi-year periods to reduce the volatility in earnings that may result from such changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulted in realized net gains of $15 million and $13 million in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively.\nAverage wholesale prices for propane and butane during Fiscal 2023 in northwest Europe were approximately 25% and 26% lower, respectively, compared to Fiscal 2022. UGI International revenues and cost of sales decreased $721 million and $706 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2023. The decrease in revenues and cost of sales principally reflects the impact from our energy marketing business of lower volumes sold, partially offset by the impact of higher prices. The decrease in revenues and cost of sales also reflects the impact of the lower LPG retail volumes sold and the lower average LPG product costs. The decrease in revenues and cost of sales also reflects the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies (approximately $115 million and $88 million, respectively).\nUGI International total margin decreased $15 million during Fiscal 2023 primarily reflecting the effects of the lower LPG retail volumes sold ($90 million) and the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies (approximately $27 million). These factors were substantially offset by higher average LPG retail unit margins attributable to strong margin management efforts, the lower average LPG product costs and higher total margin from our energy marketing business ($29 million). The higher energy marketing margin reflects higher natural gas energy marketing margin, partially offset by lower electricity energy marketing margin.\nUGI International operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes decreased $22 million and $20 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2023. The decrease in operating income principally reflects the decrease in total margin ($15 million) and higher operating and administrative expenses ($12 million), partially offset by higher other operating income ($8 million). The higher operating and administrative expenses during Fiscal 2023 primarily reflects the effects of inflationary increases, partially offset by lower distribution and personnel-related costs and the translation effects of the weaker foreign currencies (approximately $11 million). The higher other operating income during Fiscal 2023 primarily represents higher foreign currency transaction gains ($12 million) and higher cylinder deposit income ($5 million), partially offset by lower gains associated with sales of fixed assets ($11 million). The decrease in earnings before interest expense and income taxes in Fiscal 2023 largely reflects the decrease in operating income partially offset by higher realized gains on foreign currency exchange contracts ($2 million) entered into in order to reduce volatility in UGI International earnings resulting from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nMidstream & Marketing 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 1,847 $ 2,326 $ (479) (21) %\nTotal margin (a) $ 487 $ 450 $ 37 8 %\nOperating and administrative expenses $ 133 $ 129 $ 4 3 %\nOperating income $ 285 $ 246 $ 39 16 %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 291 $ 269 $ 22 8 %\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales.\nAverage temperatures across Midstream & Marketings energy marketing territory during Fiscal 2023 were 11.0% warmer than normal and 6.0% warmer than the prior year.\nMidstream & Marketings revenues decreased $479 million during Fiscal 2023, principally reflecting lower revenues from natural gas marketing activities ($519 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity management activities, principally reflecting significantly lower average natural gas prices and, to a lesser extent, lower volumes from the warmer weather. This decrease was partially offset by higher natural gas gathering and processing activities ($43 million), primarily due to the impact on revenues from the prior-year acquisitions of UGI Moraine East and Pennant.\nMidstream & Marketing cost of sales decreased $516 million during Fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting the lower natural gas costs ($511 million) related to the previously mentioned natural gas marketing activities.\nMidstream & Marketing total margin increased $37 million in Fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting incremental natural gas gathering and processing activities ($49 million), primarily from the prior year acquisitions of UGI Moraine East and Pennant, partially offset by lower margins from natural gas marketing activities ($8 million), including the effects of peaking and capacity management activities, despite the benefits from extremely cold weather in late December 2022. In Fiscal 2022, the margin from natural gas marketing activities included the positive impact of settlement timing of certain multi-year commodity storage hedge contracts.\nMidstream & Marketing operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes during Fiscal 2023 increased $39 million and $22 million, respectively. The increase in operating income principally reflects the increase in total margin ($37 million) and higher other operating income ($13 million), partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense ($7 million) and higher operating and administrative expenses ($4 million). The increase in earnings before interest expense and income taxes principally reflects the higher operating income ($39 million), partially offset by lower income from equity investees ($17 million) following the acquisition of the remaining 53% ownership interest in Pennant during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nUtilities 2023 2022 Increase (Decrease)\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevenues $ 1,854 $ 1,620 $ 234 14 %\nTotal margin (a) $ 877 $ 801 $ 76 9 %\nOperating and administrative expenses (a) $ 368 $ 332 $ 36 11 %\nOperating income $ 357 $ 327 $ 30 9 %\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes $ 365 $ 336 $ 29 9 %\nGas Utility system throughput - bcf\nCore market 96 100 (4) (4) %\nTotal 375 363 12 3 %\nElectric Utility distribution sales - gwh 959 997 (38) (4) %\nGas Utility degree days - % (warmer) than normal (b) (11.7) % (7.5) % - -\n(a)Total margin represents total revenues less total cost of sales and revenue-related taxes (i.e. Electric Utility gross receipts and business and occupation taxes) of $24 million and $21 million, respectively, during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022. For financial statement purposes, revenue-related taxes are included in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income (but are excluded from operating expenses presented above).\n(b)Deviation from average heating degree days is determined on a 10-year period utilizing volume-weighted weather data based on weather statistics provided by NOAA for airports located within Gas Utility service territories.\nTemperatures in Gas Utilitys service territories during Fiscal 2023 were 11.7% warmer than normal and 4.8% warmer than the prior year. The decrease in Gas Utility core market volumes during Fiscal 2023 is largely related to the warmer weather, partially offset by growth in the core market customers. The decrease in Electric Utility distribution sales volumes during Fiscal 2023 is primarily attributable to warmer weather.\nUtilities revenues increased $234 million in Fiscal 2023 reflecting a $225 million increase in Gas Utility revenues and a $9 million increase in Electric Utility revenues. The increase in Gas Utility revenues was largely driven by higher PGC and PGA rates reflecting higher natural gas costs; the effects of the increase in base rates and weather normalization adjustments for PA Gas Utility that went into effect during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023; and higher other revenues. These increases were partially offset by the effects on core market volumes of the warmer weather and lower off-system sales. The increase in Electric Utility revenues during Fiscal 2023 was largely driven by higher DS rates, reflecting higher power costs.\nUtilities cost of sales (including revenue-related taxes) was $977 million in Fiscal 2023 compared with $819 million in Fiscal 2022. The increase of $158 million is primarily attributable to Gas Utility ($149 million) mainly reflecting higher PGC and PGA rates and higher other cost of sales, partially offset by lower cost of sales associated with off-system sales. Electric Utility cost of sales increased $9 million in Fiscal 2023 largely reflecting the higher DS rates.\nUtilities total margin increased $76 million during Fiscal 2023 substantially attributable to higher Gas Utility total margin mainly reflecting the effects of the increase in base rates and weather normalization adjustments for PA Gas Utility that went into effect during the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 and, to a much lesser extent, impacts from growth in the core market customers and higher other revenues. Electric Utility margin was comparable to the prior year.\nUtilities operating income and earnings before interest expense and income taxes during Fiscal 2023 increased $30 million and $29 million, respectively, compared to the prior year. These increases largely reflect the previously mentioned increase in total margin, partially offset by higher operating and administrative expenses ($36 million) and higher depreciation expense ($8 million). The higher operating and administrative expenses reflect, among other things, higher uncollectible accounts expenses, contract labor costs and personnel-related expenses. The higher depreciation expense compared to the prior year reflects the effects of continued distribution system capital expenditure activity.\nInterest Expense and Income Taxes\nOur consolidated interest expense during Fiscal 2023 was $379 million compared to $329 million during the prior year. The increase in interest expense largely reflects higher credit agreement interest rates and borrowings, higher average interest rates on UGI Corporation long-term debt and higher average long-term debt outstanding principally at our Utilities and Midstream & Marketing segments.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased between Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2023, primarily due to the release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of foreign tax credits and the availability of investment tax credits in Fiscal 2023 that were not available in Fiscal 2022. These decreases were partially offset by (1) a higher concentration of pre-tax losses in higher income tax rate jurisdictions resulting from losses on derivative instruments; (2) establishing a valuation allowance for interest expense disallowance at AmeriGas Propane; and (3) the impact on income taxes from the goodwill impairment at AmeriGas Propane, which included certain adjustments to the associated deferred tax assets. For additional information on our income taxes, including tax law changes, see Note 7 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\nThe Company expects to have sufficient liquidity including cash on hand and available borrowing capacity, to continue to support long-term commitments and ongoing operations despite uncertainties associated with ongoing global macroeconomic conditions including, among others, changes in consumer behavior, the inflationary cost environment and ongoing energy commodity price volatility. Our total available liquidity balance, comprising cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facilities, totaled approximately $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company does not have any senior notes or term loans maturing in the next twelve months. The Company cannot predict the duration or total magnitude of the uncertain economic factors mentioned above and the total effects they will have on its liquidity, debt covenants, financial condition or the timing of capital expenditures. UGI and its subsidiaries were in compliance with its debt covenants as of September 30, 2023. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on compliance.\nWe depend on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide funds for working capital and to fund capital requirements. Our short-term cash requirements not met by cash from operations are generally satisfied with borrowings under credit facilities and, in the case of Midstream & Marketing, also from a Receivables Facility. Long-term cash requirements are generally met through the issuance of long-term debt or equity securities. We believe that each of our business units has sufficient liquidity in the forms of cash and cash equivalents on hand; cash expected to be generated from operations; credit facility and Receivables Facility borrowing capacity; and the ability to obtain long-term financing to meet anticipated contractual and projected cash commitments. Issuances of debt and equity securities in the capital markets and additional credit facilities may not, however, be available to us on acceptable terms.\nThe primary sources of UGIs cash and cash equivalents are the dividends and other cash payments made to UGI or its corporate subsidiaries by its principal business units. Our cash and cash equivalents totaled $241 million at September 30, 2023, compared with $405 million at September 30, 2022. Excluding cash and cash equivalents that reside at UGIs operating subsidiaries, at September 30, 2023 and 2022, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $51 million and $140 million, respectively. Such cash is available to pay dividends on UGI Common Stock and for investment purposes. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents since September 30, 2022, can be attributed to, among other things, temporary restrictions on the payment of dividends from AmeriGas OLP to UGI resulting from the use of an equity cure, as defined by the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement and an increase in cash outflow in the form of capital contributions to AmeriGas Partners. In November 2023, the Company amended the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit agreement to reduce both the revolver amount and the minimum interest\ncoverage ratio. As of September 30, 2023 the Partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants as set forth in the amended 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement without the consideration of the equity cure provisions, alleviating the restriction on the subsidiaries ability to pay dividends to the parent. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDuring Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, our principal business units paid cash dividends and made other cash payments to UGI and its subsidiaries as follows:\n(Millions of dollars) 2023 2022\nAmeriGas Propane $ - $ 227\nUGI International 248 116\nMidstream & Marketing 215 -\nUtilities 5 -\nTotal $ 468 $ 343\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nIssuance of Equity Units\nOn May 25, 2021, the Company issued 2.2 million Equity Units with a total notional value of $220 million. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and consists of (1) a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and (2) a 2024 Purchase Contract. The Company received approximately $213 million in proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions, and issued 220,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock, recording $213 million in Preferred stock on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition and related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. For additional information on the Mountaineer Acquisition and the issuance of Equity Units, see Notes 5 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nQuarterly dividends per share of UGI Common Stock paid during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 were as follows:\n2023 2022\n1st Quarter\n$ 0.360 $ 0.345\n2nd Quarter\n0.360 0.345\n3rd Quarter\n0.375 0.360\n4th Quarter\n0.375 0.360\nTotal $ 1.470 $ 1.410\nOn November 16, 2023, UGIs Board of Directors declared a cash dividend equal to $0.375 per common share. The dividend will be payable on January 1, 2024, to shareholders of record on December 15, 2023.\nRepurchases of Common Stock\nDuring Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 600,000 shares and 900,000 shares of its common stock at a total purchase price of $22 million and $38 million, respectively. For additional information on the authorization of these repurchases, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nLong-term Debt and Credit Facilities\nThe Companys debt outstanding at September 30, 2023 and 2022, comprised the following:\n2023 2022\n(Millions of dollars) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corp. & Other Total Total\nShort-term borrowings $ - $ 214 $ 103 $ 332 $ - $ 649 $ 368\nLong-term debt (including current maturities):\nSenior notes $ 2,400 $ 424 $ - $ 1,505 $ - $ 4,329 $ 4,472\nTerm loans - 317 794 129 727 1,967 1,871\nOther long-term debt - 6 41 21 283 351 322\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (15) (8) (15) (6) (3) (47) (33)\nTotal long-term debt $ 2,385 $ 739 $ 820 $ 1,649 $ 1,007 $ 6,600 $ 6,632\nTotal debt $ 2,385 $ 953 $ 923 $ 1,981 $ 1,007 $ 7,249 $ 7,000\nSignificant Financing Activities\n2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. Under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, AmeriGas OLP, as borrower, is required to comply with financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage measured at the Partnership and at AmeriGas OLP. On November 15, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, which amends certain provisions of the credit agreement dated as of September 28, 2022 to, among other things, (i) reduce the maximum revolver amount from $600 million to $400 million, (ii) reduce the minimum interest coverage ratio, effective for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 through the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024 and (iii) beginning for the first quarter of Fiscal 2025, the minimum interest coverage ratio will remain reduced if the net leverage ratio is below a threshold as defined by the agreement; if the net leverage ratio exceeds such threshold, the minimum interest coverage ratio will revert to the original ratio as defined by the agreement.\nAs of March 31, 2023, AmeriGas OLP was in breach of the leverage ratio debt covenant and interest coverage ratio, which it cured with the funds received from UGI. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement contains an equity cure provision, which allows AmeriGas OLPs direct or indirect parent, including UGI and its other subsidiaries, to fund capital contributions to eliminate any EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement) shortfalls that would otherwise result in non-compliance with these financial covenants. UGI made capital contributions to AmeriGas OLP of $20 million and $11 million on March 31, 2023 and April 24, 2023, respectively, which in aggregate represented one equity cure in accordance with the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. As a result of these capital contributions, AmeriGas OLP and the Partnership were in compliance with its financial covenants after considering the equity cure provision as of June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2023 the Partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants as set forth in the amended 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement without the consideration of the equity cure provisions.\nUGI also provided an irrevocable letter of support whereby UGI has committed to fund any such EBITDA shortfalls and debt service, if any. Based on the support and the projected EBITDA, AmeriGas OLP is expected to remain in compliance with its financial debt covenants for the succeeding twelve-month period. In addition, in May 2023, the Company contributed $52 million in an equity contribution to AmeriGas Partners principally to fund debt service on AmeriGas Partners Senior Notes.\nUGI Utilities 2023 Credit Agreement. On November 9, 2023, UGI Utilities entered into the UGI Utilities 2023 Credit Agreement providing for borrowings up to $375 million (including a $50 million sublimit for letters of credit and a $38 million sublimit for swingline loans). UGI Utilities may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments under the credit agreement to a maximum aggregate amount of $125 million. The interest rates applicable to borrowings under the UGI Utilities 2023 Credit Agreement will remain unchanged. The credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions and requires compliance with certain financial covenants including a maximum debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. The maturity of the credit agreement was extended to November 2024 with an additional automatic 5-year extension upon receipt of authorization for such extension from the PAPUC. Borrowings under the credit agreement may be used to refinance UGI Utilities existing indebtedness, finance the working capital needs of UGI Utilities and for general corporate purposes.\nOn December 13, 2022, UGI Utilities entered into an amendment to the UGI Utilities Credit Agreement, providing for borrowings up to $425 million and to replace the use of LIBOR with Term SOFR.\nAmeriGas Partners Senior Notes. On May 31, 2023, AmeriGas Partners and AmeriGas Finance Corp. issued $500 million principal amount of 9.375% Senior Notes due May 2028. The 9.375% Senior Notes rank equally with AmeriGas Partners existing senior notes. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 9.375% Senior Notes, together with cash on hand, a $150 million cash contribution from the Company and other sources of liquidity, were used for the early repayment, pursuant to a tender offer and notice of redemption, of all AmeriGas Partners 5.625% Senior Notes having an aggregate principal balance of $675 million, plus tender premiums and accrued and unpaid interest. In conjunction with the early repayment of the 5.625% Senior Notes, in June 2023 the Partnership recognized a pre-tax loss of $9 million primarily comprising tender premiums and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs, which is reflected in Loss on extinguishments of debt on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nUGI International 2023 Credit Facilities Agreement. On March 7, 2023, UGI International, LLC and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, UGI International Holdings B.V., entered into the UGI International 2023 Credit Facilities Agreement, a five-year unsecured senior facilities agreement, maturing March 7, 2028, with a consortium of banks. The UGI International 2023 Credit Facilities Agreement consists of (1) a \u20ac300 million variable-rate term loan facility (\"Facility A\") and (2) a \u20ac500 million multicurrency revolving credit facility, including a \u20ac100 million sublimit for swingline loans (\"Facility B\"). We have designated borrowings under Facility A as a net investment hedge. In connection with the entering into of the UGI International 2023 Credit Facilities Agreement, UGI International, LLC paid off in full and terminated the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement, dated as of October 18, 2018. Borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility may be used to finance the working capital needs of UGI International, LLC and its subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes.\nUGI Energy Services Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2023, Energy Services entered into the second amendment to the UGI Energy Services Credit Agreement, which provides that the Term SOFR rate (as defined in the UGI Energy Services Credit Agreement) shall replace LIBOR as a reference rate. After giving effect to the second amendment, the UGI Energy Services Credit Agreement shall bear interest at a floating rate of, at Energy Services option, either (i) Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the UGI Energy Services Credit Agreement) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, or (ii) the base rate plus the Applicable Rate. The Applicable Rate will be based on the leverage of Energy Services.\nEnergy Services Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement. On February 23, 2023, Energy Services entered into the Energy Services Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, the first amendment to the Energy Services Term Loan Credit Agreement, dated August 13, 2019. The Energy Services Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement provides, among other items, that (i) the outstanding principal amount of the loans shall be increased by $125 million to $800 million, (ii) the maturity date of the loans shall be extended to February 22, 2030, and (iii) Term SOFR (as defined in the Energy Services Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement) shall replace LIBOR as a reference rate.\nMountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement. On October 20, 2022, Mountaineer entered into the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement, as borrower, with a group of lenders. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement amends and restates a previous credit agreement and provides for borrowings up to $150 million, including a $20 million sublimit for letters of credit. Mountaineer may request an increase in the amount of loan commitments to a maximum aggregate amount of $250 million, subject to certain terms and conditions. Borrowings under the Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement can be used to finance the working capital needs of Mountaineer and for general corporate purposes. The Mountaineer 2023 Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in November 2024, and Mountaineer has the option, with the consent of the lenders, to request extension of the maturity date to November 2025, and then to November 2026, upon fulfillment of specified conditions.\nUGI Corporation Credit Facility Agreement. On May 12, 2023, the Company entered into the second amendment to the UGI Corporation Credit Agreement, which provides that the Term SOFR rate (as defined in the UGI Corporation Credit Agreement) shall replace LIBOR as a reference rate. After giving effect to the second amendment, the UGI Corporation Credit Agreement shall bear interest at a floating rate of, at the Companys option, either (i) Term SOFR plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the UGI Corporation Credit Agreement) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, or (ii) the base rate plus the applicable margin that will be based on the leverage of the Company or credit ratings assigned to certain indebtedness of the Company.\nOn September 20, 2023, UGI amended the UGI Corporation Credit Facility Agreement which extended the maturity date of the (1) five-year $250 million amortizing variable-rate term loan and (2) five-year $300 million revolving credit facility to May 2025 and increased the applicable rates (as defined in the amended UGI Corporation Credit Agreement) by 0.125%.\nCredit Facilities\nInformation about the Companys principal credit agreements (excluding Energy Services Receivables Facility, which is discussed below) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, is presented in the tables below.\n(Currency in millions) Expiration Date Total Capacity Borrowings Outstanding Letters of Credit and Guarantees Outstanding Available Borrowing Capacity Weighted Average Interest Rate - End of Year\nSeptember 30, 2023\nAmeriGas OLP September 2026 $ 600 $ - $ 2 $ 598 N.A.\nUGI International, LLC (a) March 2028 \u20ac 500 \u20ac 202 \u20ac - \u20ac 298 5.17 %\nEnergy Services March 2025 $ 260 $ 57 $ - $ 203 7.67 %\nUGI Utilities (c) June 2024 $ 425 $ 248 $ - $ 177 6.30 %\nMountaineer November 2024 $ 150 $ 84 $ - $ 66 6.68 %\nUGI Corporation (b) May 2025 $ 300 $ 283 $ - $ 17 7.80 %\nSeptember 30, 2022\nAmeriGas OLP September 2026 $ 600 $ 131 $ 2 $ 467 7.27 %\nUGI International, LLC (a) October 2023 \u20ac 300 \u20ac - \u20ac - \u20ac 300 N.A.\nEnergy Services March 2025 $ 260 $ - $ - $ 260 N.A.\nUGI Utilities June 2024 $ 350 $ 151 $ - $ 199 4.37 %\nMountaineer November 2024 $ 100 $ 85 $ - $ 15 3.82 %\nUGI Corporation (b) August 2024 $ 300 $ 252 $ - $ 48 5.62 %\n(a)Permits UGI International, LLC to borrow in euros or USD.\n(b)Borrowings outstanding have been classified as Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Subsequent to September 30, 2022, the Company repaid $87 million of such borrowings and classified these repayments as Current maturities of long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(c)On November 9, 2023, UGI Utilities entered into the UGI Utilities 2023 Credit Agreement and concurrently terminated the UGI Utilities Credit Agreement, a predecessor agreement. See Significant Financing Activities above and Note 6 for additional information.\nN.A. - Not applicable\nThe average daily and peak short-term borrowings under the Companys principal credit agreements are as follows:\n2023 2022\n(Currency in millions) Average Peak Average Peak\nAmeriGas OLP $ 79 $ 242 $ 181 $ 388\nUGI International, LLC \u20ac 203 \u20ac 300 \u20ac 77 \u20ac 250\nEnergy Services $ 13 $ 82 $ - $ -\nUGI Utilities $ 190 $ 340 $ 163 $ 270\nMountaineer $ 73 $ 101 $ 53 $ 85\nUGI Corporation $ 249 $ 296 $ 191 $ 288\nReceivables Facility. Energy Services has a Receivables Facility with an issuer of receivables-backed commercial paper. On October 20, 2023, the expiration date of the Receivables Facility was extended to October 18, 2024. The Receivables Facility provides Energy Services with the ability to borrow up to $200 million of eligible receivables during the period October 20, 2023 to April 30, 2024, and up to $100 million of eligible receivables during the period May 1, 2024 to October 18, 2024. Energy Services uses the Receivables Facility to fund working capital, margin calls under commodity futures contracts, capital expenditures, dividends and for general corporate purposes.\nUnder the Receivables Facility, Energy Services transfers, on an ongoing basis and without recourse, its trade accounts receivable to its wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary, ESFC, which is consolidated for financial statement purposes.\nESFC, in turn, has sold and, subject to certain conditions, may from time to time sell, an undivided interest in some or all of the receivables to a major bank. Amounts sold to the bank are reflected as Short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ESFC was created and has been structured to isolate its assets from creditors of Energy Services and its affiliates, including UGI. Trade receivables sold to the bank remain on the Companys balance sheet and the Company reflects a liability equal to the amount advanced by the bank. The Company records interest expense on amounts owed to the bank. Energy Services continues to service, administer and collect trade receivables on behalf of the bank, as applicable.\nAt September 30, 2023, the outstanding balance of trade receivables was $62 million, $46 million of which were sold to the bank. At September 30, 2022, the outstanding balance of trade receivables was $101 million, none of which was sold to the bank. Amounts sold to the bank are reflected as Short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. During Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, peak sales of receivables were $150 million and $98 million, respectively. During Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, average daily amounts sold were $46 million and $2 million, respectively.\nFor further information on the Companys long-term debt, credit facilities and the Receivables Facility, see Note 6 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash Flows\nDue to the seasonal nature of the Companys businesses, cash flows from operating activities are generally strongest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for natural gas, LPG, electricity and other energy products and services consumed during the peak heating season months. Conversely, operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the fourth and first fiscal quarters when the Companys investment in working capital, principally inventories and accounts receivable, is generally greatest.\nOperating Activities:\nYear-to-year variations in our cash flows from operating activities can be significantly affected by changes in operating working capital, especially during periods with significant changes in energy commodity prices. Cash flows from operating activities in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 were $1,107 million and $716 million, respectively. The increase in cash flow from operations principally reflects greater cash flow from changes in operating working capital offset in part by higher net derivative instrument collateral repayments. Cash flows from operating activities before changes in operating working capital were $1,258 million in Fiscal 2023 and $1,269 million in Fiscal 2022. Changes in operating working capital and collateral deposits used operating cash flow of $151 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to $553 million of cash flow used in Fiscal 2022. The significant decrease in cash used to fund changes in operating working capital principally reflects lower cash used to fund changes in accounts receivable and inventories partially offset by a significant increase in collateral deposit repayments and cash required to fund changes in accounts payable. These changes in operating working capital and collateral deposits principally reflect the effects of the previously mentioned significant decrease in commodity energy prices during Fiscal 2023, principally at UGI International and Midstream & Marketing.\nInvesting Activities:\nInvesting activity cash flow is principally affected by cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment; cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and assets; investments in equity method investees; and cash proceeds from sales and retirements of property, plant and equipment. Cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment totaled $974 million in Fiscal 2023 and $804 million in Fiscal 2022. The increase in cash payments for property, plant and equipment in Fiscal 2023 compared with Fiscal 2022 principally reflects higher cash capital expenditures in our Midstream & Marketing segment due in large part to the investments in committed renewable energy projects and new LNG facilities and, to a lesser extent, slightly higher cash capital expenditures at our Utilities segment. Cash used for acquisitions of businesses and assets in Fiscal 2023 reflects a small acquisition in Europe while Fiscal 2022 includes the Stonehenge Acquisition and the Pennant Acquisition. Cash used for investments in equity method investees was $146 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to $47 million in Fiscal 2022 principally reflecting investments in biomass and renewable energy projects at our Midstream & Marketing reportable segment and, to a much lesser extent, our investment in a renewable energy joint venture at UGI International. Cash inflows associated with investing activities during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 also includes cash received from the settlement of certain forward foreign currency contracts previously designated as net investment hedges.\nFinancing Activities:\nChanges in cash flow from financing activities are primarily due to issuances and repayments of long-term debt; net short-term borrowings; dividends on UGI Common Stock; quarterly payments on outstanding Purchase Contracts; and issuances and repurchases of equity instruments.\nCash flow used by financing activities was $168 million in Fiscal 2023 compared to cash flow used by financing activities of $51 million in Fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 activities include (1) entering into the previously mentioned UGI International 2023 Credit Facilities Agreement in March 2023 and the concurrent repayment of borrowings under the UGI International Credit Facilities Agreement (a predecessor agreement); (2) entering into the previously mentioned Energy Services Amended Term Loan Agreement in February 2023 and the concurrent repayment of amounts outstanding under the Energy Services variable rate term loan; and (3) the May 2023 issuance of $500 million principal amount of AmeriGas Partners 9.375% Senior Notes and the repayment of the $675 million aggregate principal balance of AmeriGas Partners 5.625% Senior Notes. During Fiscal 2022, UGI International issued \u20ac400 million principal amount of senior notes and Utilities issued a combined $215 million principal amount of senior notes. Proceeds from the Fiscal 2022 UGI International senior notes were used to repay existing long-term debt, while proceeds from the Utilities notes were used to reduce short-term borrowings and for general corporate purposes. In Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the Company had aggregate net borrowings from credit facilities and the Receivables Facility totaling $267 million and $1 million, respectively.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn the following table, we present capital expenditures (which exclude acquisitions of businesses and assets) for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022. We also provide amounts we expect to spend in Fiscal 2024. We expect to finance a substantial portion of our Fiscal 2024 capital expenditures from cash generated by operations and cash on hand.\n(Millions of dollars) 2024\n(estimate) 2023 2022\nAmeriGas Propane $ 100 $ 134 $ 128\nUGI International 70 129 107\nMidstream & Marketing 163 130 38\nUtilities 499 563 562\nTotal $ 832 $ 956 $ 835\nThe increases in capital expenditures at Midstream & Marketing in Fiscal 2023, and the projected increase in Fiscal 2024, reflect increased levels of capital expenditures associated with investments in renewable energy projects and in new LNG facilities.\nContractual Cash Obligations and Commitments\nThe Company has contractual cash obligations that extend beyond Fiscal 2023. The following table presents contractual cash obligations with non-affiliates under agreements existing as of September 30, 2023:\nPayments Due by Period\n(Millions of dollars) Total Fiscal\n2024 Fiscal\n2025 - 2026 Fiscal\n2027 - 2028 Thereafter\nShort-term borrowings (a) $ 649 $ 649 $ - $ - $ -\nLong-term debt (a) 6,647 57 2,651 1,468 2,471\nInterest on long-term fixed-rate debt (a)(b)(c) 2,183 381 600 309 893\nOperating leases 502 104 158 110 130\nAmeriGas Propane supply contracts 10 10 - - -\nUGI International supply contracts 464 464 - - -\nMidstream & Marketing supply contracts 1,020 277 199 120 424\nUtilities construction, supply, storage and transportation contracts 401 173 116 67 45\nDerivative instruments (d) 99 69 29 1 -\nTotal $ 11,975 $ 2,184 $ 3,753 $ 2,075 $ 3,963\n(a)Based upon stated maturity dates for debt outstanding at September 30, 2023.\n(b)Based upon stated interest rates adjusted for the effects of interest rate swaps.\n(c)Calculated using applicable interest rates or forward interest rate curves, and UGIs and its subsidiaries leverage ratios, as of September 30, 2023.\n(d)Represents the sum of amounts due if derivative instrument liabilities were settled at the September 30, 2023 amounts reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet (but excluding amounts associated with interest rate contracts).\nOther noncurrent liabilities included in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2023, principally comprise operating lease liabilities (see Note 15 to Consolidated Financial Statements); regulatory liabilities (see Note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements); refundable tank and cylinder deposits (as further described in Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption Refundable Tank and Cylinder Deposits); litigation, property and casualty liabilities and obligations under environmental remediation agreements (see Note 16 to Consolidated Financial Statements); pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recorded in accordance with accounting guidance relating to employee retirement plans (see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements); and liabilities associated with executive compensation plans (see Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements). These liabilities, with the exception of operating lease liabilities, are not included in the table of Contractual Cash Obligations and Commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans (as further described below under U.S. Pension Plans) in Fiscal 2024 are $22 million. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans in years beyond Fiscal 2024 will depend, in large part, on the impacts of future returns on pension plan assets and interest rates on pension plan liabilities.\nU.S. Pension Plans\nThe U.S. Pension Plans consist of (1) a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, of UGI, UGI Utilities, and certain of UGIs other domestic wholly owned subsidiaries, and (2) a defined benefit pension plan for Mountaineer employees hired prior to January 1, 2023. The fair values of the U.S. Pension Plans assets totaled $539 million and $525 million at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the underfunded positions of the U.S. Pension Plans, defined as the excess of the PBO over the U.S. Pension Plans assets, were $55 million and $82 million, respectively.\nWe believe we are in compliance with regulations governing defined benefit pension plans, including the ERISA rules and regulations. Required minimum contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans in Fiscal 2024 is $22 million.\nGAAP guidance associated with pension and other postretirement plans generally requires recognition of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans with current year changes recognized in shareholders equity unless such amounts are subject to regulatory recovery. At September 30, 2023, we have recorded pre-tax credits to UGI Corporations stockholders equity of $4 million and recorded regulatory assets totaling $111 million in order to reflect the funded status of the U.S. Pension Plans. For a more detailed discussion of the U.S. Pension Plans and our other postretirement benefit plans, see Note 8 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, we did not enter into any related-party transactions that had a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOff-Balance-Sheet Arrangements\nUGI primarily enters into guarantee arrangements on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries. These arrangements are not subject to the recognition and measurement guidance relating to guarantees under GAAP.\nWe do not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements that are expected to have a material effect on our financial condition, change in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nUtility Regulatory Matters\nUGI Utilities. On January 27, 2023, Electric Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $11 million. On September 21, 2023, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $9 million annual base distribution rate increase for Electric Utility, effective October 1, 2023.\nOn January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $83 million annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $49 million annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $38 million beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $11 million beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024.\nAlso in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a five-year pilot program beginning on November 1, 2022. Under this rider, when weather deviates from normal by more than 3%, residential and small commercial customer billings for distribution services are adjusted monthly for weather related impacts exceeding the 3% threshold. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reached $3,368 million (which threshold was achieved in September 2022).\nOn February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $9 million. On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $6 million.\nMountaineer. On July 31, 2023, Mountaineer submitted its 2023 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of $10 million, an increase of $6 million, for costs associated with capital investments after December 31, 2022, that total $131 million, including $67 million in calendar year 2024. With new base rates expected to be effective January 1, 2024, revenues from IREP rates would decrease by $12 million. The filing included capital investments totaling $383 million over the 2024 - 2028 period.\nOn March 6, 2023, Mountaineer submitted a base rate case filing with the WVPSC seeking a net revenue increase of $20 million, which consisted of an increase in base rates of $38 million and a decrease in the IREP rates of $18 million annually to be effective on April 5, 2023. On March 31, 2023, the WVPSC suspended the effective date of the requested rate change increase until January 1, 2024 to allow for a full review of the filing. On October 6, 2023, Mountaineer filed a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement of the base rate case, which included a $14 million net revenue increase. An order from the Commission is expected in December and new rates will take effect on January 1, 2024.\nOn July 29, 2022, Mountaineer submitted its 2022 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of costs associated with capital investments totaling $354 million over the 2023 - 2027 period, including $64 million in calendar year 2023. On November 16, 2022, Mountaineer and the intervening parties submitted a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement to the WVPSC requesting approval of 2023 IREP revenue of $22 million to be charged effective January 1, 2023, which includes the recovery of a $1 million under-recovery of 2021 IREP revenue. On December 21, 2022, the WVPSC issued an order approving the joint stipulation and agreement for settlement as filed.\nOther Matters\nWest Reading, Pennsylvania Explosion. On March 24, 2023, an explosion occurred in West Reading, Pennsylvania which resulted in seven fatalities, significant injuries to eleven others, and extensive property damage to buildings owned by R.M. Palmer, a local chocolate manufacturer, and other neighboring structures. The NTSB and the PAPUC are investigating the West Reading incident. On July 18, 2023, the NTSB issued an Investigative Update in its ongoing investigation. The report identifies a fracture in a retired UGI gas service tee and a fracture in a nearby steam system, but it does not address causation of the fractures or the explosion. The NTSB investigative team includes representatives from the Company, the PAPUC, the local fire department and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. The NTSB may invite other parties to participate. In September 2023, OSHA closed their investigation of this matter, without any finding pertaining to UGI Utilities.\nWhile the investigation into this incident is still underway and the cause of the explosion has not been determined, the Company has received claims as a result of the explosion and is involved in lawsuits relative to the incident. The Company maintains liability insurance for personal injury, property and casualty damages and believes that third-party claims associated with the explosion, in excess of the Companys deductible, are recoverable through the Companys insurance. The Company cannot predict the result of these pending or future claims and legal actions at this time.\nRegarding these pending claims and legal actions, the Company does not believe, at this early stage, that there is sufficient information available to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, or conclude that the final outcome of these matters will or will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nOur primary market risk exposures are (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nCommodity Price Risk\nThe risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the Partnership and our UGI International operations pay for LPG is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for LPG and other energy commodities. Their profitability is sensitive to changes in LPG supply costs. Increases in supply costs are generally passed on to customers. The Partnership and UGI International may not, however, always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis, particularly when product costs rise rapidly. In order to reduce the volatility of LPG market price risk, the Partnership uses contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane, propane fixed-price supply agreements and over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts. Our UGI International operations use over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments and may from time to time enter into other derivative contracts, similar to those used by the Partnership, to reduce market risk associated with a portion of their LPG purchases. Over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments used to economically hedge forecasted purchases of LPG are generally settled at expiration of the contract.\nUtilities tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to its retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs. The recovery clauses provide for periodic adjustments for the difference between the total amounts actually billed to customers through PGC and PGA rates and the recoverable costs incurred. Because of this ratemaking mechanism, there is limited commodity price risk associated with our Utilities operations. PA Gas Utility uses derivative financial instruments, including natural gas futures and option contracts traded on the NYMEX, to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. The cost of these derivative financial instruments, net of any associated gains or losses, is included in PA Gas Utility's PGC recovery mechanism.\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to substantially all of Midstream & Marketings fixed-price sale contracts for physical natural gas and electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX, ICE and over-the-counter natural gas and electricity futures and option contracts, and natural gas basis swap contracts or enters into fixed-price supply arrangements. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge a portion of its anticipated sales of electricity from its electricity generation facilities. Although Midstream & Marketings fixed-price supply arrangements mitigate significant risks associated with its fixed-price sales contracts, should any of the suppliers under these arrangements fail to perform, increases, if any, in the cost of replacement natural gas or electricity would adversely impact Midstream & Marketings results. Any volume deviations from the amounts forecasted under fixed-price requirement sale contracts, would introduce price risks, which could adversely impact Midstream & Marketings results. In order to reduce this risk of supplier nonperformance, Midstream & Marketing has diversified its purchases across a number of suppliers. UGI Internationals natural gas and electricity marketing businesses also use natural gas and electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales and purchase contracts. See Note 5 to Consolidated Financial Statements regarding recent transactions related to UGI Internationals energy marketing business.\nMidstream & Marketing has entered into fixed-price sales agreements for a portion of the electricity expected to be generated by its electric generation assets. In the event that these generation assets would not be able to produce all of the electricity needed to supply electricity under these agreements, Midstream & Marketing would be required to purchase electricity on the spot market or under contract with other electricity suppliers. Accordingly, increases in the cost of replacement power could negatively impact Midstream & Marketings results.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have both fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable-rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value. Conversely, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt but do not impact their cash flows.\nOur variable-rate debt at September 30, 2023, includes revolving credit facility borrowings and variable-rate term loans at UGI International, Utilities, Energy Services and UGI Corporation. These debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates. We have entered into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements on all or a significant portion of the term loans principal balances and all or a significant portion of the term loans tenor. We have designated these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2023, combined borrowings outstanding under variable-rate debt agreements, excluding the previously mentioned effectively fixed-rate debt, totaled $1,272 million. Based upon average borrowings outstanding under variable-rate borrowings (excluding effectively fixed-rate term loan debt), an increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased our Fiscal 2023 interest expense by approximately $12 million. The remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed-rate debt of approximately $160 million\nat September 30, 2023. A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair value of this fixed-rate debt of approximately $220 million at September 30, 2023.\nLong-term debt associated with our domestic businesses is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt with similar terms and credit ratings. As these long-term debt issues mature, we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce interest rate risk associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt, from time to time we enter into IRPAs.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nOur primary currency exchange rate risk is associated with the USD versus the euro and, to a lesser extent, the USD versus the British pound sterling. The USD value of our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in the associated foreign currency exchange rates. From time to time, we use derivative instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. Gains or losses on these net investment hedges remain in AOCI until such foreign operations are sold or liquidated. With respect to our net investments in our UGI International operations, a 10% decline in the value of the associated foreign currencies versus the USD would reduce their aggregate net book value at September 30, 2023, by approximately $70 million, which amount would be reflected in other comprehensive income. We have designated certain euro-denominated borrowings as net investment hedges.\nIn order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate between the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over a multi-year period to eventually equal approximately 90% of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes.\nDerivative Instrument Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.\nWe have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross fair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $298 million. In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At September 30, 2023, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $40 million. In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnerships derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of the Partnerships debt rating. At September 30, 2023, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of unsettled market risk sensitive derivative instrument assets (liabilities) held at September 30, 2023 and changes in their fair values due to market risks. Certain of UGI Utilities commodity derivative instruments are excluded from the table below because any associated net gains or losses are refundable to or recoverable from customers in accordance with UGI Utilities ratemaking.\nAsset (Liability)\n(Millions of dollars) Fair Value Change in\nFair Value\nSeptember 30, 2023\nCommodity price risk (1) $ (40) $ (148)\nInterest rate risk (2) $ 28 $ (16)\nForeign currency exchange rate risk (3) $ 36 $ (46)\n(1)Change in fair value represents a 10% adverse change in the market prices of certain commodities\n(2)Change in fair value represents a 50 basis point adverse change in prevailing market interest rates\n(3)Change in fair value represents a 10% adverse change in the value of the Euro and the British pound sterling versus the USD.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting policies and estimates discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The application of these accounting policies and estimates necessarily requires managements most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events. Changes in these policies and estimates could have a material effect on our financial statements. Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies, and the estimates and assumptions associated with them, with the Companys Audit Committee. Also, see Note 2 to Consolidated Financial Statements which discusses our significant accounting policies.\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation. Our goodwill is the result of business acquisitions. We do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment (a component), if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. A reporting unit with goodwill is required to perform an impairment test annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\nFor certain of our reporting units with goodwill, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For our other reporting units with goodwill, we bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment by comparing the fair values of the reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. We determine fair values generally based on a weighting of income and market approaches. For purposes of the income approach, fair values are determined based upon the present value of the reporting units estimated future cash flows, including an estimate of the reporting units terminal value based upon these cash flows, discounted at appropriate risk-adjusted rates. We use our internal forecasts to estimate future cash flows, which may include estimates of long-term future growth rates based upon our most recent reviews of the long-term outlook for each reporting unit. Cash flow estimates used to establish fair values under our income approach involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and historical results. In addition, external economic and competitive conditions can influence future performance. For purposes of the market approach, we use valuation multiples for companies comparable to our reporting units. The market approach requires judgment to determine the appropriate valuation multiples. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess but not to exceed the total amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company identified interim impairment indicators related to goodwill within the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit: (1) AmeriGas Partners issued $500 million of Senior Notes at an interest rate of 9.375%, which was significantly higher than the interest rates on the other AmeriGas Propane debt obligations; and (2) financial projections for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit were reduced significantly compared to previous forecasts following declines in gross margins and customer retention and higher operating expenses. The Company concluded that these events constituted triggering events that indicate that the AmeriGas Propane goodwill may be impaired and, as such, performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill as of May 31, 2023.\nUsing level 3 inputs, we performed a quantitative assessment of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit using a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine its fair value. With respect to the income approach, management used a discounted cash flow (DCF) method, using unobservable inputs. The significant assumptions in our DCF model include projected EBITDA and a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs). With respect to the market approach, management used recent transaction market multiples for similar companies in the U.S. The resulting estimates of fair value from the income approach and the market approach were then weighted equally in determining the overall estimated fair value of AmeriGas Propane.\nBased on our evaluation, the estimated fair value of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656 million, included in Impairment of goodwill on the Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Statement of Income, to reduce the carrying value of AmeriGas Propane to its fair value. The Company calculated the deferred tax effect using the simultaneous equation method.\nThe performance of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit. If there is continued deterioration in the results of operations, a portion or all of the\nremaining recorded goodwill for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, which was $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, could be subject to further impairment.\nWith respect to UGI International's Fiscal 2023 goodwill impairment test, the Company bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment. Such assessment used a weighting of income and market approaches to determine fair value. With respect to the income approach, management used a discounted cash flow (DCF) method, using unobservable inputs. The significant assumptions in our DCF model include projected EBITDA, and a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs). With respect to the market approach, management used recent transaction market multiples for similar companies. Based on our evaluation, we determined that UGI Internationals fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. While the Company believes that its judgments used in the quantitative assessment of UGI Internationals fair value are reasonable based upon currently available facts and circumstances, if UGI International were not able to achieve its anticipated results and/or if its discount rate were to increase, its fair value would be adversely affected, which may result in an impairment. There is approximately $911 million of goodwill in this reporting unit as of September 30, 2023. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and related goodwill for any possible future non-cash impairment charges.\nAs of September 30, 2023, our goodwill totaled $3,027 million. Except for the previously mentioned impairment charge of $656 million at the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, no other impairments of goodwill were recognized in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. An impairment test for long-lived assets (or an asset group) is required when circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we perform a recoverability test based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the long-lived asset. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, we determine its fair value. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying amount, the long-lived asset is reduced to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such shortfall. When determining whether a long-lived asset has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows that are independent of other assets. Performing an impairment test on long-lived assets involves judgment in areas such as identifying when a triggering event requiring evaluation occurs; identifying and grouping assets; and, if the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, determining the fair value of the long-lived asset. Although cash flow estimates are based upon relevant information at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are by nature highly uncertain and contemplate factors that change over time such as the expected use of the asset including future production and sales volumes, expected fluctuations in prices of commodities and expected proceeds from disposition.\nThe impairment of AmeriGas Propanes goodwill during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was determined to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment analysis of AmeriGas Propanes long-lived and definite lived intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test of AmeriGas Propanes long-lived assets, including right-of-use (ROU) assets and definite lived intangible assets, as of May 31, 2023, using estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be generated over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group at the lowest level with identifiable cash flows that are independent of other assets. Based on the recoverability test performed, we determined that (1) AmeriGas Propanes long-lived assets, including ROU assets and definite lived intangible assets, were recoverable and, as such, no impairment charges were recorded; and (2) no adjustments to the remaining useful lives were necessary.\nNo material provisions for impairments of long-lived assets were recorded during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022.\nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Remediation Liabilities. We are involved in litigation that arises in the normal course of business, and we are subject to risk of loss for general, automobile and product liability and workers compensation claims for which we obtain insurance coverage subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. We are also subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effects of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current or former operating sites.\nWe establish reserves for loss contingencies including pending litigation, and for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general and product liability, automobile and workers compensation when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts related to such liability can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within a range of possible loss is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, liabilities recorded are based upon the low end of the range. With respect to unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents, we may use the work of specialists to estimate the ultimate losses to be incurred using actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data.\nThe likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular loss contingency is often difficult to predict. In addition, a reasonable estimate of the loss, or a range of possible loss, may not be practicable based upon the information available and the potential effects of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the loss contingency. Reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience. For litigation and pending claims including those covered by insurance policies, the analysis of probable loss is performed on a case by case basis and includes an evaluation of the nature of the claim, the procedural status of the matter, the probability or likelihood of success in prosecuting or defending the claim, the information available with respect to the claim, the opinions and views of outside counsel and other advisors, and past experience in similar matters. These judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received, and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary. Our estimated reserves for loss contingencies and for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general and product liability, automobile and workers compensation may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted.\nWe accrue reserves for environmental remediation when assessments indicate that it is probable a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent our best estimate of costs expected to be incurred or, if no best estimate can be made, the minimum liability associated with a range of expected environmental investigation and remediation costs. These estimates are based upon a number of factors including whether the company will be responsible for such remediation, the scope and cost of the remediation work to be performed, the portion of costs that will be shared with other potentially responsible parties, the timing of the remediation and possible impact of changes in technology, and the regulations and requirements of local governmental authorities. Our estimated reserves for environmental remediation may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted. PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with its in-state environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities. The accounting for our rate regulated gas and electric utility businesses differs from the accounting for nonregulated operations in that these businesses are required to reflect the effects of rate regulation in the consolidated financial statements. Regulatory practices that assign costs to accounting periods may differ from accounting methods generally applied by nonregulated businesses. When it is probable that regulators will permit the recovery of current costs through future rates charged to customers, these costs that otherwise would be expensed by nonregulated companies are deferred as regulatory assets. Similarly, regulatory liabilities are recognized when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have yet to be incurred. We continually assess whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by evaluating the regulatory environment, recent rate orders and public statements issued by the PAPUC, WVPSC and MDPSC, and discussions with regulatory authorities and legal counsel. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable, the elimination of those regulatory assets would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. As of September 30, 2023, our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities totaled $347 million and $366 million, respectively. For additional information on regulatory assets and liabilities, see Notes 2 and 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. We recognize the tax benefits from income tax positions that have a greater than more likely than not likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. A liability is recorded for uncertain tax positions where it is more likely than not the position may not be sustained based on its technical merits. We use assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes. We also use assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset. The interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty since tax authorities may interpret the laws differently. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax give consideration to current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. Changes in tax law or our interpretation thereof and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income taxes take into account estimates of the amount of future taxable income. Actual taxable income or future estimates of taxable income could render our current assumptions, judgments and estimates inaccurate. Changes in the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ significantly from our estimates. As of September 30, 2023, our net deferred tax liabilities totaled $871 million.\nBusiness Combination Purchase Price Allocations. From time to time, the Company enters into material business combinations. The purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. From time to time, we engage third-party\nvaluation experts to assist us in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to, discount rates and expected future cash flows from and the economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the acquisition date, under certain circumstances, as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the effects of recently issued accounting guidance. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk are contained in Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the caption Market Risk Disclosures and are incorporated by reference. ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included in Item 9A and the financial statements and financial statement schedules referred to in the Index contained on page of this Report are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n(a)The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company's management, with the participation of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2023, were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\n(b)Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management has conducted an assessment, including testing, of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).\nInternal control over financial reporting refers to the process, designed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts\nand expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to changing conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. This report is set forth below.\n(c)During the most recent fiscal quarter, no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of UGI Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited UGI Corporation and subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, UGI Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated November 28, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 28, 2023 ITEM 9B.

The consolidated financial statements and related information were prepared in accordance with GAAP and include amounts that are based on managements best judgments and estimates.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (the Committee) is composed of three members, each of whom is independent and a non-employee director of the Company. The Committee is responsible for monitoring and overseeing the financial reporting process, the adequacy of internal accounting controls, and the independence and performance of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors. The Committee meets regularly, with and without management present, with the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors, both of which report directly to the Committee. In addition, the Committee provides regular reports to the Board of Directors.\n/s/ Roger Perreault\nChief Executive Officer\n/s/ Sean P. OBrien\nChief Financial Officer\n/s/ Jean Felix Tematio Dontsop\nChief Accounting Officer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of UGI Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UGI Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated November 28, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of general liability, automobile and workers compensation reserves\nDescription of the Matter As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to risk of loss for general liability, automobile, and workers compensation claims for which it obtains coverage under insurance policies that are subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. The Company establishes reserves for pending and incurred but not reported claims associated with general liability, automobile, and workers compensation when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated.\nAuditing the Companys general liability, automobile, and workers compensation reserves was complex due to the significant measurement uncertainty associated with the estimate and the use of actuarial methods, including the Companys use of actuarial specialists. Specifically, the reserve estimate is sensitive to significant management assumptions, including the loss development factors for reported claims.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys valuation of general liability, automobile, and workers compensation reserves. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the calculations and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the reserves.\nTo test the valuation of general liability, automobile, and workers compensation reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to estimate the reserves and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, as well as inspecting the Companys insurance policies for coverage limits above which would be paid by the insurance carrier. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating the significant assumptions and actuarial methodologies used by the Company to estimate the total expected losses for claims. We also performed a search for unrecorded claims reserves related to claims incurred prior to the balance sheet date through examination of subsequent payments and other supporting documentation to determine if unrecorded claims affect the loss reserve estimation process or reserve balance.\nGoodwill Impairment Evaluation of the AmeriGas Propane and UGI International Reporting Units\nDescription of the Matter At September 30, 2023, the Companys goodwill balance was $3,027 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired. If goodwill is determined to be impaired, an impairment loss is measured at the amount by which the reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. During the interim period ended June 30, 2023, the Company identified interim impairment indicators related to goodwill within the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit. The Company performed a quantitative assessment of the reporting unit to determine its fair value. Based on the Companys evaluation, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656 million was recognized. Furthermore, as discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the fair value of the UGI International reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10% at September 30, 2023.\nAuditing the Companys goodwill impairment tests for the AmeriGas Propane and UGI International reporting units required especially challenging and complex judgment to evaluate the effects of macroeconomic and industry conditions such as future growth rates and discount rates and involved a high degree of subjectivity due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate of the reporting unit involves the use of significant unobservable inputs and is sensitive to changes in significant assumptions, such as the discount rate and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's goodwill impairment review and testing process which included the AmeriGas Propane and UGI International reporting units. For example, we tested controls over managements review of the valuation model, the significant assumptions described above, and the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the valuations.\nTo test the estimated fair value for the AmeriGas Propane and UGI International reporting units, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used to develop the estimated fair values, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry trends. We assessed the historical accuracy of managements estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting units that would result from changes in the assumptions. We also involved valuation specialists to assist in our evaluation of the overall methodologies and the discount rates used in the fair value estimate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2014.\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 28, 2023\nUGI CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Millions of dollars)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 241 $ 405\nRestricted cash 99 64\nAccounts receivable (less allowances for doubtful accounts of $71 and $64, respectively)\n878 1,127\nAccrued utility revenues 33 23\nIncome taxes receivable 36 128\nInventories 433 665\nDerivative instruments 75 865\nPrepaid expenses 123 110\nHeld for sale assets 13 295\nOther current assets 114 120\nTotal current assets 2,045 3,802\nProperty, plant and equipment\nNon-utility 7,046 6,656\nUtility 6,082 5,550\n13,128 12,206\nAccumulated depreciation (4,581) (4,166)\nNet property, plant, and equipment 8,547 8,040\nGoodwill 3,027 3,612\nIntangible assets, net 443 500\nUtility regulatory assets 302 301\nDerivative instruments 49 565\nOther assets 988 755\nTotal assets $ 15,401 $ 17,575\nLIABILITIES AND EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 57 $ 149\nShort-term borrowings 649 368\nAccounts payable 613 891\nEmployee compensation and benefits accrued 142 147\nDeposits and advances 232 225\nDerivative instruments 60 144\nHeld for sale liabilities 16 19\nOther current liabilities 505 501\nTotal current liabilities 2,274 2,444\nNoncurrent liabilities\nLong-term debt 6,543 6,483\nDeferred income taxes 928 1,305\nDerivative instruments 27 50\nOther noncurrent liabilities 1,235 1,219\nTotal liabilities 11,007 11,501\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 16)\nEquity:\nUGI Corporation stockholders equity:\nPreferred Stock, without par value (authorized 5,000,000 shares; issued 220,000 and 220,000 Series A shares, respectively)\n167 162\nUGI Common Stock, without par value (authorized -

Global LPG Business Transformation Initiatives\nNote 1 - Nature of Operations\nUGI is a holding company that, through subsidiaries and affiliates, distributes, stores, transports and markets energy products and related services. In the U.S., we own and operate (1) a retail propane marketing and distribution business; (2) natural gas and electric distribution utilities; and (3) energy marketing, midstream infrastructure, storage, natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas production, electricity generation and energy services businesses. In Europe, we market and distribute propane and other LPG, and market other energy products and services.\nWe conduct a domestic propane marketing and distribution business through AmeriGas Partners. AmeriGas Partners conducts its propane marketing and distribution business through its principal operating subsidiary AmeriGas OLP.\nUGI International, LLC, through its subsidiaries and affiliates, conducts (1) an LPG distribution business throughout much of Europe and (2) an energy marketing business in France and the Netherlands and, prior to its sales in Fiscal 2023, in Belgium and the United Kingdom. These businesses are conducted principally through our subsidiaries, UGI France, Flaga, AvantiGas, DVEP and UniverGas. See Note 5 for additional information regarding the UGI International energy marketing business.\nEnergy Services conducts, directly and through subsidiaries and affiliates, energy marketing, including RNG, midstream transmission, LNG storage, natural gas gathering and processing, natural gas and RNG production, electricity generation and energy services businesses primarily in the eastern region of the U.S., eastern Ohio, the panhandle of West Virginia and California. UGID owns electricity generation facilities principally located in Pennsylvania. Energy Services and its subsidiaries storage, LNG and portions of its midstream transmission operations are subject to regulation by the FERC.\nOur Utilities segment includes UGI Utilities and Mountaineer. PA Gas Utility serves customers in eastern and central Pennsylvania and in portions of one Maryland county, and Mountaineer serves customers in West Virginia. Electric Utility\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nserves customers in portions of Luzerne and Wyoming counties in northeastern Pennsylvania. PA Gas Utility is subject to regulation by the PAPUC and FERC and, with respect to its customers in Maryland, the MDPSC. Mountaineer is subject to regulation by the WVPSC and FERC. Electric Utility is subject to regulation by the PAPUC and FERC.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and costs. These estimates are based on managements knowledge of current events, historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may be different from these estimates and assumptions.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of UGI and its controlled subsidiary companies which are majority owned. We report outside ownership interests in other consolidated but less than 100%-owned subsidiaries, as noncontrolling interests. We eliminate intercompany accounts and transactions when we consolidate.\nWe account for privately held equity securities of entities without readily determinable fair values in which we do not have control, but have significant influence over operating and financial policies, under the equity method. See Note 21 for additional information on our equity method investments. Investments in equity securities related to entities in which we do not have significant influence over operating and financial policies are generally initially valued at their cost less impairment (if any) and subsequently remeasured at fair value, as applicable, in accordance with the relevant provisions under GAAP.\nEffects of Regulation\nCertain of our subsidiaries account for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980. In accordance with this guidance, incurred costs that would otherwise be charged to expense are capitalized and recorded as regulatory assets when it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered through rates in the future. Similarly, we recognize regulatory liabilities when it is probable that regulators will require customer refunds through future rates or when revenue is collected from customers for expenditures that have not yet been incurred. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to that item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date. Generally, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are amortized into expense and income over the periods authorized by the respective regulatory body. For additional information regarding the effects of rate regulation on our utility operations, see Note 9.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company applies fair value measurements on a recurring and, as otherwise required under ASC 820, on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurements performed on a recurring basis principally relate to derivative instruments and investments held in supplemental executive retirement plan grantor trusts.\nASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). A level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nWe use the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nsimilar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and inputs that are derived from observable market data by correlation or other means.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability including situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.\nFair value is based upon assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and risks inherent in valuation techniques and inputs to valuations. This includes not only the credit standing of counterparties and credit enhancements but also the impact of our own nonperformance risk on our liabilities. We evaluate the need for credit adjustments to our derivative instrument fair values. These credit adjustments were not material to the fair values of our derivative instruments.\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair values, unless the NPNS exception is elected. The accounting for changes in fair value depends upon the purpose of the derivative instrument, whether it is subject to regulatory ratemaking mechanisms or if it qualifies and is designated as a hedge for accounting purposes.\nCertain of our derivative instruments qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. For cash flow hedges, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recorded in AOCI, to the extent effective at offsetting changes in the hedged item, until earnings are affected by the hedged item. We discontinue cash flow hedge accounting if occurrence of the forecasted transaction is determined to be no longer probable. Hedge accounting is also discontinued for derivatives that cease to be highly effective. We do not designate our commodity and certain foreign currency derivative instruments as hedges under GAAP. Changes in the fair values of these derivative instruments are reflected in net income. Gains and losses on substantially all of the commodity derivative instruments used by Utilities are included in regulatory assets or liabilities because it is probable such gains or losses will be recoverable from, or refundable to, customers. From time to time, we also enter into net investment hedges. Gains and losses on net investment hedges that relate to our foreign operations are included in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI until such foreign net investment is substantially sold or liquidated.\nCash flows from derivative instruments, other than certain net investment hedges, are included in cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Cash flows from net investment hedges are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor a more detailed description of the derivative instruments we use, our accounting for derivatives, our objectives for using them and other information, see Note 18.\nBusiness Combination Purchase Price Allocations\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into material business combinations. The purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value as of the acquisition date with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information. Estimating fair values is generally subject to significant judgment, estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets. The allocation of the purchase price may be modified up to one year after the acquisition date, under certain circumstances, as more information is obtained about the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nForeign Currency Translation\nBalance sheets of international subsidiaries are translated into USD using the exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Income statements and equity investee results are translated into USD using an average exchange rate for each reporting period. Where the local currency is the functional currency, translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise with the impact of subsequent changes in such rates reflected in the income statement. The functional currency of a significant portion of our international operations is the euro.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nCertain revenues such as revenue from leases, financial instruments and other revenues are not within the scope of ASC 606 because they are not from contracts with customers. Such revenues are accounted for in accordance with other GAAP. Revenue-related taxes collected on behalf of customers and remitted to taxing authorities, principally sales and use taxes, are not included in revenues. Gross receipts taxes at Midstream & Marketing, Mountaineer and Electric Utility are presented on a gross basis. The Company has elected to use the practical expedient to expense the costs to obtain contracts when incurred for contracts that have a term less than one year. The costs incurred to obtain contracts that have durations of longer than one year are not material. See Note 4 for additional disclosures regarding the Companys revenue from contracts with customers.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. Provisions for uncollectible accounts are established based upon our collection experience, the assessment of the collectability of specific amounts and the Companys best estimate of current expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\nLPG Delivery Expenses\nExpenses associated with the delivery of LPG to customers of the Partnership and our UGI International operations (including vehicle expenses, expenses of delivery personnel, vehicle repair and maintenance and general liability expenses) are classified as Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Depreciation expense associated with the Partnership and UGI International delivery vehicles is classified in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIncome Taxes\nAmeriGas Partners and AmeriGas OLP are not directly subject to federal income taxes. Instead, their taxable income or loss is allocated to the individual partners. We record income taxes on (1) our share of the Partnerships current taxable income or loss and (2) the differences between the book and tax basis of our investment in the Partnership. AmeriGas OLP has subsidiaries which operate in corporate form and are directly subject to federal and state income taxes. Legislation in certain states allows for taxation of partnership income and the accompanying financial statements reflect state income taxes resulting from such legislation.\nUtilities records deferred income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income resulting from the use of accelerated tax depreciation methods based upon amounts recognized for ratemaking purposes. Utilities also records a deferred income tax liability for tax benefits, principally the result of accelerated tax depreciation for state income tax purposes, that are flowed through to ratepayers when temporary differences originate and records a regulatory income tax asset for the probable increase in future revenues that will result when the temporary differences reverse.\nWe are amortizing deferred investment tax credits related to UGI Utilities plant additions over the service lives of the related property. UGI Utilities reduces its deferred income tax liability for the future tax benefits that will occur when investment tax credits, which are not taxable, are amortized. We also reduce the regulatory income tax asset for the probable reduction in future revenues that will result when such deferred investment tax credits amortize. Investment tax credits associated with Midstream & Marketings qualifying renewable natural gas property under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 are reflected in income taxes.\nWe record interest on underpayments and overpayments of income taxes, and income tax penalties, in Income tax benefit (expense) on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest income or expense recognized was not material for all periods presented.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic earnings per share attributable to UGI Corporation stockholders reflect the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share attributable to UGI Corporation include the effects of dilutive stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units. Shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:\n(Thousands of shares) 2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for basic computation 209,806 209,940 209,063\nIncremental shares issuable for stock options, common stock awards and Equity Units (a) (b) - 5,881 3,063\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding for diluted computation 209,806 215,821 212,126\n(a)Includes the impact of common shares assumed to be outstanding under the if-converted method in connection with the May 2021 issuance of Equity Units (see Note 13).\n(b)For Fiscal 2023, 6,132 of such shares have been excluded as such incremental shares would be antidilutive due to the net loss for the period. For Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, 8,138 shares and 5,267 shares, respectively, associated with outstanding stock option awards were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash in banks and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. Restricted cash principally represents those cash balances in our commodity futures brokerage accounts that are restricted from withdrawal.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the corresponding amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n2023 2022 2021\nCash and cash equivalents $ 241 $ 405 $ 855\nRestricted cash 99 64 22\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 340 $ 469 $ 877\nInventories\nOur inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine cost using an average cost method for non-utility LPG and natural gas and utility inventories; specific identification for appliances; and the FIFO method for all other inventories.\nThe Company accounts for renewable energy certificates as inventory, which generally represents costs incurred to generate a certificate for sale. The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of renewable energy certificates when control of the certificate is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the certificate, if any, is then recorded within Cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Related Depreciation\nWe record property, plant and equipment at the lower of original cost or fair value, if impaired. Capitalized costs include labor, materials and other direct and indirect costs, and for certain operations subject to cost-of-service rate regulation, AFUDC. We also include in property, plant and equipment costs associated with computer software we develop or obtain for use in our businesses. The amounts assigned to property, plant and equipment of acquired businesses are based upon estimated fair value at date of acquisition. When we retire or otherwise dispose of non-utility plant and equipment, we eliminate the associated cost and accumulated depreciation and recognize any resulting gain or loss in \"Other operating income, net\" on the Consolidated Statements of Income. For property subject to cost of service rate regulation, upon retirement we charge the original cost to accumulated depreciation for financial accounting purposes. Costs incurred to retire UGI Utilities plant and equipment, net of salvage, are recorded in regulatory assets and amortized over five years, consistent with prior ratemaking treatment.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nWe record depreciation expense on non-utility plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over estimated economic useful lives. We record depreciation expense for Utilities plant and equipment on a straight-line basis based upon the projected service lives of the various classes of its depreciable property. We classify amortization of computer software and related IT system installation costs included in property, plant and equipment as depreciation expense. No depreciation expense is included in cost of sales on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nIntangible Assets. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives unless we determine their lives to be indefinite. Estimated useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets, primarily consisting of customer relationships. We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the associated carrying amounts may be impaired. Determining whether an impairment loss occurred requires comparing the carrying amount to the estimated fair value of the asset in accordance with ASC 820. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually (and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate that it is more likely than not that they are impaired) and written down to fair value, if impaired. See Note 12 for additional information related to intangible asset impairments recognized in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2021.\nGoodwill. We do not amortize goodwill, but test it at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment (a component) if it constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics. Each of our reporting units with goodwill is required to perform impairment tests annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill may be impaired.\nFor certain of our reporting units with goodwill, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. For our other reporting units with goodwill, we bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative assessment by comparing the fair values of the reporting units with their carrying amounts, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess but not to exceed the total amount of the goodwill of the reporting unit.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company identified interim impairment indicators at its AmeriGas Propane reporting unit and, as such, performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill as of May 31, 2023. Based on such impairment test, the Company recognized a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656. See Note 12 for additional information.\nWith respect to UGI International's Fiscal 2023 goodwill impairment test, the Company bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment. Such assessment used a weighting of income and market approaches to determine fair value. With respect to the income approach, management used a discounted cash flow (DCF) method, using unobservable inputs. The significant assumptions in our DCF model include projected EBITDA, and a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs). With respect to the market approach, management used recent transaction market multiples for similar companies. Based on our evaluation, we determined that UGI Internationals fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%. While the Company believes that its judgments used in the quantitative assessment of UGI Internationals fair value are reasonable based upon currently available facts and circumstances, if UGI International were not able to achieve its anticipated results and/or if its discount rate were to increase, its fair value would be adversely affected, which may result in an impairment. There is approximately $911 of goodwill in this reporting unit as of September 30, 2023. The Company will continue to monitor its reporting units and related goodwill for any possible future non-cash impairment charges.\nAccumulated goodwill impairment was $656 at September 30, 2023. There were no accumulated goodwill impairment losses at September 30, 2022. Except for the previously mentioned impairment charge of $656 at the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, there were no other impairments of goodwill recognized in all periods presented.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nImpairment testing for long-lived assets (or an asset group) is required when circumstances indicate that such assets may be impaired. If it is determined that a triggering event has occurred, we perform a recoverability test based upon estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the long-lived asset. If the undiscounted cash flows used in the recoverability test are less than the long-lived asset's carrying amount, we determine its fair value. If the fair value is determined to be less than its carrying amount, the long-lived asset is reduced to its estimated fair\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nvalue and an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such shortfall. When determining whether a long-lived asset has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has identifiable cash flows that are independent of other assets.\nThe impairment of AmeriGas Propanes goodwill during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, was determined to be a triggering event requiring an interim impairment analysis of AmeriGas Propanes long-lived and definite lived intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company performed a recoverability test of AmeriGas Propanes long-lived assets, including right-of-use (ROU) assets and definite lived intangible assets, as of May 31, 2023, using estimated undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be generated over the remaining useful life of the primary asset of the asset group at the lowest level with identifiable cash flows that are independent of other assets. Based on the recoverability test performed, we determined that (1) AmeriGas Propanes long-lived assets, including ROU assets and definite lived intangible assets, were recoverable and, as such, no impairment charges were recorded; and (2) no adjustments to the remaining useful lives were necessary.\nNo material provisions for impairments of long-lived assets were recorded for all periods presented.\nRefundable Tank and Cylinder Deposits\nIncluded in Other noncurrent liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets are customer paid deposits on tanks and cylinders primarily owned by subsidiaries of UGI France of $249 and $243 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Deposits are refundable to customers when the tanks or cylinders are returned in accordance with contract terms.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effects of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment. These laws and regulations require the removal or remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current or former operating sites.\nEnvironmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded as environmental liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represent our best estimate of costs expected to be incurred or, if no best estimate can be made, the minimum liability associated with a range of expected environmental investigation and remediation costs. These estimates are based upon a number of factors including whether the Company will be responsible for such remediation, the scope and cost of the remediation work to be performed, the portion of costs that will be shared with other potentially responsible parties, the timing of the remediation and possible impact of changes in technology, and the regulations and requirements of local governmental authorities. Our estimated liability for environmental contamination is reduced to reflect anticipated participation of other responsible parties but is not reduced for possible recovery from insurance carriers. Under GAAP, if the amount and timing of cash payments associated with environmental investigation and cleanup are reliably determinable, such liabilities are discounted to reflect the time value of money. We intend to pursue recovery of incurred costs through all appropriate means, including regulatory relief. PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with in-state environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. For further information, see Note 16.\nLoss Contingencies Subject to Insurance\nWe are subject to risk of loss for general, automobile and product liability, and workers compensation claims for which we obtain insurance coverage under insurance policies that are subject to self-insured retentions or deductibles. In accordance with GAAP, we record accruals when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated. When no amount within a range of possible loss is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, liabilities recorded are based upon the low end of the range. For litigation and pending claims including those covered by insurance policies, the analysis of probable loss is performed on a case by case basis and includes an evaluation of the nature of the claim, the procedural status of the matter, the probability or likelihood of success in prosecuting or defending the claim, the information available with respect to the claim, the opinions and views of outside counsel and other advisors, and past experience in similar matters. With respect to unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents, we may use the work of specialists to estimate the ultimate losses to be incurred using actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data. Our estimated reserves for loss contingencies may differ materially from the ultimate liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted. We maintain insurance coverage such that our net exposure for claims covered by insurance would be limited to the self-insured retentions or\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ndeductibles, claims above which would be paid by the insurance carrier. For such claims, we record a receivable related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by insurance.\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nWe use a market-related value of plan assets and an expected long-term rate of return to determine the expected return on assets of our U.S. pension and other postretirement plans. The market-related value of plan assets, other than equity investments, is based upon fair values. The market-related value of equity investments is calculated by rolling forward the prior-years market-related value with contributions, disbursements and the expected return on plan assets. One third of the difference between the expected and the actual value is then added to or subtracted from the expected value to determine the new market-related value (see Note 8).\nNote 3 - Accounting Changes\nNew Accounting Standard Adopted in Fiscal 2023\nDebt and Derivatives and Hedging. Effective October 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), using the modified retrospective approach. The amendments in this ASU affect entities that issue convertible instruments and/or contracts indexed to and potentially settled in an entitys own equity. This ASU reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, expands disclosure requirements for convertible instruments, and simplifies the related earnings per share guidance. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nUpon adoption, we reclassified $6 from Common Stock to Preferred Stock associated with the previously separated equity-classified beneficial conversion feature, which was accounted for as a deemed dividend. The increase to Preferred Stock was partially offset by an increase of $1 to opening retained earnings for the previously recognized non-cash amortization of the beneficial conversion feature. The ASU 2020-06 also removes the presumption of cash settlement for contracts that may be settled in cash or shares. In accordance with the new guidance, we included the dilutive impact of the quarterly contract adjustment payment liability associated with the 2024 Purchase Contracts, which may be settled in cash or shares, in our computation of weighted average diluted common shares outstanding. The adoption of the new guidance did not, and is not expected to, have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 4 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company generally has the right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer for performance completed to date. As such, we have elected to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice except in the case of certain of Utilities large delivery service customers and Midstream & Marketings peaking contracts for which we recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, consistent with when the performance obligations are satisfied by the Company.\nWe do not have a significant financing component in our contracts because we receive payment shortly before, at, or shortly after the transfer of control of the good or service. Because the period between the time the performance obligation is satisfied and payment is received is generally one year or less, the Company has elected to apply the significant financing component practical expedient and no amount of consideration has been allocated as a financing component.\nThe Companys revenues from contracts with customers are discussed below.\nUtility Revenues\nUtilities supplies natural gas and electricity and provides distribution services of natural gas and electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers who are generally billed at standard regulated tariff rates approved by the regulatory bodies through the ratemaking process. Tariff rates include a component that provides for a reasonable opportunity to recover\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\noperating costs and expenses and to earn a return on net investment, and a component that provides for the recovery, subject to reasonableness reviews, of PGC, PGA and DS costs.\nCustomers may choose to purchase their natural gas and electricity from Utilities, or, alternatively, may contract separately with alternate suppliers. Accordingly, our contracts with customers comprise two promised goods or services: (1) delivery service of natural gas and electricity through the Companys utility distribution systems and (2) the natural gas or electricity commodity itself for those customers who choose to purchase the natural gas or electricity directly from the Company. Revenue is not recorded for the sale of natural gas or electricity to customers who have contracted separately with alternate suppliers. For those customers who choose to purchase their natural gas or electricity from the Company, the performance obligation includes both the supply of the commodity and the delivery service.\nThe terms of our core market customer contracts are generally considered day-to-day as customers can discontinue service at any time without penalty. Performance obligations are generally satisfied over time as the natural gas or electricity is delivered to customers, at which point the customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the delivery service and, when applicable, the commodity. Amounts are billed to customers based upon the reading of a customers meter, which occurs on a cycle basis throughout each reporting period. An unbilled amount is recorded at the end of each reporting period based upon estimated amounts of natural gas or electricity delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading. These unbilled estimates consider various factors such as historical customer usage patterns, customer rates and weather.\nUtilities has certain fixed-term contracts with large commercial and industrial customers to provide natural gas delivery services at contracted rates and at volumes generally based on the customers needs. The performance obligation to provide the contracted delivery service for these large commercial and industrial customers is satisfied over time and revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis.\nUtilities makes off-system sales whereby natural gas delivered to our system in excess of amounts needed to fulfill our distribution system needs is sold to other customers, primarily other distributors of natural gas, based on an agreed-upon price and volume between the Company and the counterparty. Utilities also sells excess natural gas capacity whereby interstate pipeline capacity in excess of amounts needed to meet our customer obligations is sold to other distributors of natural gas based upon an agreed-upon rate. Off-system sales and capacity releases are generally entered into one month at a time and comprise the sale of a specific volume of gas or pipeline capacity at a specific delivery point or points over a specific time. As such, performance obligations associated with off-system sales and capacity release customers are satisfied, and associated revenue is recorded, when the agreed upon volume of natural gas is delivered or capacity is provided, and title is transferred, in accordance with the contract terms.\nElectric Utility provides transmission services to PJM by allowing PJM to access Electric Utilitys electricity transmission facilities. In exchange for providing access, PJM pays Electric Utility consideration determined by a formula-based rate approved by the FERC. The formula-based rate, which is updated annually, allows recovery of costs incurred to provide transmission services and return on transmission-related net investment. We recognize revenue over time as we provide transmission service.\nOther Utility revenues represent revenues from other ancillary services provided to customers and are generally recorded as the service is provided to customers.\nNon-Utility Revenues\nLPG. AmeriGas Propane and UGI International record revenue principally from the sale of LPG to retail and wholesale customers. The primary performance obligation associated with the sale of LPG is the delivery of LPG to (1) the customers point of delivery for retail customers and (2) the customers specified location where LPG is picked up by wholesale customers, at which point control of the LPG is transferred to the customer, the performance obligation is satisfied, and the associated revenue is recognized.\nContracts with customers comprise different types of contracts with varying length terms, fixed or variable prices, and fixed or variable quantities. Contracts with our residential customers, which comprise a substantial number of our customer contracts, are generally one year or less. Customer contracts for the sale of LPG include fixed-price, fixed-quantity contracts under which LPG is provided to customers at a fixed price and a fixed volume, and contracts that provide for the sale of LPG at market prices at date of delivery with no fixed volumes. AmeriGas Propane offers contracts that permit customers to lock in a fixed price for their volumes for a fee and also provide customers with the option to pre-buy a fixed amount of LPG at a fixed price.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nAmounts received under pre-buy arrangements are recorded as a contract liability when received and recorded as revenue when LPG is delivered and control is transferred to the customer. Fee revenue associated with fixed-price contracts are recorded as contract liabilities and recorded ratably over the contract period.\nAmeriGas Propane and UGI International also distribute LPG to customers in portable cylinders. Under certain contracts, filled cylinders are delivered, and control is transferred, to a reseller. In such instances, the reseller is our customer and we record revenue upon delivery to the reseller. Under other contracts, filled cylinders are delivered to a reseller, but the Company retains control of the cylinders. In such instances, we record revenue at the time the reseller transfers control of the cylinder to the end user.\nCertain retail LPG customers for AmeriGas Propane receive credits which we account for as variable consideration. We estimate these credits based upon past practices and historical customer experience and we reduce our revenues recognized for these credits.\nEnergy Marketing. Midstream & Marketing and UGI International operate energy marketing businesses that sell energy commodities, principally natural gas and electricity, to residential, commercial, industrial and wholesale customers. See Note 5 regarding recent transactions related to UGI Internationals energy marketing business.\nMidstream & Marketing and UGI International market natural gas and electricity on full-requirements or agreed-upon volume bases under contracts with varying length terms and at fixed or floating prices that are based on market indices adjusted for differences in price between the market location and delivery locations. Performance obligations associated with these contracts primarily comprise the delivery of the natural gas and electricity over a contractual period of time. Performance obligations also include other energy-related ancillary services provided to customers such as capacity. For performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time such as the delivery of natural gas, revenue is recorded when customers take control of the natural gas. Revenue is recorded for performance obligations that qualify as a series, when customers consume the natural gas or electricity is delivered, which corresponds to the amount invoiced to the customer. For transactions where the price or volume is not fixed, the transaction price is not determined until delivery occurs. The billed amount, and the revenue recorded, is based upon consumption by the customer.\nMidstream. Midstream & Marketing provides natural gas pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering, natural gas processing and natural gas underground storage services, which generally contain a performance obligation for the Company to have availability to transport or store a product. Additionally, the Company provides stand-ready services to sell supplemental energy products and related services, primarily LNG and propane-air mixtures during periods of high demand that typically result from cold weather. The Company also sells LNG to end-user customers for use by trucks, drilling rigs and other motored vehicles and equipment, and facilities that are located off the natural gas grid.\nContracts for natural gas transportation and gathering services are typically long-term contracts with terms of up to 30 years, while contracts for storage are typically for one-year or multiple storage season periods. Contracts to provide natural gas during periods of high demand have terms of up to 15 years. Contracts to sell LNG for trucks, drilling rigs and other motor vehicles and facilities are typically short-term (less than one year). Depending on the type of services provided or goods sold, midstream revenues may consist of demand rates, commodity rates, and transportation rates and may include other fees for ancillary services. Pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering and storage services provided and services to stand ready to sell supplemental energy products and services each are considered to have a single performance obligation satisfied through the passage of time ratably based upon providing a stand-ready service generally on a monthly basis. Contracts to sell LNG to end-user customers contain performance obligations to deliver LNG over the term of the contract and revenue is recognized at a point in time when the control of the energy products is transferred to the customer. The price in the contract corresponds to our efforts to satisfy the performance obligation and reflects the consideration we expect to receive for the satisfied performance obligation, and, therefore, the revenue is recognized based on the volume delivered and the price within the contract. In cases where shipping and handling occurs prior to the LNG being delivered to the customers storage vessel, we have elected to treat this as a cost of fulfillment and not a separate performance obligation. Revenues are typically billed and payment received monthly. Advance fees received from customers for stand-ready services are deferred as contract liabilities and revenue is recognized ratably over time as the performance obligation is satisfied over a period less than one year.\nElectricity Generation. Midstream & Marketing sells power generated from electricity generation assets in the wholesale electricity markets administered by PJM regional transmission organization. Power contracts with PJM consist of the sale of power, capacity and ancillary services, all of which are considered a bundle of various services. Performance obligations are satisfied over time, generally on a daily basis, as electricity is delivered to and simultaneously consumed by the customer. As\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nsuch, the Company has elected to recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice which is based on market prices at the time of the delivery of the electricity to the customers.\nOther. Other revenues from contracts with customers are generated primarily from AmeriGas Propanes parts and services business. The performance obligations of this business include installation and repair services. The performance obligations under these contracts are satisfied, and revenue is recognized, as control of the product is transferred or the services are rendered. Other LPG revenues from contracts with customers are generated primarily from certain fees AmeriGas Propane and UGI International charge associated with the delivery of LPG, including hazmat safety compliance, inspection, metering, installation, fuel recovery and certain other services. Revenues from fees are typically recorded when the LPG is delivered to the customer or the associated service is completed.\nRevenue Disaggregation\nThe following tables present our disaggregated revenues by reportable segment during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021:\n2023 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 1,020 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 1,020 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 413 - - - - 413 -\nLarge delivery service 177 - - - - 177 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 89 (73) - - - 162 -\nOther 43 (1) - - - 44 -\nTotal Utility 1,742 (74) - - - 1,816 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 3,952 - 2,184 1,768 - - -\nWholesale 325 - 118 207 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 2,139 (143) - 872 1,410 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 251 - - - 251 - -\nPeaking 31 (106) - - 137 - -\nOther 14 - - - 14 - -\nElectricity Generation 33 - - - 33 - -\nOther 274 - 194 80 - - -\nTotal Non-Utility 7,019 (249) 2,496 2,927 1,845 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 8,761 (323) 2,496 2,927 1,845 1,816 -\nOther revenues (b)(c) 167 (3) 85 38 2 38 7\nTotal revenues $ 8,928 $ (326) $ 2,581 $ 2,965 $ 1,847 $ 1,854 $ 7\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\n2022 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 875 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 875 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 365 - - - - 365 -\nLarge delivery service 171 - - - - 171 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 76 (104) - - - 180 -\nOther 23 (1) - - - 24 -\nTotal Utility 1,510 (105) - - - 1,615 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 4,436 - 2,439 1,997 - - -\nWholesale 496 - 218 278 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 2,951 (264) - 1,298 1,917 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 211 - - - 211 - -\nPeaking 48 (105) - - 153 - -\nOther 9 - - - 9 - -\nElectricity Generation 34 - - - 34 - -\nOther 286 - 207 79 - - -\nTotal Non-Utility 8,471 (369) 2,864 3,652 2,324 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 9,981 (474) 2,864 3,652 2,324 1,615 -\nOther revenues (b) 125 (3) 79 34 2 5 8\nTotal revenues $ 10,106 $ (477) $ 2,943 $ 3,686 $ 2,326 $ 1,620 $ 8\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\n2021 Total Eliminations\n(a) AmeriGas Propane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Corporate & Other\nRevenues from contracts with customers:\nUtility:\nCore Market:\nResidential $ 568 $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 568 $ -\nCommercial & Industrial 218 - - - - 218 -\nLarge delivery service 148 - - - - 148 -\nOff-system sales and capacity releases 51 (62) - - - 113 -\nOther 21 (2) - - - 23 -\nTotal Utility 1,006 (64) - - - 1,070 -\nNon-Utility:\nLPG:\nRetail 3,957 - 2,203 1,754 - - -\nWholesale 328 - 139 189 - - -\nEnergy Marketing 1,564 (126) - 605 1,085 - -\nMidstream:\nPipeline 181 - - - 181 - -\nPeaking 16 (98) - - 114 - -\nOther 8 - - - 8 - -\nElectricity Generation 13 - - - 13 - -\nOther 275 - 206 69 - - -\nTotal Non-Utility 6,342 (224) 2,548 2,617 1,401 - -\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers 7,348 (288) 2,548 2,617 1,401 1,070 -\nOther revenues (b) 99 (3) 66 34 5 9 (12)\nTotal revenues $ 7,447 $ (291) $ 2,614 $ 2,651 $ 1,406 $ 1,079 $ (12)\n(a)Includes intersegment revenues principally among Midstream & Marketing, Utilities and AmeriGas Propane.\n(b)Primarily represents revenues from tank rentals at AmeriGas Propane and UGI International, revenues from certain gathering assets at Midstream & Marketing, revenues from alternative revenue programs at Utilities and gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments not associated with current-period transactions reflected in Corporate & Other, none of which are within the scope of ASC 606 and are accounted for in accordance with other GAAP.\n(c)Includes the impact of the weather normalization adjustment rider, a five-year pilot program beginning on November 1, 2022 for PA Gas Utility. See Note 9 for additional information.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers or cash receipts. Contract assets represent our right to consideration after the performance obligations have been satisfied when such right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets were not material at September 30, 2023 and 2022. Substantially all of our receivables are unconditional rights to consideration and are included in Accounts receivable and, in the case of Utilities, Accrued utility revenues on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts billed are generally due within the following month.\nContract liabilities arise when payment from a customer is received before the performance obligations have been satisfied and represent the Companys obligations to transfer goods or services to a customer for which we have received consideration. The balances of contract liabilities were $158 and $164 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and are primarily included in Deposits and advances on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues recognized during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 from the amounts included in contract liabilities at September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 was $127, $119 and $138, respectively.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe Company excludes disclosures related to the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to certain performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period because these contracts have an initial expected term of one year or less, or we have a right to bill the customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value of services provided to the customer to date. Certain contracts with customers at Midstream & Marketing and Utilities contain minimum future performance obligations through 2047 and 2053, respectively. At September 30, 2023, Midstream & Marketing and Utilities expect to record approximately $2.2 billion and $0.2 billion of revenues, respectively, related to the minimum future performance obligations over the remaining terms of the related contracts.\nNote 5 - Acquisitions and Dispositions\nMountaineer Acquisition\nOn September 1, 2021, UGI completed the Mountaineer Acquisition in which UGI acquired all of the equity interests in Mountaineer, the largest natural gas distribution company in West Virginia, for a purchase price of $540, including the assumption of $140 principal amounts of long-term debt. The Mountaineer Acquisition was consummated pursuant to a purchase and sale agreement between UGI and the iCON Sellers and is consistent with our growth strategies, including expanding our core utility operations in the mid-Atlantic region. The Mountaineer Acquisition was funded with cash proceeds from the 2021 UGI Corporation Senior Credit Facility $215 term loan and cash on hand including proceeds from the issuance of Equity Units. Accounts associated with Mountaineer are included within our Utilities reportable segment. The Company has accounted for the Mountaineer Acquisition using the acquisition method.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe components of the Mountaineer purchase accounting are as follows:\nAssets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 3\nAccounts receivable 14\nInventories 41\nOther current assets 21\nProperty, plant and equipment 397\nOther noncurrent assets 48\nTotal assets acquired $ 524\nLiabilities assumed:\nShort-term borrowings $ 55\nAccounts payable 20\nOther current liabilities 52\nLong-term debt 164\nPension and other postretirement benefit obligation 33\nDeferred income taxes 21\nOther noncurrent liabilities 29\nTotal liabilities assumed $ 374\nGoodwill 250\nNet consideration transferred $ 400\nMountaineer is a regulated entity which accounts for the financial effects of regulation in accordance with ASC 980. The effects of regulation can impact the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired, and as such, the measurement of the fair value of regulated property assets using the predecessors carrying value is generally accepted since regulation attaches to the assets and regulation is so pervasive that the regulation extends to the individual assets. In certain other instances where assets or liabilities are subject to rate recovery, we recorded fair value adjustments to such assets and liabilities as regulatory assets and liabilities.\nThe excess of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has been reflected as goodwill, assigned to the Utilities reportable segment. Goodwill is attributable to the assembled workforce of Mountaineer, planned customer growth and planned growth in rate base through continued investment in utility infrastructure. The goodwill recognized from the Mountaineer Acquisition is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe Company recognized $13 of direct transaction-related costs associated with the Mountaineer Acquisition during Fiscal 2021, which costs are reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the 2021 Consolidated Statement of Income. The Mountaineer Acquisition did not have a material impact on the Companys revenues or net income attributable to UGI for Fiscal 2021. In addition, the impact of the Mountaineer Acquisition on a pro forma basis as if the Mountaineer Acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2019 was not material to the Companys revenues or net income for Fiscal 2021.\nAcquisitions of Assets\nPennant. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, Energy Services completed the Pennant Acquisition and acquired the remaining 53% of the equity interests in Pennant for total cash consideration of approximately $61. The Pennant Acquisition was funded using available cash. The acquisition of the remaining interests has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets,\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nand the purchase price has been primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. See Note 21 for additional information related to the acquired interest in Pennant.\nStonehenge. In January 2022, Energy Services completed the Stonehenge Acquisition and acquired all of the equity interests in Stonehenge for total cash consideration of approximately $190. The Stonehenge business includes a natural gas gathering system, located in western Pennsylvania, with more than 47 miles of pipeline and associated compression assets. The Stonehenge Acquisition is consistent with our growth strategies, including expanding our midstream natural gas gathering assets within the Appalachian basin production region. The Stonehenge Acquisition was funded using available cash. This transaction has been accounted for as an acquisition of assets, and the purchase price has been primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. We refer to Stonehenge and its assets as UGI Moraine East.\nDispositions\nUGI International Energy Marketing Transactions\nDuring Fiscal 2023 and in October 2023, the Company entered into a number of transactions pursuant to its previously announced decision to exit its European energy marketing business. The European energy marketing business primarily markets natural gas and electricity to customers through third-party distribution systems in France, the Netherlands and, prior to its sales, in Belgium and the United Kingdom.\nFrance. In October 2023, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold substantially all of its energy marketing business located in France for a net cash payment to the buyer of $25 (which approximates a pre-tax loss), subject to certain adjustments principally related to the pending transfer of certain customer contracts. As of September 30, 2023, the $25 cash to be paid to the buyer in October 2023 had been placed in escrow and is reflected in Other current assets on the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The carrying values of the assets and liabilities associated with this business, principally comprising certain commodity derivative instruments, energy certificates and certain working capital, have been classified as held-for-sale on the September 30, 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not recognize any impairment associated with the assets held for sale in Fiscal 2023 because, in accordance with our policy related to such assets, any impairment is limited to the disposal groups long-lived assets, and such assets were not material.\nBelgium. In September 2023, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its energy marketing business located in Belgium for a net cash payment to the buyer of $3. Pursuant to the sale agreement, the Company transferred to the buyer certain assets, principally comprising customer and energy broker contracts. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $6 ($5 after-tax) which amount includes the net payment to the buyer, the write-off of certain prepaid energy broker payments and associated transaction costs and fees.

In October 2022, UGI International, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, sold its natural gas marketing business located in the U.K. for a net cash payment to the buyer of $19 which includes certain working capital adjustments. In conjunction with the sale, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $215 ($151 after-tax) substantially all of which loss was due to the non-cash transfer of commodity derivative instruments associated with the business. The loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of UGI International energy marketing business on the Consolidated Statements of Income. At the date of closing of the sale, these commodity derivative instruments had a net carrying value of $206 which is attributable to net unrealized gains on such instruments. At September 30, 2022, these derivative instruments were classified as held-for-sale assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and had a net carrying value of $276. The change in the carrying value of these derivative instruments between September 30, 2022 and October 21, 2022 resulted from changes in their fair values during that period.\nNetherlands. In September 2023, a substantial number of DVEPs customers agreed to modify their energy marketing contracts whereby the Company will continue to provide for the delivery of electricity and natural gas at fixed prices through December 31, 2023, but the Companys obligations to provide future services will be terminated effective January 1, 2024. As consideration for the early termination of such contracts, the Company has agreed to make cash payments to the customers equal to the fair values of specific commodity derivative instruments associated with periods after December 31, 2023. The carrying values of these commodity derivative instruments are subject to change until such contracts are settled, and the cash payments are made during the first quarter of Fiscal 2024. At September 30, 2023, the carrying value of these commodity derivative instruments was $44. The early termination agreements with DVEP customers are considered contract modifications and the cash consideration to be paid to these customers has been, and will be reflected as a reduction in revenues, on a pro-rata\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nbasis, over the remaining performance period of such agreements through December 31, 2023. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company reduced its revenues from these customers by $4, which represents the pro-rated performance obligation through September 30, 2023 from the aforementioned $44.\nIn conjunction with the wind-down of its European energy marketing business, in July 2023, DVEP agreed to sell a substantial portion of its power purchase agreements to a third party for a cash payment to the buyer of $6.

These agreements contain standard provisions which require compliance with certain financial ratios. Certain of the subsidiaries nonrecourse debt agreements contain cross-default provisions, whereby default under an agreement with one lender simultaneously causes default under agreements with other lenders. In addition, under the default provisions, a default of a subsidiary results in or is at risk of triggering a cross-default under the debt of the parent company. UGI and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2023.\n2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. Under the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, AmeriGas OLP, as borrower, is required to comply with financial covenants related to leverage and interest coverage measured at the Partnership and at AmeriGas OLP. On November 15 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement, which amends certain provisions of the credit agreement dated as of September 28, 2022 to, among other things, (i) reduce the maximum revolver amount from $600 to $400, (ii) reduce the minimum interest coverage ratio, effective for the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 through the end of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2024 and (iii) beginning for the first quarter of Fiscal 2025, the minimum interest coverage ratio will remain reduced if the net leverage ratio is below a threshold as defined by the agreement; if the net leverage ratio exceeds such threshold, the minimum interest coverage ratio will revert to the original ratio as defined by the agreement.\nAs of March 31, 2023, AmeriGas OLP was in breach of the leverage ratio debt covenant and interest coverage ratio, which it cured with the funds received from UGI. The 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement contains an equity cure provision, which allows AmeriGas OLPs direct or indirect parent, including UGI and its other subsidiaries, to fund capital contributions to eliminate any EBITDA (as defined in the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement) shortfalls that would otherwise result in non-compliance with these financial covenants. UGI made capital contributions to AmeriGas OLP of $20 and $11 on March 31, 2023 and April 24, 2023, respectively, which in aggregate represented one equity cure in accordance with the 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement. As a result of these capital contributions, AmeriGas OLP and the Partnership were in compliance with its financial covenants after considering the equity cure provision as of June 30, 2023 and March 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Partnership was in compliance with all debt covenants as set forth in the amended 2022 AmeriGas OLP Credit Agreement without the consideration of the equity cure provision.\nUGI also provided an irrevocable letter of support whereby UGI has committed to fund any such EBITDA shortfalls and debt service, if any. Based on the support and the projected EBITDA, AmeriGas OLP is expected to remain in compliance with its financial debt covenants for the succeeding twelve-month period. In addition, in May 2023, the Company contributed $52 in an equity contribution principally to fund debt service on the senior notes.\nRestricted Net Assets\nAt September 30, 2023, the amount of net assets of UGIs consolidated subsidiaries that were restricted from transfer to UGI under debt agreements, subsidiary partnership agreements and regulatory requirements under foreign laws totaled approximately $3,600.\nNote 7 - Income Taxes\n(Loss) income before income taxes comprises the following:\n2023 2022 2021\nDomestic $ (346) $ 362 $ 647\nForeign (1,491) 1,025 1,342\nTotal (loss) income before income taxes $ (1,837) $ 1,387 $ 1,989\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe provisions for income taxes consist of the following:\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent expense (benefit):\nFederal $ (1) $ 24 $ (48)\nState 37 18 7\nForeign 49 50 85\nTotal current expense 85 92 44\nDeferred expense (benefit):\nFederal 34 45 168\nState (21) (17) 48\nForeign (433) 193 262\nTotal deferred (benefit) expense (420) 221 478\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense $ (335) $ 313 $ 522\nFederal income taxes for Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 are net of foreign tax credits of $25 and $5, respectively. There were no foreign tax credits utilized in Fiscal 2021.\nA reconciliation from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nDifference in tax rate due to:\nGoodwill impairment not deductible for tax (7.3) - -\nEffects of foreign operations 3.9 4.4 4.6\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (1.1) 1.5 1.9\nValuation allowance adjustments 1.1 (0.5) 1.0\nEffects of tax rate changes - State, net of federal benefit 0.2 (1.4) -\nEffects of tax rate changes - International - (2.3) (1.3)\nEffects of U.S. tax legislation - - (0.8)\nOther, net 0.4 (0.1) (0.2)\nEffective tax rate 18.2 % 22.6 % 26.2 %\nIn July 2022, tax legislation was enacted in Pennsylvania reducing the states corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 4.99% over a nine-year period, beginning with an initial reduction to 8.99% beginning in Fiscal 2024. The legislation resulted in $4 and $20 of tax benefits being recorded in Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, respectively, based on the Companys analysis of future reversals of net deferred tax liabilities.\nIn February 2021, tax legislation was enacted in Italy which allowed the Company to align book basis with tax basis on certain assets in exchange for paying a three percent substitute tax payment payable in three annual installments. This election resulted in a $23 net benefit in Fiscal 2021. Timing of the recovery of the resulting incremental tax basis was changed with legislation in Fiscal 2022 extending the deductible period of recovery from 18 to 50 years.\nOn March 27, 2020 the CARES Act was enacted into law. The primary impact of the legislation was the change in federal net operating loss carryback rules which allowed the Companys U.S. federal tax losses generated in Fiscal 2021 to be carried back to Fiscal 2016. The carryback of our Fiscal 2021 U.S. federal tax losses from a 21% rate environment to offset taxable income in Fiscal 2016 in a 35% rate environment generated incremental benefits of $15. A $37 refund claim for the Fiscal 2021 claim has been filed and is included in Income taxes receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nOur effective tax rate is subject to the impact of changes to the taxation of foreign source income made by the TCJA and the high tax exception regulations issued in July 2020. Income tax expense for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 includes $13, $3, and $8, respectively, of GILTI taxes that are treated as current period costs and carry no related deferred taxes.\nPennsylvania and West Virginia utility ratemaking practices permit the flow through to ratepayers of state tax benefits resulting from accelerated tax depreciation. For Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, the beneficial effects of state tax flow through of accelerated depreciation reduced income tax expense by $11, $10, and $9, respectively.\nDeferred tax liabilities (assets) comprise the following at September 30:\n2023 2022\nExcess book basis over tax basis of property, plant and equipment $ 966 $ 867\nUtility regulatory assets 84 106\nIntangible assets and goodwill 81 75\nDerivative instrument assets 19 514\nOther 37 33\nGross deferred tax liabilities 1,187 1,595\nInvestment in AmeriGas Partners (28) (79)\nPension plan liabilities (14) (21)\nEmployee-related benefits (37) (38)\nOperating loss carryforwards (75) (48)\nForeign tax credit carryforwards (64) (76)\nUtility regulatory liabilities (83) (85)\nUtility environmental liabilities (15) (15)\nInterest expense (83) (51)\nOther (58) (74)\nGross deferred tax assets (457) (487)\nDeferred tax assets valuation allowance 141 141\nNet deferred tax liabilities $ 871 $ 1,249\nAt September 30, 2023, we carried foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $6 relating to Flaga, $23 at certain subsidiaries of UGI France, $10 relating to Belgium, $5 relating to U.K., and $44 in the Netherlands with no expiration dates. We have state net operating loss carryforwards primarily relating to certain subsidiaries that approximate $1,071 and expire through 2043. We also have federal operating loss carryforwards of $9 for certain operations of AmeriGas Propane. At September 30, 2023, deferred tax assets relating to operating loss carryforwards amounted to $75 related to various UGI subsidiaries.\nValuation allowances against deferred tax assets exist for foreign tax credit carryforwards, net operating loss carryforwards of foreign subsidiaries, capital loss carryforwards and a notional interest deduction. The valuation allowance for all deferred tax remained the same in Fiscal 2023, which included an increase of $19 for disallowed interest, an increase of $11 for foreign net operating losses, $5 for a notional interest deduction and $3 from state tax rate decreases were offset by $22 decrease against capital losses and a $16 decrease against FTCs.\nThe valuation allowance for all deferred tax assets increased by $3 in Fiscal 2022, which included a $17 increase in a notional interest deduction carryover, offset by a release of $6 against FTCs that will be realizable in the future, a $4 decrease from state tax rate changes, and a $4 decrease related to foreign net operating loss carry forwards.\nWe conduct business and file tax returns in the U.S., and various local, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our U.S. federal income tax returns are settled through the 2019 tax year, and our European tax returns are effectively settled for various years from 2015 to 2020. State and other income tax returns in the U.S. are generally subject to examination for a period of three to five years after the filing of the respective returns.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe Companys unrecognized tax benefits including amounts related to accrued interest, which if subsequently recognized would be recorded as a benefit to income taxes, amounted to $26, $5, and $3 at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Generally, a net reduction in unrecognized tax benefits could occur because of the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions or as a result of settlements with tax authorities. The expected change in unrecognized tax benefits and related interest in the next twelve months as the result of the expiration of certain statutes is immaterial.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits - beginning of year $ 5 $ 3 $ 4\nAdditions for tax positions of the current year 3 2 -\nDecreases for tax positions taken in prior years - - (2)\nIncreases for tax positions taken in prior years 19 1 1\nSettlements with tax authorities/statute lapses (1) (1) -\nUnrecognized tax benefits - end of year $ 26 $ 5 $ 3\nNote 8 - Employee Retirement Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans\nThe U.S. Pension Plans consist of (1) a defined benefit pension plan for employees hired prior to January 1, 2009, of UGI, UGI Utilities, and certain of UGIs other domestic wholly owned subsidiaries and (2) a defined benefit pension plan for Mountaineer employees hired prior to January 1, 2023. U.S. Pension Plans benefits are based on years of service, age and employee compensation. In addition, certain UGI International employees in France and Belgium are covered by defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. Although the disclosures in the tables below include amounts related to the UGI International plans, such amounts are not material.\nWe also provide postretirement health care benefits to certain retirees and postretirement life insurance benefits to certain U.S. active and retired employees. The ABO of our other postretirement benefit plans was $21 and $22 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The fair value of the plan assets of our other postretirement benefit plans was $18 and $16 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the PBOs of our pension plans (the U.S. Pension Plans and the UGI International pension plans), plan assets, and the related funded status of our pension plans as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. ABO is the present value of benefits earned to date with benefits based upon current compensation levels. PBO is ABO increased to reflect estimated future compensation.\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nChange in benefit obligations:\nBenefit obligations - beginning of year $ 633 $ 870\nService cost 9 16\nInterest cost 35 26\nActuarial gain (20) (240)\nPlan amendments - 1\nForeign currency 2 (6)\nBenefits paid (36) (34)\nBenefit obligations - end of year (a) $ 623 $ 633\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets - beginning of year $ 541 $ 736\nActual gain (loss) on plan assets 31 (173)\nForeign currency 1 (3)\nEmployer contributions 19 15\nBenefits paid (36) (34)\nFair value of plan assets - end of year $ 556 $ 541\nFunded status of the plans - end of year (b) $ (67) $ (92)\nAmounts recorded in UGI Corporation stockholders equity (pre-tax):\nPrior service cost $ 3 $ 3\nNet actuarial gain (17) (17)\nTotal $ (14) $ (14)\nAmounts recorded in regulatory assets and liabilities (pre-tax):\nNet actuarial loss 110 114\nTotal $ 110 $ 114\n(a) The ABO for the U.S. Pension Plans was $558 and $570 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b) Amounts are reflected in Other noncurrent liabilities and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts reflected in Other assets are not material.\nIn Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the change in the pension plans PBO due to actuarial gains is principally the result of changes in discount rates.\nActuarial assumptions for our U.S. Pension Plans are described below. The discount rate assumption was determined by selecting a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds appropriate to provide for the projected benefit payments of the plans. The discount rate was then developed as the single rate that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans benefit payments. The expected rate of return on assets assumption is based on current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets (as further described below).\nPension Plans\n2023 2022 2021\nWeighted-average assumptions:\nDiscount rate - benefit obligations 6.09 % 5.70 % 3.13 %\nDiscount rate - benefit cost\n5.70 % 3.13 % 2.90 %\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.50 % 7.10 % 7.10 %\nRate of increase in salary levels\n3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 %\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe service cost component of our pension and other postretirement plans, net of amounts capitalized, is reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The non-service cost components, net of amounts capitalized by Utilities as a regulatory asset, are reflected in Other non-operating (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income. Other postretirement benefit cost was not material for all periods presented. Net periodic pension (income) cost includes the following components:\nPension Benefits\n2023 2022 2021\nService cost $ 9 $ 16 $ 12\nInterest cost 35 26 22\nExpected return on assets (45) (50) (40)\nAmortization of:\nActuarial (gain) loss (3) 7 14\nNet benefit (income) cost $ (4) $ (1) $ 8\nIt is our general policy to fund amounts for U.S. Pension Plans benefits equal to at least the minimum required contribution set forth in applicable employee benefit laws. From time to time, we may, at our discretion, contribute additional amounts. During Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we made cash contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans of $18, $14 and $13, respectively. The minimum required contributions to the U.S. Pension Plans in Fiscal 2024 is $22.\nUGI Utilities has established a VEBA trust to pay certain retiree health care and life insurance benefits by depositing into the VEBA the annual amount of postretirement benefits costs, if any. Assets associated with the VEBA are not material and we do not expect to be required to make any contributions to the VEBA during Fiscal 2024.\nExpected payments for postretirement benefits over the next 10 years are not material. Expected payments for pension benefits are as follows:\nPension\nBenefits\nFiscal 2024 $ 39\nFiscal 2025 $ 39\nFiscal 2026 $ 41\nFiscal 2027 $ 43\nFiscal 2028 $ 44\nFiscal 2029 - 2033 $ 238\nWe also sponsor unfunded and non-qualified supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the PBOs of these plans, including obligations for amounts held in grantor trusts, totaled $34 and $44, respectively. Costs associated with these plans and amounts recorded in UGIs stockholders equity representing actuarial gains and losses were not material for all periods presented and are excluded from the tables above. During Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022, the payments the Company made with respect to the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans were not material. During Fiscal 2021, the Company made $12 of payments for the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans. The total fair value of the grantor trust investment assets associated with the supplemental executive defined benefit retirement plans, which are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $26 and $31 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nU.S. Pension Plans Assets\nThe assets of the U.S. Pension Plans are held in trust. The investment policies and asset allocation strategies for the assets in these trusts are determined by the Retirement Plan Committee comprising certain members of UGIs senior management. The overall investment objective is to minimize projected funded status volatility by more closely aligning the duration of the U.S. Pension Plans fixed income portfolio to the duration of its liabilities. The proportion of plan assets allocated to fixed income investments will increase as the funded status increases. Investments are made principally in common collective trust funds that\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nconsist of equity index investments, bond index investments and short-term investments, and, to a much less extent, UGI Common Stock.\nThe targets and actual allocations for the U.S. Pension Plans trust assets at September 30 are as follows:\nActual Target Asset Allocation (b)\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nEquity investments:\nU.S. equities 25.8 % 26.5 % 27.6 % 24.7 %\nNon-U.S. equities 21.7 % 20.9 % 23.3 % 20.9 %\nGlobal equities (a) 13.9 % 13.8 % 10.7 % 13.1 %\nTotal 61.4 % 61.2 % 61.6 % 58.7 %\nFixed income funds & cash equivalents 35.5 % 35.5 % 35.0 % 35.0 %\nAlternative investments 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.4 % 6.3 %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\n(a) Comprises investment funds that consist of a mix of U.S. and Non-U.S. equity securities.\n(b) There is a permitted range for the allocation of the trust assets for the U.S. Pension Plans, excluding the defined benefit pension plan for Mountaineer employees, which is 5% less than and greater than the target allocation.\nCommon collective trust funds in the U.S. Pension Plans primarily include investments in U.S., Non-U.S. and global (a mix of U.S. and Non-U.S.) equities, fixed income and short-term investments. The fair values of common collective trust funds and cash equivalents are valued at the NAV of units of the collective trusts. The NAVs, as provided by the trustee, are used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value based on the fair values of the underlying investments held by the funds less their liabilities. The fair values of the U.S. Pension Plans trust assets by asset class as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2023 2022\nU.S. Pension Plans:\nDomestic equity investments:\nUGI Corporation Common Stock $ 19 $ 26\nTotal domestic equity investments (a) 19 26\nCommon collective trust funds:\nU.S. equity index investments 120 113\nNon-U.S. equity index investments 117 110\nGlobal equity index investments 75 72\nBond index investments 183 177\nCash equivalents 8 10\nTotal common collective trust funds (b) 503 482\nAlternative investments (b) 17 17\nTotal $ 539 $ 525\n(a) Level 1 investments within the fair value hierarchy.\n(b) Assets measured at NAV and therefore excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\nThe expected long-term rates of return on U.S. Pension Plans trust assets have been developed using a best estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. The estimates are based on historical capital market performance data and future expectations provided by independent consultants. Future expectations are determined by using simulations that provide a wide range of scenarios of future market performance. The market conditions in these simulations consider the long-term relationships between equities and fixed income as well as current market conditions at the start of the\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nsimulation. The expected rate begins with a risk-free rate of return with other factors being added such as inflation, duration, credit spreads and equity risk premiums. The rates of return derived from this process are applied to our target asset allocation to develop a reasonable return assumption.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor 401(k) savings plans for eligible employees of UGI and certain of UGIs domestic subsidiaries. Generally, participants in these plans may contribute a portion of their compensation on either a before-tax basis, or on both a before-tax and after-tax basis. These plans also provide for employer matching contributions at various rates. The cost of benefits under the savings plans totaled $22 in Fiscal 2023, $21 in Fiscal 2022 and $21 in Fiscal 2021. The Company also sponsors certain nonqualified supplemental defined contribution executive retirement plans. These plans generally provide supplemental benefits to certain executives that would otherwise be provided under retirement plans but are prohibited due to limitations imposed by the IRC. The Company makes payments to self-directed grantor trusts with respect to these supplemental defined contribution plans. Such payments during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 were not material. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the total fair values of these grantor trust investment assets, which amounts are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, were $9 and $7, respectively.\nNote 9 - Utility Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Regulatory Matters\nThe following regulatory assets and liabilities associated with our Utilities reportable segment are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30:\n2023 2022\nRegulatory assets (a):\nIncome taxes recoverable $ 94 $ 83\nUnderfunded pension plans 111 114\nEnvironmental costs 28 37\nDeferred fuel and power costs 27 32\nRemoval costs, net 23 22\nOther 64 52\nTotal regulatory assets $ 347 $ 340\nRegulatory liabilities (a):\nPostretirement benefits $ 12 $ 11\nDeferred fuel and power refunds 55 3\nState income tax benefits - distribution system repairs 43 38\nExcess federal deferred income taxes 254 279\nOther 2 4\nTotal regulatory liabilities $ 366 $ 335\n(a) Current regulatory assets are recorded in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory liabilities are recorded in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther than removal costs, Utilities currently does not recover a rate of return on the regulatory assets included in the table above.\nIncome taxes recoverable. This regulatory asset is the result of recording deferred tax liabilities pertaining to temporary tax differences principally as a result of the pass through to ratepayers of the tax benefit on accelerated tax depreciation for state income tax purposes, and the flow through of accelerated tax depreciation for federal income tax purposes for certain years prior to 1981. These deferred taxes have been reduced by deferred tax assets pertaining to utility deferred investment tax credits. Utilities has recorded regulatory income tax assets related to these deferred tax liabilities representing future revenues recoverable through the ratemaking process over the average remaining depreciable lives of the associated property ranging from 1 to approximately 65 years.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nUnderfunded pension plans. This regulatory asset represents the portion of net actuarial losses and prior service costs (credits) associated with Gas Utility and Electric Utility pension benefits which are probable of being recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. These regulatory assets are adjusted annually or more frequently under certain circumstances when the funded status of the plans is remeasured in accordance with GAAP. These costs are amortized over the average remaining future service lives of plan participants.\nEnvironmental costs. Environmental costs principally represent estimated probable future environmental remediation and investigation costs that PA Gas Utility expects to incur, primarily at MGP sites in Pennsylvania, in conjunction with a remediation COA with the PADEP. Pursuant to base rate orders, PA Gas Utility receives ratemaking recognition of its estimated environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with its environmental sites. This ratemaking recognition balances the accumulated difference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. The period over which PA Gas Utility expects to recover these costs will depend upon future remediation activity. For additional information on environmental costs, see Note 16.\nRemoval costs, net. This regulatory asset represents costs incurred, net of salvage, associated with the retirement of depreciable utility plant of UGI Utilities. As required by PAPUC ratemaking, removal costs include actual costs incurred associated with asset retirement obligations. Consistent with prior ratemaking treatment, UGI Utilities expects to recover these costs over five years.\nPostretirement benefits. This regulatory liability represents the difference between amounts recovered through rates by PA Gas Utility and Electric Utility and actual costs incurred in accordance with accounting for postretirement benefits. A portion of this liability will be refunded to customers over the average remaining future service lives of plan participants. Another portion of this liability represents overcollections for which refund periods have been established within ratemaking proceedings. With respect to Gas Utility, postretirement benefit overcollections are generally being refunded to customers over a ten-year period beginning October 19, 2016. With respect to Electric Utility, the overcollections are being refunded to ratepayers over a 20-year period effective October 27, 2018.\nDeferred fuel and power - costs and refunds. Utilities tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred purchased gas and power costs through the application of PGC rates, PGA rates and DS tariffs. These clauses provide for periodic adjustments to PGC, PGA and DS rates for differences between the total amount of purchased gas and electric generation supply costs collected from customers and recoverable costs incurred. Net undercollected costs are classified as a regulatory asset and net overcollections are classified as a regulatory liability.\nThe WVPSC, in an effort to mitigate the impact of WV Gas Utilitys 2022 PGA rate increase to customers, delayed the effective date in 2022 from November 1 to December 1 and deferred $12 of unrecovered gas costs in determining the rates to be charged to the various customer classes effective December 1, 2022. Additionally, in order to lower winter bills for residential customers, the WVPSC removed transportation and storage costs from the volumetric rate and created a fixed monthly pipeline demand charge applicable only to residential customers. On April 12, 2023, the WVPSC issued a final order that increased the PGA rate, which included the unrecovered gas cost balance initially deferred in the interim order, and continued the fixed monthly demand charge for residential customers.\nPA Gas Utility uses derivative instruments to reduce volatility in the cost of gas it purchases for retail core-market customers. Realized and unrealized gains or losses on natural gas derivative instruments are included in deferred fuel and power costs or refunds. Net unrealized (losses) gains on such contracts at September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $(2) and $5, respectively.\nState income tax benefits - distribution system repairs. This regulatory liability represents Pennsylvania state income tax benefits, net of federal benefit, resulting from the deduction for income tax purposes of repair and maintenance costs associated with UGI Utilities assets that are capitalized for regulatory and GAAP reporting. The tax benefits associated with these repair and maintenance deductions will be reflected as a reduction to income tax expense over the remaining tax lives of the related book assets.\nExcess federal deferred income taxes. This regulatory liability is the result of remeasuring Utilities federal deferred income tax liabilities on utility plant due to the enactment of the TCJA on December 22, 2017. In order for our utility assets to continue to be eligible for accelerated tax depreciation, current law requires that excess federal deferred income taxes resulting from the remeasurement be amortized no more rapidly than over the remaining lives of the assets that gave rise to the excess federal deferred income taxes, ranging from 1 year to approximately 65 years. This regulatory liability has been increased to reflect the\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ntax benefit generated by the amortization of the excess deferred federal income taxes and is being amortized and credited to tax expense.\nOther. Other regulatory assets and liabilities comprise a number of deferred items including, among others, certain fair value adjustments related to the Mountaineer Acquisition, certain information technology costs, energy efficiency conservation costs and rate case expenses.\nOther Regulatory Matters\nUGI Utilities. On January 27, 2023, Electric Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $11. On September 21, 2023, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $9 annual base distribution rate increase for Electric Utility, effective October 1, 2023.\nOn January 28, 2022, PA Gas Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its base operating revenues for residential, commercial and industrial customers by $83 annually. On September 15, 2022, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement providing for a $49 annual base distribution rate increase for PA Gas Utility, through a phased approach, with $38 beginning October 29, 2022 and an additional $11 beginning October 1, 2023. In accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility will not be permitted to file a rate case prior to January 1, 2024. Also in accordance with the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a weather normalization adjustment rider as a five-year pilot program beginning on November 1, 2022. Under this rider, when weather deviates from normal by more than 3%, residential and small commercial customer billings for distribution services are adjusted monthly for weather related impacts exceeding the 3% threshold. Additionally, under the terms of the final order, PA Gas Utility was authorized to implement a DSIC once its total property, plant and equipment less accumulated depreciation reached $3,368 (which threshold was achieved in September 2022).\nOn February 8, 2021, Electric Utility filed a request with the PAPUC to increase its annual base distribution revenues by $9. On October 28, 2021, the PAPUC issued a final order approving a settlement that permitted Electric Utility, effective November 9, 2021, to increase its base distribution revenues by $6.\nMountaineer. On July 31, 2023, Mountaineer submitted its 2023 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of $10, an increase of $6, for costs associated with capital investments after December 31, 2022, that total $131, including $67 in calendar year 2024. With new base rates expected to be effective January 1, 2024, revenues from IREP rates would decrease by $12. The filing included capital investments totaling $383 over the 2024 - 2028 period.\nOn March 6, 2023, Mountaineer submitted a base rate case filing with the WVPSC seeking a net revenue increase of $20, which consisted of an increase in base rates of $38 and a decrease in the IREP rates of $18 annually to be effective on April 5, 2023. On March 31, 2023, the WVPSC suspended the effective date of the requested rate change increase until January 1, 2024 to allow for a full review of the filing. On October 6, 2023, Mountaineer filed a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement of the base rate case, which included a $14 net revenue increase. An order from the Commission is expected in December and new rates will take effect on January 1, 2024.\nOn July 29, 2022, Mountaineer submitted its 2022 IREP filing to the WVPSC requesting recovery of costs associated with capital investments totaling $354 over the 2023 - 2027 period, including $64 in calendar year 2023. On November 16, 2022, Mountaineer and the intervening parties submitted a joint stipulation and agreement for settlement to the WVPSC requesting approval of 2023 IREP revenue of $22 to be charged effective January 1, 2023, which includes the recovery of a $1 under-recovery of 2021 IREP revenue. On December 21, 2022, the WVPSC issued an order approving the joint stipulation and agreement for settlement as filed.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 10 - Inventories\nInventories comprise the following at September 30:\n2023 2022\nNon-utility LPG and natural gas $ 212 $ 335\nGas Utility natural gas 55 166\nEnergy certificates 64 70\nMaterials, supplies and other 102 94\nTotal inventories $ 433 $ 665\nNote 11 - Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment comprise the following at September 30:\n2023 2022 Estimated Useful Life\nUtility:\nDistribution $ 5,204 $ 4,746\nTransmission 123 123\nGeneral and other 660 557\nWork in process 95 124\nTotal Utility 6,082 5,550\nNon-utility:\nLand 174 179\nBuildings and improvements 418 426 10 - 40 years\nTransportation equipment 238 234 3 - 10 years\nEquipment, primarily cylinders and tanks 3,903 3,645 5 - 30 years\nElectric generation 190 216 25 - 40 years\nPipeline and related assets 1,577 1,523 25 - 40 years\nOther 390 380 1 - 12 years\nWork in process 156 53\nTotal non-utility 7,046 6,656\nTotal property, plant and equipment $ 13,128 $ 12,206\nThe average composite depreciation rates at our Gas Utility and Electric Utility were as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nRegulated natural gas utilities 2.4 % 2.6 % 2.6 %\nElectric Utility 2.3 % 2.4 % 2.3 %\nDepreciation expense totaled $476, $460 and $437 for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 12 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment are as follows:\nAmeriGas\nPropane UGI International Midstream & Marketing Utilities Total\nBalance September 30, 2021 $ 2,004 $ 993 $ 336 $ 437 $ 3,770\nPurchase accounting adjustments - - - (5) (5)\nForeign currency translation - (153) - - (153)\nBalance September 30, 2022 2,004 840 336 432 3,612\nImpairment of goodwill (656) - - - (656)\nAcquisitions - 3 - - 3\nForeign currency translation - 68 - - 68\nBalance September 30, 2023 $ 1,348 $ 911 $ 336 $ 432 $ 3,027\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Company identified interim impairment indicators related to goodwill within the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit: (1) AmeriGas Partners issued $500 of Senior Notes at an interest rate of 9.375%, which was significantly higher than the interest rates on the other AmeriGas Propane debt obligations; and (2) financial projections for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit were reduced significantly compared to previous forecasts following declines in gross margins and customer retention and higher operating expenses. The Company concluded that these events constituted triggering events that indicate that the AmeriGas Propane goodwill may be impaired and, as such, performed an interim impairment test of its goodwill as of May 31, 2023.\nUsing level 3 inputs, we performed a quantitative assessment of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit using a weighting of the income and market approaches to determine its fair value. With respect to the income approach, management used a discounted cash flow (DCF) method, using unobservable inputs. The significant assumptions in our DCF model include projected EBITDA and a discount rate (and estimates in the discount rate inputs). With respect to the market approach, management used recent transaction market multiples for similar companies in the U.S. The resulting estimates of fair value from the income approach and the market approach were then weighted equally in determining the overall estimated fair value of AmeriGas Propane.\nBased on our evaluation, the estimated fair value of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit was determined to be less than its carrying value. As a result, the Company recorded a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656, included in Impairment of goodwill on the Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Statement of Income, to reduce the carrying value of AmeriGas Propane to its fair value. The Company calculated the deferred tax effect using the simultaneous equation method.\nThe performance of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit and the potential for future developments in the global economic environment, including the prospect of higher interest rates, introduces a heightened risk for additional impairment in the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit. If there is continued deterioration in the results of operations, a portion or all of the remaining recorded goodwill for the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, which was $1.3 billion as of September 30, 2023, could be subject to further impairment.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nIntangible assets comprise the following at September 30:\n2023 2022\nCustomer relationships $ 977 $ 1,006\nTrademarks and tradenames 4 3\nNoncompete agreements and other 26 71\nAccumulated amortization (602) (621)\nIntangible assets, net (definite-lived) 405 459\nTrademarks and tradenames (indefinite-lived) 38 41\nTotal intangible assets, net $ 443 $ 500\nDuring Fiscal 2023, the Company recognized a $10 non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge related to customer relationships intangible assets and indefinite-lived tradenames at DVEP in connection with the wind-down of the energy marketing business in the Netherlands (see Note 5). During Fiscal 2021, the Company recognized a $20 non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge related to a customer relationship intangible asset at DVEP resulting from a decline in anticipated volumes attributable to a historical customer. These charges are reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAmortization expense of intangible assets was $56, $61 and $76 for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. Estimated amortization expense of intangible assets during the next five fiscal years is as follows: Fiscal 2024 - $53; Fiscal 2025 - $51; Fiscal 2026 - $50; Fiscal 2027 - $27; Fiscal 2028 - $18.\nNote 13 - Equity\nOn February 2, 2022, UGIs Board of Directors authorized an extension of an existing share repurchase program for up to 8,000,000 shares of UGI Corporation Common Stock for an additional four-year period, expiring February 2026. Pursuant to the Board authorization, during Fiscal 2023 and Fiscal 2022 the Company purchased and placed in treasury stock 600,000 shares and 900,000 shares at a total cost of $22 and $38, respectively. There were no such repurchases during Fiscal 2021.\nUGI Preferred Stock and Common Stock share activity for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 is as follows:\nPreferred Stock Common Stock\nIssued/Outstanding Issued Treasury Outstanding\nBalance at September 30, 2020 - 209,514,044 (1,159,606) 208,354,438\nIssued:\nEquity Unit Offering 220,000 - - -\nEmployee and director plans - 329,252 554,315 883,567\nReacquired common stock - employee and director plans - - (21,870) (21,870)\nBalance at September 30, 2021 220,000 209,843,296 (627,161) 209,216,135\nIssued:\nEmployee and director plans - 717,198 799,152 1,516,350\nRepurchases of common stock - - (900,000) (900,000)\nReacquired common stock - employee and director plans - - (250,273) (250,273)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 220,000 210,560,494 (978,282) 209,582,212\nIssued:\nEmployee and director plans - 345,558 167,313 512,871\nRepurchases of common stock - - (600,000) (600,000)\nBalance at September 30, 2023 220,000 210,906,052 (1,410,969) 209,495,083\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nUGI also has 5,000,000 shares of UGI Series Preference Stock authorized for issuance. UGI had no shares of UGI Series Preference Stock outstanding at September 30, 2023 or 2022.\nIssuance of Equity Units\nOn May 25, 2021, the Company issued 2.2 million Equity Units with a total notional value of $220. Each Equity Unit has a stated amount of $100 and consists of (i) a 10% undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Convertible Preferred Stock with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share and (ii) a 2024 Purchase Contract. The Company received approximately $213 of proceeds from the issuance of the Equity Units, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions, and issued 220,000 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock which was recorded in Preferred stock on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. The proceeds were used to pay a portion of the purchase price for the Mountaineer Acquisition and related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company reclassified certain amounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity related to the accounting for the Equity Units.\nConvertible Preferred Stock. Holders of the Convertible Preferred Stock will generally have no voting rights, except under the limited circumstances as described in the Equity Unit Agreements, and will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at an initial annual rate of 0.125% when, as, and if declared by the UGI Board of Directors, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing September 1, 2021. The Company may elect to pay such dividends in cash, shares of UGIs common stock or a combination of cash and shares of UGIs common stock. Unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Convertible Preferred Stock for prior completed dividend periods have been declared and paid, the Company may not make any distributions on, or repurchase, any of its capital stock ranking equal or junior to the Convertible Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation, subject to certain exceptions.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. The Company has the option to redeem all or a portion of the Convertible Preferred Stock at any time, and from time to time, on or after September 3, 2024, for cash at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock being redeemed plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted at the option of the holders on and after June 1, 2024, only after it has been separated from the Equity Units and, prior to June 1, 2024, only under limited circumstances in connection with a fundamental change, as defined in the Equity Unit Agreements. The Company will settle conversions by paying or delivering (i) one share of UGIs 0.125% Series B preferred stock (or, for conversions in connection with a redemption of the Convertible Preferred Stock, up to $1,000 per share in cash plus all accumulated but unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the payment date immediately preceding the relevant conversion date) per share of Convertible Preferred Stock being converted; and (ii) to the extent the conversion value exceeds the liquidation preference of the Convertible Preferred Stock, shares of UGIs common stock. The conversion rate is initially 19.0215 shares of UGIs common stock per one share of Convertible Preferred Stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $52.57 per share of UGIs common stock. At September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, there were 220,000 shares of Series B preferred stock authorized for issuance pursuant to the settlement terms discussed above.\nThe Convertible Preferred Stock can be remarketed during either (i) an optional remarketing period beginning on, and including, March 1, 2024 and ending on, and including, May 13, 2024 or (ii) a final remarketing period beginning on, and including, May 23, 2024 and ending on, and including, May 30, 2024. In connection with a successful remarketing, the conversion rate and dividend rate of the Convertible Preferred Stock may be increased, and the earliest redemption date for the Convertible Preferred Stock may be changed to a later date that is on or before August 29, 2025.\n2024 Purchase Contracts. The 2024 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to pay $100 to UGI to purchase a variable number of shares of UGI common stock on the purchase contract settlement date, which is scheduled to occur on June 1, 2024. The number of shares of UGI common stock to be issued upon settlement of each 2024 Purchase Contract on the purchase contract settlement date will be equal to $100 divided by the market value per share of UGI common stock, which will be determined over a market value averaging period preceding the settlement date, subject to a maximum settlement rate of 2.2826 shares of UGI common stock per 2024 Purchase Contract, subject to adjustment. The initial maximum settlement rate of the 2024 Purchase Contracts is approximately equal to $100 divided by the last reported sale price of $43.81 per share of UGI common stock on May 17, 2021. Absent any fundamental changes, as defined in the Equity Unit Agreements, the holders can settle the 2024 Purchase Contracts early, subject to certain exceptions and conditions. Upon early settlement of any 2024 Purchase Contracts, other than in connection with a fundamental change, the Company will deliver the number of shares of UGI common stock equal to 85% of the number of shares of UGI common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe Company will pay holders of the 2024 Purchase Contracts quarterly contract adjustment payments at an annual rate of 7.125%, payable quarterly in arrears on March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1, commencing September 1, 2021. The Company may elect to pay such contract adjustment payments in cash, shares of UGI common stock or a combination of cash and shares of UGI common stock. The Company may defer the contract adjustment payments for one or more consecutive periods but generally not beyond the purchase contract settlement date. If contract adjustment payments are deferred, the Company will be subject to certain dividend, distribution, and other restrictions related to its capital stock as defined in the Equity Unit Agreements.\nThe present value of the quarterly contract adjustment payments liability was $45 upon issuance of the Equity Units and is recorded in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities (with a corresponding reduction to UGI Preferred Stock) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As each quarterly contract adjustment payment is made, the related liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to Interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This accretion was not material during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022, and Fiscal 2021.\nNote 14 - Equity-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants equity-based awards to employees and non-employee directors comprising UGI stock options and, UGI Common Stock-based equity instruments. We recognized total pre-tax equity-based compensation expense of $17 ($13 after-tax), $15 ($11 after-tax) and $21 ($15 after-tax) in Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nUGI Equity-Based Compensation Plans and Awards. On January 29, 2021, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 IAP. Under the 2021 IAP, awards representing up to 20,500,000 shares of UGI Common Stock may be granted. UGI Unit Awards granted to employees and non-employee directors, including dividend equivalents, are settled in shares of UGI Common Stock and cash. The 2021 IAP supersedes and replaces the 2013 OICP for awards granted on or after February 1, 2021. The terms and conditions of the 2013 OICP will continue to govern any outstanding awards granted thereunder. Similar to the 2013 OICP, under the 2021 IAP, we may grant options to acquire shares of UGI Common Stock, SARs, UGI Units (comprising Stock Units and UGI Performance Units), other equity-based awards and cash to key employees and non-employee directors. The exercise price for options may not be less than the fair market value on the grant date. Awards granted under the 2021 IAP may vest immediately or ratably over a period of years, and stock options can be exercised no later than ten years from the grant date. Except in the event of retirement, death or disability, each grant, unless paid, will terminate when the participant ceases to be employed. There are certain change of control and retirement eligibility conditions that, if met, generally result in accelerated vesting or elimination of further service requirements.\nThere were 16,014,039 shares of Common Stock available for future grants under the 2021 IAP at September 30, 2023.\nUGI Stock Option Awards. We measure the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses certain key assumptions for such options related to the expected life, volatility, dividend yield and the Companys risk-free rate at the valuation date. The per share weighted average fair value of stock options granted under our option plans was $9.31, $8.47 and $6.05 in Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, there was $5 of unrecognized compensation cost associated with unvested stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. There were 8,358,125 stock options outstanding at September 30, 2023, of which, 7,122,824 stock options were exercisable with a weighted-average option price of $42.79.\nUGI Unit Awards. Awards of UGI Stock Units and UGI Performance Units subject to market-based conditions entitle the grantee to shares of UGI Common Stock or cash once the service condition is met and, with respect to UGI Performance Unit subject to market-based conditions, subject to UGIs TSR percentile rank relative to companies in the UGI comparator group. Recipients of UGI Performance Unit subject to market-based conditions are awarded a target number of such awards. The number of UGI Performance Units subject to market-based conditions ultimately paid at the end of the performance period (generally 3 years) may be higher or lower than the target amount, or even zero, based on UGIs TSR percentile rank relative to companies in the UGI comparator group. Grantees may receive 0% to 200% of the target award granted. Awards granted vest ratably over the performance period.\nIn January 2023, the Company granted the UGI EPS Performance Unit awards. UGI EPS Performance Unit awards entitle the grantee to shares of UGI Common Stock or cash once the service condition is met and subject to the achievement of a UGI EPS goal, which is a non-market performance condition. UGI EPS Performance Unit grant recipients are awarded a target number of UGI EPS Performance Units. The number of UGI EPS Performance Units ultimately paid at the end of the service period may\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nbe higher or lower than the target amount, or even zero, based upon the actual EPS performance. Grantees may receive 0% to 200% of the target award granted. The EPS performance period for the UGI EPS Performance Unit awards granted in January 2023 is October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2024.\nThe fair value of UGI Stock Units on the grant date is equal to the market price of UGI Stock on the grant date plus the fair value of dividend equivalents if applicable. The fair value of UGI Performance Units is estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. The fair value associated with the target award is accounted for as equity and the fair value of the award over the target, as well as all dividend equivalents, is accounted for as a liability. The fair value of UGI EPS Performance Units is equal to the market price of UGI stock on the grant date plus the fair value of dividend equivalents if applicable.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of UGI Stock Units, UGI Performance Units and EPS Performance Units granted to employees during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022, and Fiscal 2021 was $44.62, $51.24 and $41.41, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023, there was a total of $25 unrecognized compensation cost associated with UGI Unit awards outstanding that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. As of September 30, 2023, there were 1,502,253 UGI Unit awards outstanding with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $43.09 per share.\nNote 15 - Leases\nLessee\nWe lease various buildings and other facilities, real estate, vehicles, rail cars and other equipment, the majority of which are operating leases. We determine if a contract is or contains a lease by evaluating whether the contract explicitly or implicitly identifies an asset, whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of the identified leased asset and to direct its use.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. We recognize ROU assets at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. These payments are discounted using the discount rate implicit in the lease, when available. We apply an incremental borrowing rate, which is developed utilizing a credit notching approach based on information available at the lease commencement date, to substantially all of our leases as the implicit rate is often not available.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Renewal and termination options are not included in the lease term unless we are reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Leases with an original lease term of one year or less, including consideration of any renewal options assumed to be exercised, are not included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCertain lease arrangements, primarily fleet vehicle leases with lease terms of one to ten years, contain purchase options. The Company generally excludes purchase options in evaluating its leases unless it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Additionally, leases of fleet vehicles often contain residual value guarantees that are due at the end of the lease. Such amounts are included in the determination of lease liabilities when we are reasonably certain that they will be owed.\nCertain leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent on asset usage or are based on changes in index rates, such as the Consumer Price Index. The variable payments component of such leases cannot be determined at lease commencement and is not recognized in the measurement of ROU assets or lease liabilities, but is recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation occurs.\nSale-leaseback transaction. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, AmeriGas OLP completed a sale-leaseback transaction with an independent third party for the land, building and improvements of an office and service center located in Gardena, California. The office and service center was leased back to AmeriGas OLP under an operating lease agreement having an initial six-year term with an option to renew. In conjunction with the transaction, AmeriGas OLP received approximately $32 in cash proceeds which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $29, reflected in Other operating income, net on the Fiscal 2023 Consolidated Statement of Income.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nROU assets and lease liabilities recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30 are as follows:\n2023 2022 Location on the Balance Sheet\nROU assets:\nOperating lease ROU assets $ 420 $ 368 Other assets\nFinance lease ROU assets 50 48 Property, plant and equipment\nTotal ROU assets $ 470 $ 416\nLease liabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities - current $ 87 $ 82 Other current liabilities\nOperating lease liabilities - noncurrent 340 294 Other noncurrent liabilities\nFinance lease liabilities - current 5 4 Current maturities of long-term debt\nFinance lease liabilities - noncurrent 45 41 Long-term debt\nTotal lease liabilities $ 477 $ 421\nThe components of lease cost for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021 are as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $ 104 $ 96 $ 101\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of ROU assets 3 4 4\nInterest on lease liabilities 3 3 3\nVariable lease cost 2 6 4\nShort-term lease cost 4 2 2\nTotal lease cost $ 116 $ 111 $ 114\nThe following table presents the cash and non-cash activity related to lease liabilities included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021:\n2023 2022 2021\nCash paid related to lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows - operating leases $ 103 $ 95 $ 99\nOperating cash flows - finance leases $ 3 $ 3 $ 3\nFinancing cash flows - finance leases $ 1 $ 2 $ 3\nNon-cash lease liability activities:\nROU assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities $ 136 $ 72 $ 85\nROU assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities $ 6 $ 2 $ 1\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe following table presents the weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 2023 2022\nOperating leases 7.1 6.0\nFinance leases 5.3 3.7\nWeighted-average discount rate (%) 2023 2022\nOperating leases 4.5% 3.6%\nFinance leases 2.2% 1.8%\nExpected annual lease payments based on maturities of operating and finance leases, as well as a reconciliation to the lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, as of September 30, 2023, were as follows:\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 After 2028 Total Lease Payments Imputed Interest Lease Liabilities\nOperating leases $ 104 $ 86 $ 72 $ 61 $ 49 $ 130 $ 502 $ (75) $ 427\nFinance leases $ 5 $ 5 $ 5 $ 4 $ 4 $ 76 $ 99 $ (49) $ 50\nApproximately 80% of the operating lease liabilities presented above relate to AmeriGas Propane.\nAt September 30, 2023, operating and finance leases that had not yet commenced were not material.\nLessor\nWe enter into lessor arrangements for the purposes of storing, gathering or distributing natural gas and LPG. AmeriGas Propane and UGI International have lessor arrangements that grant customers the right to use small, medium and large storage tanks, which we classify as operating leases. These agreements contain renewal options for periods up to nine years and certain agreements at UGI International contain a purchase option. Energy Services leases certain natural gas gathering assets to customers, which we classify as operating leases. Lease income is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and included in Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Income (see Note 4).\nNote 16 - Commitments and Contingencies\nEnvironmental Matters\nUGI Utilities\nFrom the late 1800s through the mid-1900s, UGI Utilities and its former subsidiaries owned and operated a number of MGPs prior to the general availability of natural gas. Some constituents of coal tars and other residues of the manufactured gas process are today considered hazardous substances under the Superfund Law and may be present on the sites of former MGPs. Between 1882 and 1953, UGI Utilities owned the stock of subsidiary gas companies in Pennsylvania and elsewhere and also operated the businesses of some gas companies under agreement. By the early 1950s, UGI Utilities divested all of its utility operations other than certain gas and electric operations. Beginning in 2006 and 2008, UGI Utilities also owned and operated two acquired subsidiaries, with similar histories of owning, and in some cases operating, MGPs in Pennsylvania.\nUGI Utilities is subject to a COA with the PADEP to address the remediation of specified former MGP sites in Pennsylvania, which is scheduled to terminate at the end of 2031. In accordance with the COA, UGI Utilities is required to either obtain a certain number of points per calendar year based on defined eligible environmental investigatory and/or remedial activities at the MGPs, or make expenditures for such activities in an amount equal to an annual environmental minimum expenditure threshold. The annual minimum expenditure threshold of the COA is $5. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, our aggregate estimated accrued liabilities for environmental investigation and remediation costs related to the COA totaled $52 and $53, respectively.\nWe do not expect the costs for investigation and remediation of hazardous substances at Pennsylvania MGP sites to be material to UGI Utilities results of operations because UGI Utilities receives ratemaking recovery of actual environmental investigation and remediation costs associated with the sites covered by the COA. This ratemaking recognition reconciles the accumulated\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ndifference between historical costs and rate recoveries with an estimate of future costs associated with the sites. As such, UGI Utilities has recorded an associated regulatory asset for these costs because recovery of these costs from customers is probable (see Note 9).\nFrom time to time, UGI Utilities is notified of sites outside Pennsylvania on which private parties allege MGPs were formerly owned or operated by UGI Utilities or owned or operated by a former subsidiary. Such parties generally investigate the extent of environmental contamination or perform environmental remediation. Management believes that under applicable law UGI Utilities should not be liable in those instances in which a former subsidiary owned or operated an MGP. There could be, however, significant future costs of an uncertain amount associated with environmental damage caused by MGPs outside Pennsylvania that UGI Utilities directly operated, or that were owned or operated by a former subsidiary of UGI Utilities if a court were to conclude that (1) the subsidiarys separate corporate form should be disregarded, or (2) UGI Utilities should be considered to have been an operator because of its conduct with respect to its subsidiarys MGP. Neither the undiscounted nor the accrued liability for environmental investigation and cleanup costs for UGI Utilities MGP sites outside Pennsylvania were material for all periods presented.\nAmeriGas Propane\nAmeriGas OLP Saranac Lake. In 2008, the NYDEC notified AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had placed property purportedly owned by AmeriGas OLP in Saranac Lake, New York on the New York State Registry of Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Sites. A site characterization study performed by the NYDEC disclosed contamination related to a former MGP. AmeriGas OLP responded to the NYDEC in 2009 to dispute the contention it was a PRP as it did not operate the MGP and appeared to only own a portion of the site. In 2017, the NYDEC communicated to AmeriGas OLP that the NYDEC had previously issued three RODs related to remediation of the site totaling approximately $28 and requested additional information regarding AmeriGas OLPs purported ownership. AmeriGas OLP renewed its challenge to designation as a PRP and identified potential defenses. The NYDEC subsequently identified a third party PRP with respect to the site.\nThe NYDEC commenced implementation of the remediation plan in the spring of 2018. Based on our evaluation of the available information as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Partnership has an undiscounted environmental remediation liability of $8 related to the site. Our share of the actual remediation costs could be significantly more or less than the accrued amount.\nOther Matters\nWest Reading, Pennsylvania Explosion. On March 24, 2023, an explosion occurred in West Reading, Pennsylvania which resulted in seven fatalities, significant injuries to eleven others, and extensive property damage to buildings owned by R.M. Palmer, a local chocolate manufacturer, and other neighboring structures. The NTSB and the PAPUC are investigating the West Reading incident. On July 18, 2023, the NTSB issued an Investigative Update in its ongoing investigation. That report identifies a fracture in a retired UGI gas service tee and a fracture in a nearby steam system, but it does not address causation of the fractures or the explosion. The NTSB investigative team includes representatives from the Company, the PAPUC, the local fire department and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The Company is cooperating with the investigation. The NTSB may invite other parties to participate. In September 2023, OSHA closed their investigation of this matter, without any finding pertaining to UGI Utilities.\nWhile the investigation into this incident is still underway and the cause of the explosion has not been determined, the Company has received claims as a result of the explosion and is involved in lawsuits relative to the incident. The Company maintains liability insurance for personal injury, property and casualty damages and believes that third-party claims associated with the explosion, in excess of the Companys deductible, are recoverable through the Companys insurance. The Company cannot predict the result of these pending or future claims and legal actions at this time.\nRegarding these pending claims and legal actions, the Company does not believe, at this early stage, that there is sufficient information available to reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, or conclude that the final outcome of these matters will or will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nIn addition to the matters described above, there are other pending claims and legal actions arising in the normal course of our businesses. Although we cannot predict the final results of these pending claims and legal actions, including those described above, we believe, after consultation with counsel, that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material effect on our financial statements.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 17 - Fair Value Measurements\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following table presents, on a gross basis, our financial assets and liabilities, including both current and noncurrent portions, that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 2:\nAsset (Liability)\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nSeptember 30, 2023:\nDerivative instruments:\nAssets:\nCommodity contracts (c) $ 117 $ 115 $ - $ 232\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ 38 $ - $ 38\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ 28 $ - $ 28\nLiabilities:\nCommodity contracts (c) $ (193) $ (81) $ - $ (274)\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ (2) $ - $ (2)\nNon-qualified supplemental postretirement grantor trust investments (a) $ 39 $ - $ - $ 39\nSeptember 30, 2022\nDerivative instruments:\nAssets:\nCommodity contracts (b) $ 938 $ 1,268 $ 27 $ 2,233\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ 119 $ - $ 119\nInterest rate contracts $ - $ 66 $ - $ 66\nLiabilities:\nCommodity contracts (b) $ (377) $ (136) $ - $ (513)\nForeign currency contracts $ - $ (2) $ - $ (2)\nNon-qualified supplemental postretirement grantor trust investments (a) $ 43 $ - $ - $ 43\n(a)Consists primarily of mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts associated with non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (see Note 8).\n(b)Includes derivative assets and liabilities associated with the October 2022 sale of UGI International energy marketing business located in the U.K., classified as held for sale (see Note 5).\n(c)Includes derivative assets and liabilities associated with certain UGI International energy marketing business transactions (see Note 5).\nThe fair values of our Level 1 exchange-traded commodity futures and option contracts and non-exchange-traded commodity futures and forward contracts are based upon actively quoted market prices for identical assets and liabilities. Substantially all of the remaining derivative instruments are designated as Level 2. The fair values of certain non-exchange-traded commodity derivatives designated as Level 2 are based upon indicative price quotations available through brokers, industry price publications or recent market transactions and related market indicators. The fair values of our Level 2 interest rate contracts and foreign currency contracts are based upon third-party quotes or indicative values based on recent market transactions. The fair values of our Level 3 natural gas commodity contracts at September 30, 2022 attributable to our UGI International operations have been determined using unobservable inputs in an illiquid market and ranged from $7 to $27 given the available\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\ninputs considered. The fair values of investments held in grantor trusts are derived from quoted market prices as substantially all of the investments in these trusts have active markets.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2023, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test for its AmeriGas Propane reporting unit, which resulted in a non-cash pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $656 to reduce the carrying value of AmeriGas Propane to its fair value as of May 31, 2023. See Note 12 for further information on the results of the impairment test including the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of the AmeriGas Propane reporting unit.\nOther Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of other financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities (except for current maturities of long-term debt) approximate their fair values because of their short-term nature. We estimate the fair value of long-term debt by using current market rates and by discounting future cash flows using rates available for similar type debt (Level 2). The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt (including current maturities but excluding unamortized debt issuance costs) were as follows:\n2023 2022\nCarrying amount $ 6,647 $ 6,665\nEstimated fair value $ 6,238 $ 6,189\nFinancial instruments other than derivative instruments, such as short-term investments and trade accounts receivable, could expose us to concentrations of credit risk. We limit credit risk from short-term investments by investing only in investment-grade commercial paper, money market mutual funds, securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies and FDIC insured bank deposits. The credit risk arising from concentrations of trade accounts receivable is limited because we have a large customer base that extends across many different U.S. markets and a number of foreign countries. For information regarding concentrations of credit risk associated with our derivative instruments, see Note 18.\nNote 18 - Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe are exposed to certain market risks related to our ongoing business operations. Management uses derivative financial and commodity instruments, among other things, to manage: (1) commodity price risk; (2) interest rate risk; and (3) foreign currency exchange rate risk. Although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market risk associated with forecasted transactions, we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The use of derivative instruments is controlled by our risk management and credit policies, which govern, among other things, the derivative instruments we can use, counterparty credit limits and contract authorization limits. Although our commodity derivative instruments extend over a number of years, a significant portion of our commodity derivative instruments economically hedge commodity price risk during the next twelve months. For information on the accounting for our derivative instruments, see Note 2.\nThe following sections summarize the types of derivative instruments used by the Company to manage these market risks.\nCommodity Price Risk\nRegulated Utility Operations\nNatural Gas\nPA Gas Utilitys tariffs contain clauses that permit recovery of all prudently incurred costs of natural gas it sells to retail core-market customers, including the cost of financial instruments used to hedge purchased gas costs. As permitted and agreed to by the PAPUC pursuant to PA Gas Utilitys annual PGC filings, PA Gas Utility currently uses NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of the natural gas it purchases for its retail core-market customers. See Note 9 for further information on the regulatory accounting treatment for these derivative instruments.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNon-utility Operations\nLPG\nIn order to manage market price risk associated with the Partnerships fixed-price programs and to reduce the effects of short-term commodity price volatility, the Partnership uses over-the-counter derivative commodity instruments, principally price swap contracts. In addition, the Partnership and our UGI International operations also use over-the-counter price swap and option contracts to reduce commodity price volatility associated with a portion of their forecasted LPG purchases.\nNatural Gas\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for physical natural gas, Midstream & Marketing enters into NYMEX and over-the-counter natural gas futures and over-the-counter and ICE natural gas basis swap contracts. In addition, Midstream & Marketing uses NYMEX and over-the-counter futures and options contracts to economically hedge price volatility associated with the gross margin derived from the purchase and anticipated later near-term sale of natural gas storage inventories. Outside of the financial market, Midstream & Marketing also uses ICE and over-the-counter forward physical contracts. UGI International also uses natural gas futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with a substantial portion of anticipated volumes under fixed-price sales contracts with its customers.\nElectricity\nIn order to manage market price risk relating to fixed-price sales contracts for electricity, Midstream & Marketing enters into electricity futures and forward contracts. Midstream & Marketing also uses NYMEX and over-the-counter electricity futures contracts to economically hedge the price of a portion of its anticipated future sales of electricity from its electric generation facilities. UGI International also uses electricity futures and forward contracts to economically hedge market price risk associated with fixed-price sales and purchase contracts for electricity.\nInterest Rate Risk\nCertain of our long-term debt agreements have interest rates that are generally indexed to short-term market interest rates. In order to fix the underlying short-term market interest rates, we may enter into pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap agreements and designate such swaps as cash flow hedges. In March 2023, in connection with the Energy Services Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, Energy Services terminated and settled its existing interest rate swap associated with the Energy Services Term Loan Credit Agreement (see Note 6).\nThe remainder of our long-term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest. As this long-term debt matures, we typically refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then-current market conditions. In order to reduce market rate risk on the underlying benchmark rate of interest associated with near- to medium-term forecasted issuances of fixed-rate debt, from time to time we enter into IRPAs. We account for IRPAs as cash flow hedges. There were no unsettled IRPAs during any of the periods presented. At September 30, 2023, the amount of pre-tax net gains associated with interest rate hedges expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next twelve months is $46.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nForward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts\nIn order to reduce the volatility in net income associated with our foreign operations, principally as a result of changes in the USD exchange rate to the euro and British pound sterling, we enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts. We layer in these foreign currency exchange contracts over multi-year periods to eventually equal approximately 90% of anticipated UGI International foreign currency earnings before income taxes. Because these contracts are not designated as hedging instruments, realized and unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in Other non-operating (expense) income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNet Investment Hedges\nFrom time to time, we also enter into certain forward foreign currency exchange contracts to reduce the volatility of the USD value of a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investments, including anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. We account for these foreign currency exchange contracts as net investment hedges and all changes in\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nthe fair value of these contracts are reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component in AOCI. We use the spot rate method to measure ineffectiveness of our net investment hedges.\nConcurrent with the repayment of UGI Internationals 3.25% Senior Notes on December 7, 2021, we settled an associated net investment hedge having a notional value of \u20ac93. Additionally, in May 2022, we restructured certain net investment hedges associated with anticipated foreign currency denominated dividends. Cash flows from these settlements are included in cash flows from investing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nOur euro-denominated long-term debt has also been designated as net investment hedges, representing a portion of our UGI International euro-denominated net investment. We recognized pre-tax (losses) gains associated with these net investment hedges in the foreign currency component of AOCI totaling $(57), $123 and $9 during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022, and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nQuantitative Disclosures Related to Derivative Instruments\nThe following table summarizes by derivative type the gross notional amounts related to open derivative contracts at September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the final settlement dates of the Company's open derivative contracts as of September 30, 2023, but excluding those derivatives that qualified for the NPNS exception:\nNotional Amounts\n(in millions)\nSeptember 30,\nType Units Settlements Extending Through 2023 2022\nCommodity Price Risk:\nRegulated Utility Operations\nPA Gas Utility NYMEX natural gas futures and option contracts Dekatherms September 2024 38 19\nNon-utility Operations\nLPG swaps Gallons February 2026 727 874\nNatural gas futures, forward, basis swap, options and pipeline contracts (a) Dekatherms December 2027 338 363\nElectricity forward and futures contracts Kilowatt hours December 2026 1,260 2,446\nInterest Rate Risk:\nInterest rate swaps Euro March 2026 \u20ac 300 \u20ac 300\nInterest rate swaps USD September 2026 $ 1,270 $ 1,358\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk:\nForward foreign currency exchange contracts USD September 2026 $ 425 $ 465\nNet investment hedge forward foreign exchange contracts Euro December 2026 \u20ac 256 \u20ac 411\n(a)Amounts at September 30, 2023 and 2022 include contracts associated with certain UGI International energy marketing business transactions (see Note 5).\nDerivative Instrument Credit Risk\nWe are exposed to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our derivative instrument counterparties. Our derivative instrument counterparties principally comprise large energy companies and major U.S. and international financial institutions. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits or entering into netting agreements that allow for offsetting counterparty receivable and payable balances for certain financial transactions, as deemed appropriate.\nWe have concentrations of credit risk associated with derivative instruments and we evaluate the creditworthiness of our derivative counterparties on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2023, the maximum amount of loss, based upon the gross\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nfair values of the derivative instruments, we would incur if these counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of their contracts was $298. In general, many of our over-the-counter derivative instruments and all exchange contracts call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the Company in the forms of letters of credit, parental guarantees or cash. At September 30, 2023, we had received cash collateral from derivative instrument counterparties totaling $40. In addition, we may have offsetting derivative liabilities and certain accounts payable balances with certain of these counterparties, which further mitigates the previously mentioned maximum amount of losses. Certain of the Partnerships derivative contracts have credit-risk-related contingent features that may require the posting of additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of the Partnerships debt rating. At September 30, 2023, if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered, the amount of collateral required to be posted would not be material.\nOffsetting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are presented net by counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if the right of offset exists. We offset amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty. Our derivative instruments include both those that are executed on an exchange through brokers and centrally cleared and over-the-counter transactions. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange, or clearinghouse to enter, execute, or clear the transactions. Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a third party. Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of offset through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements, and contract default provisions. In addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of offset through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency or other conditions.\nIn general, many of our over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral generally include cash or letters of credit. Cash collateral paid by us to our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative liabilities. Cash collateral received by us from our over-the-counter derivative counterparties, if any, is reflected in the table below to offset derivative assets. Certain other accounts receivable and accounts payable balances recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with our derivative counterparties are not included in the table below but could reduce our net exposure to such counterparties because such balances are subject to master netting or similar arrangements.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nThe following table presents the Companys derivative assets and liabilities by type, as well as the effects of offsetting, as of September 30:\n2023 2022\nDerivative assets:\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign currency contracts $ 14 $ 57\nInterest rate contracts 28 66\n42 123\nDerivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms:\nCommodity contracts 6 31\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts (a) 226 2,202\nForeign currency contracts 24 62\n250 2,264\nTotal derivative assets - gross 298 2,418\nGross amounts offset in the balance sheet (124) (295)\nCash collateral received (40) (398)\nTotal derivative assets - net $ 134 $ 1,725\nDerivative liabilities:\nDerivatives subject to PGC and DS mechanisms:\nCommodity contracts $ (8) $ (26)\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts (a) (266) (487)\nForeign currency contracts (2) (2)\n(268) (489)\nTotal derivative liabilities - gross (276) (515)\nGross amounts offset in the balance sheet 124 295\nCash collateral pledged 53 7\nTotal derivative liabilities - net $ (99) $ (213)\n(a)Includes certain derivative contracts associated with UGI International energy marketing business transactions (see Note 5) that are classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2023 and 2022. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were $10 and $295 of derivative assets, respectively, included in Held for sale assets and $12 and $19 of derivative liabilities, respectively, included in Held for sale liabilities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nEffects of Derivative Instruments\nThe following tables provide information on the effects of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Income and changes in AOCI for Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021:\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in\nAOCI Gain (Loss)\nReclassified from\nAOCI into Income Location of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from\nAOCI into Income\n2023 2022 2021 2023 2022 2021\nCash Flow Hedges:\nInterest rate contracts $ 25 $ 91 $ 4 $ 40 $ (7) $ (25) Interest expense\nNet Investment Hedges:\nForeign currency contracts $ (21) $ 69 $ 4\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income Location of\nGain (Loss)\nRecognized in Income\n2023 2022 2021\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments:\nCommodity contracts $ 11 $ (9) $ (17) Revenues\nCommodity contracts (1,771) 1,181 1,545 Cost of sales\nCommodity contracts 2 1 5 Other operating income, net\nForeign currency contracts (23) 63 9 Other non-operating (expense) income, net\nTotal $ (1,781) $ 1,236 $ 1,542\nWe are also a party to a number of other contracts that have elements of a derivative instrument. However, these contracts qualify for NPNS exception accounting because they provide for the delivery of products or services in quantities that are expected to be used in the normal course of operating our business and the price in these contracts are based on an underlying that is directly associated with the price of the product or service being purchased or sold. These contracts include, among others, binding purchase orders, contracts that provide for the purchase and delivery, or sale, of energy products, and service contracts that require the counterparty to provide commodity storage, transportation or capacity service to meet our normal sales commitments.\nNote 19 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) principally comprises (1) gains and losses on derivative instruments qualifying as cash flow hedges, net of reclassifications to net income; (2) actuarial gains and losses on postretirement benefit plans, net of associated amortization; and (3) foreign currency translation and long-term intra-company transaction adjustments.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nThe tables below present changes in AOCI, net of tax, during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021:\nPostretirement\nBenefit\nPlans Derivative\nInstruments Foreign\nCurrency Total\nAOCI - September 30, 2020 $ (26) $ (54) $ (67) $ (147)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification adjustments 7 3 (23) (13)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 2 18 - 20\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to UGI 9 21 (23) 7\nAOCI - September 30, 2021 $ (17) $ (33) $ (90) $ (140)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification adjustments 28 64 (341) (249)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI 3 6 - 9\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to UGI 31 70 (341) (240)\nAOCI - September 30, 2022 $ 14 $ 37 $ (431) $ (380)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassification adjustments 5 16 132 153\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI (2) (27) - (29)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to UGI 3 (11) 132 124\nAOCI - September 30, 2023 $ 17 $ 26 $ (299) $ (256)\nNote 20 - Other Operating Income, Net and Other Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther Operating Income, Net\nOther operating income, net, comprises the following:\n2023 2022 2021\nFinance charges $ 17 $ 18 $ 17\nGains on sales of fixed assets, net (a) 61 33 11\nGain on early derivative termination - - 5\nForeign currency transaction gains (losses) 7 (5) -\nCylinder deposit income 23 18 9\nInterest and interest-related income 6 1 -\nOther, net 18 14 (9)\nTotal other operating income, net $ 132 $ 79 $ 33\n(a)Fiscal 2023 includes a $15 gain on the sale of UGI Corporations headquarters building in August 2023.\nOther Non-Operating (Expense) Income, Net\nOther non-operating (expense) income, net comprises the following:\n2023 2022 2021\n(Losses) gains on foreign currency contracts, net $ (23) $ 63 $ 9\nAmortization of excluded components of certain net investment hedges\n7 7 2\nPension and other postretirement plans non-service income, net 9 5 1\nTotal other non-operating (expense) income, net $ (7) $ 75 $ 12\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 21 - Equity Method Investments\nEquity method investments which are included within Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, comprises the following as of September 30:\nCarrying Value Ownership Interest\nInvestees 2023 2022 2023 2022\nMidstream & Marketing\nAurum Renewables $ 45 $ - 40% N/A\nPine Run 77 68 49% 49%\nMBL Bioenergy 122 23 99.99% 99.99%\nOther 20 18 various various\nTotal Midstream & Marketing 264 109\nUGI International 35 21 various various\nTotal investments in equity method investees $ 299 $ 130\nAurum Renewables. In January 2023, the Company, through its wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a joint venture agreement with a third party Archaea Holdings, LLC (Archaea). The primary purpose of the joint venture, Aurum Renewables LLC, is to upgrade landfill gas from the Commonwealth Environmental Systems landfill located in Hegins, Pennsylvania to pipeline-quality RNG. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company contributed its existing 11 megawatt landfill gas-to-electricity facility, as non-cash consideration, in return for a 40% equity interest in the joint venture. Once complete, the project is expected to have the capacity to produce approximately 5,000 MMBtu per day of pipeline-quality RNG. Archaea will lead the development, engineering, construction, and operation of the new RNG facility, and Energy Services will take a lead role in marketing the RNG produced by the facility.\nPine Run. Pine Run is a company jointly owned by UGI Pine Run, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Services) and Stonehenge Energy Resources. In February 2021, Pine Run completed the acquisition of Pine Run Midstream, an affiliate of PennEnergy, and minority partners for approximately $205. The acquisition was funded by cash contributions by UGI Pine Run, LLC and Stonehenge Energy Resources totaling approximately $115, and the issuance by Pine Run of $90 of long-term debt. Pine Run Midstream operates dry gas gathering pipelines and compression assets in western Pennsylvania. Pine Run is accounted for as an equity method investment as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the entity.\nMBL Bioenergy. MBL Bioenergy is a company jointly owned by UGI Dakota, LLC (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Energy Services), Sevana Bioenergy and a subsidiary of California Bioenergy. The sole purpose of MBL Bioenergy is the development of RNG projects in South Dakota comprising three dairy waste anaerobic digester systems. MBL Bioenergy is a variable interest entity whereby the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary since it does not direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance. In addition to consent being required for all equity holders for significant activities, such as major procurement, construction contracting and offtake, our partners manage the day-to-day project management and operations for MBL Bioenergy and its subsidiaries.\nPennant. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, Energy Services completed the Pennant Acquisition and acquired the remaining 53% of the equity interests in Pennant. Prior to the Pennant Acquisition, the Companys investment in Pennant was accounted for as an equity method investment as we had the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over the entity. The acquisition of the remaining interests was accounted for as an acquisition of assets, and the purchase price of approximately $61 was primarily allocated to property, plant and equipment. In connection with the acquisition of the controlling financial interest in Pennant, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary pre-tax impairment charge of $44 related to its then existing 47% membership interest, which amount is reflected in Income (loss) from equity investees in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPennEast. UGI PennEast, LLC and four other members each hold a 20% membership interest in PennEast. PennEast was formed to construct an approximate 120-mile natural gas pipeline from Luzerne County, Pennsylvania to the Trenton-\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nWoodbury interconnection in New Jersey. PennEast is accounted for as an equity method investment as we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over PennEast.\nDuring the third-quarter of Fiscal 2021, the partners of the PennEast project re-assessed the remaining legal and regulatory contingencies which needed to be resolved before construction could commence. Based on the significant remaining legal challenges and the expected further delays in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, which were preventing the commencement of construction and commercial operation of the project, the Company concluded that its investment in PennEast was impaired at June 30, 2021, and that such impairment was other-than-temporary. The estimated fair value of the Companys investment in PennEast was measured using probability-weighted cash flows under an expected present value technique based on management's estimates and assumptions regarding the likelihood of certain outcomes (and the related timing) that would be used by market participants at the time. Based upon this analysis, the Company recognized an other-than-temporary pre-tax impairment charge of $93 in June 2021, which is reflected in Income (loss) from equity investees in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIn September 2021, the PennEast partners announced that further development of the project is no longer supported and all further development has ceased. Following this announcement, the estimated fair value of the remaining assets of the project was assessed using the liquidation value of equipment held by PennEast. Such assessment did not result in a material change in the carrying value and no further impairment loss was recognized. The estimated fair value of the Companys investment in PennEast was determined to be a Level 2 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, the Company recognized $9 of equity earnings related to the ongoing liquidation of PennEast assets. The carrying value of our investment in PennEast at September 30, 2023 and 2022 was not material.\nOther Equity Method Investments. The carrying values of our other equity investments totaled $55 and $39 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and principally comprise a number of investments in biomass and other renewable energy projects at Energy Services and an investment in a renewable energy joint venture at UGI International.\nOur maximum exposure to loss related to these investments is limited to the amount invested.\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nNote 22 - Segment Information\nOur operations comprise four reportable segments generally based upon products or services sold, geographic location and regulatory environment: (1) AmeriGas Propane; (2) UGI International; (3) Midstream & Marketing; and (4) Utilities.\nAmeriGas Propane derives its revenues principally from the sale of propane and related equipment and supplies to retail customers in all 50 states. UGI International derives its revenues principally from the distribution of LPG to retail customers throughout much of Europe. In addition, UGI International derives revenue from energy marketing business that primarily markets natural gas and electricity to customers in France, the Netherlands and, prior to its sales, in Belgium and the United Kingdom (see Note 5 regarding the sale and wind-down of the UGI International energy marketing business). Midstream & Marketing derives its revenues principally from the sale of natural gas, liquid fuels and electricity as well as revenues and fees from storage, pipeline transportation, natural gas gathering, and natural gas and RNG production activities primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. eastern Ohio, the panhandle of West Virginia and California. Midstream & Marketing also derives revenues from the sale of electricity through PJM, a regional electricity transmission organization in the eastern U.S. Our Utilities segment primarily derives its revenues from the sale and distribution of natural gas to customers in eastern and central Pennsylvania and subsequent to the Mountaineer Acquisition in September 2021, in West Virginia (see Note 5). To a much lesser extent, Utilities also derives revenues from the sale and distribution of electricity in two northeastern Pennsylvania counties.\nCorporate & Other includes certain items that are excluded from our CODMs assessment of segment performance (see below for further details on these items). Corporate & Other also includes the net expenses of UGIs captive general liability insurance company, UGIs corporate headquarters facility and UGIs unallocated corporate and general expenses as well as interest expense on UGI debt that is not allocated. Corporate & Other assets principally comprise cash and cash equivalents of UGI and its captive insurance company, and UGI corporate headquarters assets.\nThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. Our CODM evaluates the performance of all of our reportable segments based upon earnings before interest expense and income taxes, excluding the items noted below.\nNo single customer represents more than ten percent of our consolidated revenues. In addition, all of our reportable segments revenues, other than those of UGI International, are derived from sources within the United States, and all of our reportable segments long-lived assets, other than those of UGI International, are located in the United States. The amounts of revenues and long-lived assets associated with our operations in France represent approximately 20% and 10% of the respective consolidated amounts.\nTotal Elim-\ninations AmeriGas\nPropane UGI International Midstream\n& Marketing Utilities Corporate &\nOther (a)\nRevenues from external customers $ 8,928 $ - $ 2,581 $ 2,965 $ 1,596 $ 1,780 $ 6\nIntersegment revenues $ - $ (326) (b) $ - $ - $ 251 $ 74 $ 1\nCost of sales $ 6,937 $ (325) (b) $ 1,250 $ 2,045 $ 1,360 $ 953 $ 1,654\nOperating (loss) income $ (1,444) $ - $ 268 $ 215 $ 285 $ 357 $ (2,569)\nIncome (loss) from equity investees 2 - - (4) 6 - -\nLoss on extinguishments of debt (9) - - - - - (9)\nOther non-operating (loss) income, net (7) - - 23 - 8 (38)\n(Loss) earnings before interest expense and income taxes (1,458) - 268 234 291 365 (2,616)\nInterest expense (379) - (163) (37) (45) (82) (52)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) 335 - (34) (25) (53) (64) 511\nNet (loss) income attributable to UGI $ (1,502) $ - $ 71 $ 172 $ 193 $ 219 $ (2,157)\nDepreciation and amortization $ 532 $ - $ 177 $ 116 $ 86 $ 152 $ 1\nTotal assets $ 15,401 $ (173) $ 3,415 $ 3,105 $ 3,160 $ 5,691 $ 203\nShort-term borrowings $ 649 $ - $ - $ 214 $ 103 $ 332 $ -\nCapital expenditures (including the effects of accruals) $ 956 $ 134 $ 129 $ 130 $ 563 $ -\nInvestments in equity investees $ 299 $ - $ - $ 35 $ 264 $ - $ -\nUGI Corporation and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Currency in millions, except per share amounts and where indicated otherwise)\nTotal Elim-\ninations AmeriGas\nPropane UGI International Midstream\n& Marketing Utilities Corporate &\nOther (a)\nRevenues from external customers $ 10,106 $ - $ 2,943 $ 3,686 $ 1,957 $ 1,515 $ 5\nIntersegment revenues $ - $ (477) (b) $ - $ - $ 369 $ 105 $ 3\nCost of sales $ 5,973 $ (474) (b) $ 1,613 $ 2,751 $ 1,876 $ 798 $ (591)\nOperating income $ 1,666 $ - $ 307 $ 237 $ 246 $ 327 $ 549\n(Loss) income from equity investees (14) - - (2) 23 - (35)\nLoss on extinguishments of debt (11) - - - - - (11)\nOther non-operating income, net 75 - - 19 - 9 47\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes 1,716 - 307 254 269 336 550\nInterest expense (329) - (160) (28) (41) (65) (35)\nIncome tax expense (313) - (35) (50) (65) (65) (98)\nNoncontrolling interests net (income) loss (1) - - (1) - - -\nNet income attributable to UGI $ 1,073 $ - $ 112 $ 175 $ 163 $ 206 $ 417\nDepreciation and amortization $ 518 $ - $ 177 $ 116 $ 79 $ 144 $ 2\nTotal assets $ 17,575 $ (203) $ 4,332 $ 4,610 $ 3,286 $ 5,354 $ 196\nShort-term borrowings $ 368 $ - $ 131 $ 1 $ - $ 236 $ -\nCapital expenditures (including the effects of accruals) $ 835 $ - $ 128 $ 107 $ 38 $ 562 $ -\nInvestments in equity investees $ 130 $ - $ - $ 20 $ 109 $ - $ 1\nRevenues from external customers $ 7,447 $ - $ 2,614 $ 2,651 $ 1,182 $ 1,015 $ (15)\nIntersegment revenues $ - $ (291) (b) $ - $ - $ 224 $ 64 $ 3\nCost of sales $ 2,614 $ (288) (b) $ 1,217 $ 1,598 $ 1,033 $ 458 $ (1,404)\nOperating income $ 2,350 $ - $ 385 $ 314 $ 160 $ 241 $ 1,250\n(Loss) income from equity investees (63) - - - 30 - (93)\nOther non-operating income, net 12 - - 3 - 1 8\nEarnings before interest expense and income taxes 2,299 - 385 317 190 242 1,165\nInterest expense (310) - (159) (27) (42) (56) (26)\nIncome tax expense (522) - (58) (69) (41) (42) (312)\nNet income attributable to UGI $ 1,467 $ - $ 168 $ 221 $ 107 $ 144 $ 827\nDepreciation and amortization $ 502 $ - $ 173 $ 134 $ 76 $ 119 $ -\nTotal assets $ 16,723 $ (241) $ 4,485 $ 4,421 $ 3,010 $ 4,859 $ 189\nShort-term borrowings $ 367 $ - $ 170 $ - $ - $ 197 $ -\nCapital expenditures (including the effects of accruals) $ 674 $ - $ 130 $ 107 $ 43 $ 394 $ -\nInvestments in equity investees $ 174 $ - $ - $ 11 $ 163 $ - $ -\n(a)Corporate & Other includes specific items attributable to our reportable segments that are not included in the segment profit measures used by our CODM in assessing our reportable segments performance or allocating resources.

Beginning in Fiscal 2019, we began executing on multi-year business transformation initiatives at our AmeriGas Propane and UGI International business segments. These initiatives are designed to improve long-term operational performance by, among other things, reducing costs and improving efficiency in the areas of sales and marketing, supply and logistics, operations, purchasing, and administration. In addition, these business transformation initiatives focus on enhancing the customer experience through, among other things, enhanced customer relationship management and an improved digital customer experience. During Fiscal 2021 we incurred $87 of costs principally comprising consulting, advisory, marketing and employee-related costs. These costs are primarily reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. These previously announced business transformation initiatives were substantially complete by the end of Fiscal 2021.\nCorporate Services. Beginning in Fiscal 2020, we initiated a transformation project focused on our support functions including: finance, procurement, human resources, and information technology. This initiative will standardize processes and activities across our global platform, while leveraging the use of best practices and efficiencies between our businesses. In connection with this initiative, during Fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, we incurred costs of $10, $9, and $14, respectively, that are reflected in Operating and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This transformation project was substantially complete by the end of Fiscal 2023.\nUGI CORPORATION\nSCHEDULE I - CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT (PARENT COMPANY)\nBALANCE SHEETS\n(Millions of dollars)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 7 $ 20\nAccounts receivable - related parties 11 24\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 23 20\nTotal current assets 41 64\nProperty, plant and equipment, net - 1\nInvestments in subsidiaries 5,343 7,035\nOther assets 143 97\nTotal assets $ 5,527 $ 7,197\nLIABILITIES AND COMMON STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt $ 38 $ 125\nAccounts and notes payable 28 20\nAccrued liabilities 39 51\nTotal current liabilities 105 196\nLong-term debt 969 889\nOther noncurrent liabilities 67 46\nTotal liabilities 1,141 1,131\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 1)\nEquity:\nPreferred Stock, without par value (authorized - 5,000,000; issued - 220,000 and 220,000, respectively)\n167 162\nCommon Stock, without par value (authorized - 450,000,000 shares; issued - 210,906,052 and 210,560,494 shares, respectively)\n1,503 1,483\nRetained earnings 3,027 4,841\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (256) (380)\nTreasury stock, at cost (55) (40)\nTotal common stockholders equity 4,386 6,066\nTotal liabilities and common stockholders equity $ 5,527 $ 7,197\nNote 1 - Commitments and Contingencies:\nAt September 30, 2023, UGI Corporation had agreed to indemnify the issuers of $105 of surety bonds issued on behalf of certain UGI subsidiaries.
