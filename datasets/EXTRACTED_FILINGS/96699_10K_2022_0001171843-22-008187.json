    "content": "Item 1.\nBUSINESS\nTechnical Communications Corporation was organized in 1961 as a Massachusetts corporation to engage primarily in consulting activities. Since the late 1960s, the business has consisted entirely of the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services. The secure communications solutions provided by TCC protect vital information transmitted over a wide range of data, video, fax and voice networks. TCCs products have been sold into over 115 countries to governments, military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions and multinational corporations. The Companys business consists of one industry segment, which is the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services.\nOverview\nThe Companys products consist of sophisticated electronic devices that enable users to transmit information in an encrypted format and permit recipients to reconstitute the information in a deciphered format if the recipient possesses the right decryption key. The Companys products can be used to protect confidentiality in communications between radios, landline telephones, mobile phones, facsimile machines and data network equipment over wires, fiber optic cables, radio waves, and microwave and satellite links. The principal markets for the Companys products are foreign and domestic governmental entities, law enforcement and military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions, and multinational companies requiring protection of mission-critical information.\nTCC historically and presently designs and develops its own equipment and software to meet the requirements of general secure communications applications, as well as the custom-tailored requirements of specific users. A customer may order equipment that is specially programmed to encrypt transmissions in accordance with a code to which only the customer has access. Management believes the coordinated development of cryptographic software and associated hardware allows TCC to provide high-strength encryption security products with efficient processing and transmission. Both criteria, the Company believes, are essential to customer satisfaction.\nTCC manufactures most of its products using third-party vendors for the supply of components and selected processing. Final assembly, software loading, testing and quality assurance are performed by TCC at its factory. This manufacturing approach allows TCC to competitively procure the components from multiple suppliers while maintaining control of the manufacture and performance of the final product.\nTCCs products are sold worldwide through a variety of channels depending on the country and the customer. Generally, TCC does not use stocking distributors because the Companys products are required to be sold under an applicable U.S. government license, which generally requires end-user information. Rather, the Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. The marketing and selling approach varies with each country and often involves extensive test and demonstration activity prior to the consummation of a sale. TCC has a network of in-country representatives and consultants who conduct performance demonstrations, market the products and close the sale, and who handle on behalf of TCC many of the ancillary requirements pertaining to importation duties, taxes, registration fees, and product receipt and acceptance. After-sale, in-country support by the representatives maintains customer satisfaction and provides a liaison for the Companys customer support services.\nProviding secure communications systems and services for government and military markets worldwide remains a principal focus for TCC, as the Company believes continued concerns over security will sustain demand for increased protection of both voice and data networks. Our focus in the government market also now includes law enforcement special operations customers. Additionally, we see increased interest for secure communications in the corporate industrial sector. The Company is pursuing selected, evolutionary upgrades and product derivatives of our government/military products both to provide entry into these markets and meet new requirements of our existing customers.\nProducts and Services\nDescribed below is TCCs portfolio of communications security solutions for mission-critical voice, data, fax and video networks for military, government and corporate/industrial applications.\nThe Government Systems product line has traditionally been the Companys core product base and typically generates the majority of the Companys revenue. During fiscal 2022, 18% of revenue was generated from our Government Systems product line and 76% was generated by our engineering services. During fiscal 2021, 40% of revenue was generated from our Government Systems product line and 59% was generated by our engineering services. Although we expect engineering services to remain strong, we also expect that revenue from our Government Systems products will constitute the majority of our revenue in the future. These products, such as the internet protocol data encryption systems and the DSP 9000/HSE 6000 radio encryption system, have proven to be highly durable, and have led to significant repeat business from our government customers. The Company believes that these products and their derivatives will continue to be the Companys most significant source of near-term future revenues.\nWith the availability of our next-generation IP encryptors and the ability to integrate customer-specific national algorithms, the Company believes that its Network Security Systems are competitive for a growing niche of mission-critical government and industrial/corporate network applications worldwide. TCC expects that future derivatives of its IP encryptor and KEYNET IP Manager system will expand the market opportunity for these products.\nThe Companys Secure Office Systems product line had primarily consisted of products that were originally acquired through an asset and rights purchase from a subsidiary of AT&T in 1995. These products are no longer being marketed although several are still available and will continue to be offered as inventory permits. TCC also continues to offer CipherTalk\u00ae secure mobile phone communication solutions. The Cipher Talk 8500, a secure mobile IP-based phone that targets the high-end secure wireless mobile phone market, is competitive but product demand has not developed as expected. We will continue to market this product with reduced expectations.\nThe Company also provides customized tools, products and training upon a customers request, as well as design solutions for OEM requirements. In addition, the Company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and system development. These services are typically billed to a customer on a time and materials basis and can run for several months to several years depending on the scope of the project. Fiscal year 2019 was a significant year for sales of our engineering services, with more modest revenue generated from services during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020; we expect demand for such services to remain strong in the future.\nGovernment Systems\nThe Companys DSP 9000 and HSE 6000 secure radio product lines offer strategic-level security for voice and data communications sent over High Frequency, or HF, Very High Frequency, or VHF, and Ultra High Frequency, or UHF, channels. Designed for military environments, the Company believes these products provide high voice quality over poor line connections, making them an attractive security solution for military aircraft, naval, base station and man-pack radio applications. These products provide automated key distribution for security and ease of use. They are also radio independent because software programmable interfaces allow radio interface levels to be changed without configuring the hardware. Base station, handset and embedded board configurations are available options. All versions interoperate with TCCs HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor for cross-network secure voice conferencing. The DSP 9000 base station model also interoperates with the Companys CSD 3324 SE secure telephone system to enable office-to-field communications.\nTCCs HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor is designed for public safety special operations, land mobile radio applications, as well as military applications. With the optional telephone interconnect kit, the HSE 6000 connects to corded handset telephones for secure voice communications and radio-to-telephone conferencing over Voice over IP, digital, and analog telephone networks. It is also interoperable with the DSP 9000 radio security product family, enabling secure voice communications and cross-network conferencing across and between air, land, sea and office.\nThe Companys CSD 3324 SE Secure Telephone, Fax and Data system provides strategic-level communications security for voice, fax and data encryption in a telephone package designed for government applications needing high reliability. The product has a fallback mode, which was originally developed for poor HF channels. As a result, secure communications are possible even over poor line conditions. TCC's high-level encryption and automated key distribution system protect sensitive information, and internal storage of 800 keys provides hands-off security.\nThe Companys CSD 3324 SP telephone and fax system provides integrated secure voice and fax security in a telephone package designed for government and corporate applications. The CSD 3324 SPV secure telephone secures voice communications over the public switched telephone network and interoperates with the CSD 3324 SP system.\nGovernment customers can also utilize the Companys Cipher X family of Cyber Security Appliances, described below, to achieve superior-grade network encryption and secure communications.\nThe Government Systems product line also includes the Companys DSD 72A-SP Military Bulk Ciphering System, a rugged military system that provides a high level of cryptographic security for military data networks operating at up to 34 million bits per second. The product supports a wide variety of interfaces and is designed to integrate into existing networks. Due to diminished demand in recent years, this product is no longer being marketed. However, we continue to support a large installed base of such equipment still in use with our customers, as there remains a demand for spare parts and small network upgrades. Foreign military requirements for the DSD 72A-SP are expected to transition over time to the data encryption systems product line using the Internet Protocol, described below.\nNetwork Security Systems\nTCC offers network encryption systems with centralized key and device management for Internet protocol, or IP, Synchronous Optical Network & Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, or SONET/SDH, and frame relay networks to secure data in transit from local area network to local area network and across wide area networks. TCCs KEYNET IP Manager is designed to centrally configure and manage a network of encryption appliances for secure communications and can be used globally. The Company also offers KEYNET Lite, a version of KEYNET for small networks.\nThe Company supports the industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard, or AES, 256-bit cryptographic algorithm and can integrate customer-specific national algorithms to meet customer-specific needs. All of TCCs encryption systems are designed to seamlessly overlay onto existing networks without requiring infrastructure changes. Network performance impact is negligible and we believe the systems are easy to deploy, use, monitor and manage. Additionally, the Cipher X family offers scalable performance to higher speeds without changing hardware. This minimizes the entry cost of deploying a security solution and provides a cost-effective path to meet evolving business needs. Upgrades are licensed and made available on-demand via the KEYNET management system. All performance levels interoperate and are designed to have identical functionality.\nThe Cipher X 7211 network security device is the 100 Mb/s to 1 Gb/s model of the family of TCC Cyber Security Appliances. Cipher X 7211 IP Encryption with KEYNET IP Manager provides strategic-level secure communications for large global IP networks for point-to-point and multicast applications such as video conferencing. It offers a unique combination of flexibility, scalable 1 gigabit per second performance and KEYNET IP Manager for ease of use. The Cipher X 7211 is a hardware-based, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 designed encryption device.\nThe Cipher X 7220 network security device is the 10 Gb/s model of the family of TCC Cyber Security Appliances. The Cipher X 7220 is ideally suited for global Ethernet networks with high performance requirements, and we believe it integrates seamlessly into existing networks without degrading performance. Its hardware-based layer 2, 3 and 4 encryption engines encrypt and decrypt outbound and inbound traffic at full wire speed.\nThe Cipher X 7210 network security device is the 100 Mb/s model in the product family, best suited for applications with low-bandwidth requirements, such as remote offices. Like the 7220, it is designed to integrate into existing networks without degrading network performance and provide encryption and decryption of outbound and inbound traffic at full wire speed.\nSecure Office Systems\nThe CipherTalk 8500 secure mobile phone is designed to provide military-grade encrypted voice and text communications anywhere in the world over Global System for Mobile Communications, or GSM, and Wi-Fi networks. Introduced in fiscal 2016, the CipherTalk 8500 IP-based secure wireless phone is built on a hardened AndroidTM smartphone platform for security and ease of use. TCC also offers a server-based, network management system that provides the customer with total control of network connectivity.\nThe Companys CSD 4100 executive secure telephone offers strategic-level voice and data security in an executive telephone package. Exceptional voice quality can be achieved with three different voice-coding algorithms. The product provides ease-of-use security features such as automated key management, authentication, certification and access control. Due to diminished demand in recent years, this product is no longer being marketed but we continue to provide support to existing customers that have installed equipment bases requiring expansion or modification. The Company also continues to offer the CSD 3324 SE, our encrypted office telephone that offers secure voice, fax and radio communications, as part of its Secure Office Systems product line.\nServices\nThe Company performs funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how actual costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts that are expected to exceed one year in duration, revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. The Company typically receives periodic progress payments on these types of contracts.\nTCC offers general communications security education for businesses and other users, including military and government entities, as well as product-specific training for its customers. TCC also specializes in developing and designing custom cryptographic solutions for customers unique secure voice, data and video communications requirements and integrating such solutions into existing systems. The Company has designed embedded secure radio encryption solutions, national algorithms for military data applications, cryptographic modules for National Secure Mode Identification Friend or Foe, or IFF, systems, as well as rocket-borne telemetry encryption modules, and country-unique secure telephone and fax algorithms. In addition, TCC has partnered with network and telecommunications equipment providers to add security in unique applications.\nCompetition\nThe market for communications security devices and systems is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. The Company has several competitors, including foreign-based companies, in the communications security device field. The Company believes its principal competitors include Thales Group, Codan Limited and Fortinet, Inc.\nThe Company competes based on its service, the operational and technical features of its products, its customization abilities, its sales expertise, and pricing. Many of TCCs competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources, greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers. Competitors with greater financial resources can be more aggressive in marketing campaigns, can survive sustained price reductions in order to gain market share and can devote greater resources to support existing products and develop new competing products.\nOur competitive position also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain and maintain intellectual property protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and secure sufficient capital resources for product, research and development efforts. We believe the ability of TCC to custom-tailor cryptographic functions and systems to satisfy unique customer requirements is an important competitive differentiator, and will meet a growing demand as customers become more sophisticated in defining their communications security needs.\nNet Revenue and Backlog\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company had two customers representing 91% of total net revenue. This revenue was derived from sales of our engineering services amounting to $996,000 and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to one Far East country amounting to $192,000 and a shipment of our internet protocol data encryptors amounting to $80,000 and some training provided to a North African country in the amount of $36,000.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company had two customers representing 74% of total net revenue. This revenue was derived from sales of our engineering services amounting to $1,107,000 and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to one north African country amounting to $148,000 and three domestic customers for deployment into a Middle Eastern country amounting to $270,000, for deployment into a North African country amounting to $98,000 and for deployment into Afghanistan amounting to $77,000, and shipments of our internet protocol data encryptors amounting to $19,000.\nThe Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. International sales are made primarily through our main office. We seldom have long-term contractual relationships with our customers and, therefore, generally have no assurance of a continuing relationship within a given market.\nOrders for our products are usually placed by customers on an as-needed basis and we typically ship products within 30 to 180 days of receipt of a customer's firm purchase order. Our backlog consists of orders received where the anticipated shipping date or services to be performed are within 12 months of the order date. Because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or the cancellation of orders, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenue in any future period. Our backlog as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 was approximately $80,000 and $1,090,000, respectively.\nFor certain services contracts, the Company will bill customers in accordance with the terms of the contract, but recognize revenue as the services are performed. The billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. These deferred revenues are recognized in future periods as we perform the services. There was no deferred revenue at September 24, 2022 or September 25, 2021.\nConsistent with TCCs historical experience, the Company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of the Companys revenues for the foreseeable future. A reduction in orders from any such customer, or the cancellation of any significant order and failure to replace such order with orders from other customers, would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulatory Matters\nAs a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company must comply with extensive regulations with respect to bid proposals and billing practices. Should the U.S. government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be canceled and the Company could be prohibited from bidding on or participating in future contracts. Such a prohibition would have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nAll payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and other agencies. The Company could be required to return any payments received from U.S. government agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations. There have been no government audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations, although we can give no assurances. In addition, U.S. government contracts may be canceled at any time by the government with limited or no notice or penalty. Contract awards are also subject to funding approval from the U.S. government, which involves political, budgetary and other considerations over which the Company has no control.\nThe Companys security products are subject to export restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of State, which license the export of encryption products, subject to certain technical restrictions. In addition, U.S. export laws prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of hostile countries. Although to date the Company has been able to secure necessary U.S. government export licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to secure such licenses in a timely manner in the future, or at all.\nThe U.S. government controls, through a licensing process, the distribution of encryption technology and the sale of encryption products. The procedure for obtaining the applicable license from either the Department of Commerce or the Department of State, depending on the U.S. governments determination of jurisdiction, is well documented. The Company submits a license request application, which contains information pertaining to:\nthe type of equipment being sold;\ndetailed technical description (if required);\nthe buyer;\nthe end-user and use;\nquantity; and\ndestination location.\nThe appropriate departments of the U.S. government review the application and a licensing decision is provided to the Company. Pursuant to the receipt of the license, the Company may ship the product.\nMany of TCCs products can be sold under existing blanket licenses that have been obtained through a variant of the licensing process that approves products for sale to certain classes of customers, such as financial institutions, civilian government entities and commercial users. The Company has obtained blanket licenses for its secure telephone and office system products and its family of network encryptors. Licenses for sales of certain other products and/or to certain end users must be submitted for specific approval as described above. Although the U.S. government retains the right and ability to restrict product exports, the Company does not believe that U.S. government licensing will become more restrictive or an impediment to its business. The trend has been for the U.S. government to reduce the restrictions on the foreign sale of cryptographic equipment. TCC believes this trend is driven by the governments recognition of the technology available from foreign sources and the need to allow domestic corporations to compete in foreign markets. However, should the regulations become more restrictive, it would have a negative impact on the Companys international business, the impact of which could be material.\nThe costs and effects of compliance by the Company with applicable environmental laws during fiscal 2022 were, and historically have been, immaterial. In 2003, the European Union adopted the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC. In the event the Companys sales to Europe increase, the Company may have to incur additional costs to provide for the disposal of its products in compliance with that directive.\nManufacturing\nTCC has several manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers that provide outside processing of electronic circuit boards, fabrication of metal components, and supply of electronic components. For the majority of purchased materials and services, TCC has multiple suppliers that are able to deliver materials and services under short-term delivery purchase orders. Payment is typically made after delivery, based upon standard credit arrangements. For a small minority of parts, there are limited sources of supply. In such cases, TCC monitors source availability and usually stocks for anticipated long-term requirements to assure manufacturing continuity. Notwithstanding the Companys efforts to maintain material supplies, shortages can and do develop, resulting in delays in production, significant engineering development effort to find alternative solutions and, if production cannot be maintained, the discontinuation of the affected product design.\nThe Companys internal manufacturing process consists primarily of adding critical components, final assembly, system burn-in, quality control and testing. Delivery times vary depending on the products and options ordered.\nTechnological Expertise\nTCCs technological expertise and experience, including certain proprietary rights which it has developed and maintains as trade secrets, are crucial to the conduct of the Companys business. TCC has been designing and producing secure, cryptography-based communications systems for over 50 years, during which time the Company has developed many technological techniques and practices. This expertise and experience are in the areas of cryptographic algorithm design and implementation, key distribution and management systems, cryptographic processors, voice and fax encryption, and electronic hardware design. TCC relies on its internal technical expertise and experience, which TCC considers to be proprietary. These proprietary technologies are owned by TCC, are under TCCs control, and have been documented consistent with standard engineering practices. It is estimated that the majority of revenue during the past two years and during the next two years will be of products that are based upon TCC-proprietary designs.\nSuch technological experience and expertise are important as they enable an efficient design and development process. Loss of this experience and expertise would have an adverse impact on the Company. However, TCCs practices governing the internal documentation of design data mitigate some of the risk associated with the loss of personnel who are skilled in the core competencies described above.\nTCCs existing intellectual property portfolio includes a number of registered and unregistered trademarks; while eight patents have been issued to the Company, such patents have expired. Management is of the opinion that, while patent protection was desirable with respect to certain products, none of the Company's patents are currently material to the conduct of its business and the expiration of such patents is not expected to have any significant impact.\nTCC has an on-going technology license for communications protocol software used in the CipherONE family of Network Security System products. The license is royalty-based and runs without a specified termination date. The cost of this license is immaterial.\nWith the exception of the technology license referred to above, TCC has no material third party rights upon which the Company relies. Revenue from the sale of products associated with this license has not been and is not anticipated to be significant to the Companys revenues.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development efforts are undertaken by the Company primarily on its own initiative. In order to compete successfully, the Company must improve existing products and develop new products as well as attract and retain qualified personnel. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to hire and train such technical, management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company spent $817,000 and $732,000, respectively, on internal product development. The Company also spent $636,000 and $711,000 on billable development efforts during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the Companys total product development costs were $10,000 higher than fiscal 2021 levels and reflected the costs of custom development, product capability enhancements and production readiness. It is expected that product development expenses in fiscal 2023 will be consistent with fiscal 2022 levels.\nTechnical work continued to focus on three principal areas: development of solutions that meet the needs of OEMs; product enhancements that include expanded features, planned capability and applications growth; and custom solutions that tailor our products and services to meet the unique needs of our customers. Going forward, the Company expects to continue focusing technical efforts in these areas while also increasing our systems design and integration capabilities and services offering portfolio. The following are highlights of our product development efforts in fiscal 2022:\nCompleted the development of functional enhancements for the CX7211 digital data encryptor.\nCompleted the development of the aircraft-compatible, VOX HSE 6000 radio encryption product variants.\nProvision of custom engineering services for secure communications.\nForeign Operations\nThe Companys results of operations are dependent upon its foreign revenue, including domestic sales shipped to foreign end-users. Sales to foreign markets have been and will continue to be affected by, among other things, the stability of foreign governments, foreign and domestic economic conditions, export and other governmental regulations, and changes in technology. The Company attempts to minimize the financial risks normally associated with foreign sales by utilizing letters of credit confirmed by U.S. and foreign banks. Foreign sales contracts are usually denominated in U.S. dollars.\nThe Company utilizes the services of sales representatives, consultants and distributors in connection with foreign sales. Typically, representatives are paid commissions and consultants are paid fixed amounts on a stipulated schedule in return for services rendered. Distributors are granted discounted pricing.\nThe export from the United States of many of the Companys products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, or by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, as amended. The licensing process is discussed in more detail under the Regulatory Matters section above.\nIn fiscal years 2022 and 2021, sales directly to international customers accounted for approximately 24% and 13%, respectively, of our net revenue. Based on our historical results we expect that international revenue, including sales to domestic customers that ship to foreign end-users, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:\nchanges in regulatory requirements,\ndomestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements,\ndelays in placing orders,\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\nthe complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors,\nthe uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases,\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees,\nimposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions,\nthe difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries,\ncompliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, and\neconomic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances.\nWhile these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.\nWe also may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the U.S. government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments or other end-users.\nEmployees\nAs of September 24, 2022, the Company employed 19 full-time employees and two part-time employees, as well as several consultants. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.\nAvailable Information\nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, maintains an Internet site that contains current and periodic reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including TCC, that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Additional information about TCCs filings can also be obtained at our website at www.tccsecure.com under Investor Relations. We make available free of charge on our website the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The contents of our website are not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and should not be considered to be a part of, or incorporated into, this report. Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors that affect our business. Such risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are expressed or implied by forward-looking statements contained herein. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should also consider the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 and subsequent quarterly reports filed with the SEC.\nWe have suffered recurring operating losses from operations and there is doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor the year ended September 24, 2022, the Company generated a net loss of $2,331,000. For the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021, the Company generated a net loss of $1,088,000 and, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations during the prior seven year period from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018 and had an accumulated deficit of $6,485,000 at September 24, 2022. We anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity, including the recent line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our activities through January 2023. We may never achieve or sustain profitability. We must raise additional capital to pursue our development initiatives, penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe may not have sufficient cash to execute our business plan or sustain operations.\nWe used net cash in operations of $2,278,334 and $2,706,235 during fiscal years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively. At September 24, 2022, we had $6,727 in cash and cash equivalents. On August 4, 2022, Technical Communications Corporation (the Company) issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\nIn December 2022 the Company implemented a partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees. Although we have been able to and believe we will continue to be able to retain our employees and maintain all vital functions, it is likely that in a period of continued sustained disruption we would be forced to further furlough or terminate some or all of our employees.\nWe anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity, including the recent line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our activities through January 2023. We must raise additional capital to pursue our development initiatives, penetrate markets for the sale of our products and continue as a going concern. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital. If we are unable to secure additional capital, we may be required to curtail our research and development initiatives and take additional measures to reduce costs in order to conserve cash in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and meet our obligations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our business and may adversely affect our operations and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may have a significant and adverse impact on our business. The full extent to which COVID-19 will impact our operating results and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new medical and other information that may emerge concerning the virus and the actions by governmental entities or others to address and contain it.\nAs a result of COVID-19, many of our customers have curtailed their operations and as a result we are experiencing delays in orders. We believe these are only delays and that as we and our customers return to more normal operations these orders will be restored and future orders will resume on a more predictable basis, but we can make no assurances. While we have not experienced any significant supply problems and there have been no materially late deliveries of components or parts to date, it is possible that in a period of sustained disruption we may encounter problems in the manufacturing process or shortages in parts, components or other elements vital to the manufacture, production and sale of our products.\nFinally, we cannot be certain that we will have access to sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations for the time required to allow our customer operations to resume or normalize. Although we were able to secure loans under the Small Business Administrations Payroll Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan program during fiscal 2020, we may not be able to obtain additional funding on acceptable terms or at all, and any additional relief provided by lenders or governmental agencies may be insufficient to support our operations until business returns to normal.\nOur management has determined that the Companys disclosure control and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were not effective for fiscal year-end September 24, 2022.\nOur management team, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the Companys 2019 fiscal year. Management had concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to the misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles associated with revenue recognition, inventory reserves, accruals and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the classification and disclosure of financial information, all caused by a lack of adequate skills and experience within the accounting department. In addition, management identified a material weakness due to a lack of sufficient staff to segregate accounting duties, as well as a material weakness in internal control over significant non-routine transactions, all as disclosed in the relevant quarterly reports filed during our 2022 fiscal year. These conditions have led management to conclude that neither the Companys disclosure controls and procedures nor its internal control over financial reporting were effective at September 24, 2022.\nThe Company has made significant progress in improving its internal control over financial reporting but remediation efforts are ongoing; the Companys goal is to have all material weaknesses remediated in the early part of its 2023 fiscal year.\nAlthough we review and evaluate our internal control systems on a regular basis, we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in the future or that any corrective actions taken to remediate issues identified during the course of an assessment will be effective. Any such additional weaknesses could materially adversely affect our financial condition or ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements.\nOur quarterly operating results typically fluctuate and our future revenues and profitability are uncertain.\nWe have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results during the last several years and anticipate continued substantial fluctuations in our future operating results. A number of factors have contributed to these quarterly fluctuations, including but not limited to:\nforeign political unrest;\nbudgeting cycles of customers, including the U.S. government;\nintroduction and market acceptance of new products and product enhancements by us and our competitors;\ntiming and execution of individual contracts;\ncompetitive conditions in the communications security industry;\nchanges in general economic conditions; and\nshortfalls of revenues in relation to expectations that formed the basis for the calculation of fixed expenses.\nOur international operations expose us to additional risks.\nThe Company is dependent upon its foreign revenue (including domestic sales shipped to foreign end-users) and we expect that revenue to foreign end-users will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls, trade barriers and trade disputes, regulations related to customs and export/import matters, fluctuations in foreign economies and currency exchange rates, longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable, the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors, tax uncertainties and unanticipated tax costs due to foreign taxing regimes, the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries, the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights and differing legal systems generally, compliance with a variety of laws, and economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships, and military and political alliances.\nWe also may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad, including the export of many of the Companys products, and the U.S. government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments or certain international end-users. Export restrictions, compliance with which imposes additional burdens on the Company, may further provide a competitive advantage to foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products and services.\nWe continue to focus efforts in emerging markets, including the Middle East, Northern Africa and Southwest Asia. In many of these emerging markets, we may be faced with risks that are more significant than if we were to do business in developed countries, including undeveloped legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods and currency.\nWe continue to face a number of risks related to current global economic and political conditions that could unfavorably impact our business.\nGlobal economic conditions continue to be challenging for the secure communications markets, as many economies and financial markets remain in a recession resulting from a number of factors, including the impact of the pandemic, adverse credit conditions, low economic growth rates, continuing high rates of unemployment, and reduced corporate capital spending. Economic growth in many other countries has remained low and the length of time these adverse economic conditions may persist, including as a result of COVID-19, is unknown. In addition, conflicts in the Middle East and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets. These global economic and political conditions have impacted and will continue to impact our business in a number of ways, including:\nBudgeting and forecasting are difficult: It is difficult to estimate changes in various parts of the U.S. and world economy, including the markets in which we participate. Components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our products, and the prevailing economic and political uncertainties make estimating future income and expenditures difficult.\nPotential deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers: Uncertainty about current and future global economic and political conditions may cause, and in some cases has caused, governments and businesses to defer or cancel purchases. If future demand for our products declines due to deteriorating global economic and political conditions, it will negatively impact our financial results.\nCustomers' inability to obtain financing to make purchases: Some of our customers require substantial financing, including government financing, in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us. The inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit or other funds to finance purchases and/or meet their payment obligations could have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to respond to rapid technological changes in the markets in which we compete.\nThe markets for TCCs products and services are characterized by rapid technological developments, changing customer technological requirements and preferences, frequent new product introductions, enhancements and modifications, and evolving industry standards. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to correctly identify emerging technological trends, enhance capabilities, and develop and manufacture new technologies and products quickly, in a cost-effective manner, and at competitive prices. The development of new and enhanced products is a complex and costly process. We may need to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to develop and introduce such new products and enhancements. Our choices for developing technologies may prove incorrect if customers do not adopt the products we develop or if the technologies ultimately prove to be technically or commercially unviable. Development schedules also may be adversely affected as the result of the discovery of performance problems. If we fail to timely develop and introduce competitive new technologies, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nExisting or new competitors may develop competing or superior technologies.\nThe industry in which the Company competes is highly competitive, and the Company has several domestic and foreign competitors. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources, greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers. Competitors with greater financial resources can be more aggressive in marketing campaigns, can survive sustained price reductions in order to gain market share, and can devote greater resources to support existing products and develop new competing products. Any period of sustained price reductions for our products would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. TCC may not be able to compete successfully in the future and competitive pressures may result in price reductions, loss of market share or otherwise have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that competing products will emerge that may be superior in quality and performance and/or less expensive than those of the Company, or that similar technologies may render TCCs products obsolete or uncompetitive and prevent the Company from achieving or sustaining profitable operations.\nThe operating performance of our products is critical to our business and reputation.\nThe sale and use of our products entail a risk of product failure, product liability or other claims. Occasionally, some of our products have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product or the software used in the product. Often these issues are discovered prior to shipment and may result in shipping delays or even cancellation of orders by customers. Other times problems are discovered after the products have shipped, requiring us to resolve issues in a manner that is timely and least disruptive to our customers. Such pre-shipment and post-shipment problems have ramifications for TCC, including cancellation of orders, product returns, increased costs associated with product repair or replacement, and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation.\nOnce our products are in use, any product failure, including software or hardware failure, which causes a breach of security with respect to our customers confidential communications could have a material adverse effect on TCC. There is no guarantee of product performance or that our products are adequate to protect against all security breaches. While we attempt to mitigate such risks by maintaining insurance and including warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our arrangements with customers, such mitigation measures may not protect us against liability in all instances. If our products failed for any reason, our clients could experience data loss, financial loss, personal and property losses, harm to reputation, and significant business interruption. Such events may expose us to substantial liability, increased regulation and/or penalties, as well as loss of customer business and a diminished reputation. Any product liability claims and related litigation would likely be time-consuming and expensive, may not be adequately covered by insurance, and may delay or terminate research and development efforts, regulatory approvals and commercialization activities.\nIf our products and services do not interoperate with our end-users products, orders could be delayed or cancelled, which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nOur products are designed to interface with our end-users existing products, each of which have different specifications and utilizes multiple protocol standards. Many of our end-users systems contain multiple generations of products that have been added over time as these systems have grown and evolved. Our products and services must interoperate with all of these products and services as well as with future products and services that might be added to meet our end-users requirements. If our products do not interface with those within our end-users products and systems, orders for our products could be delayed or cancelled, which could significantly reduce our revenues.\nGovernment regulation and legal uncertainties could harm our business.\nAs a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company must comply with extensive regulations with respect to bid proposals and billing practices. Should the U.S. government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be canceled and the Company could be prohibited from bidding on or participating in future contracts. Moreover, payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment. The Company could be required to return any payments received from U.S. government agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations. There have been no government audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations, though we can give no assurances.\nThe Companys security products are subject to export restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of State, which license the export of encryption products, subject to certain technical restrictions. In addition, U.S. export laws prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of hostile countries and some end-users. Although to date the Company has been able to secure necessary U.S. government export licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to secure such licenses in a timely manner in the future, or at all. Delays in obtaining necessary approvals could be costly in terms of lost sales opportunities and compliance costs. Should export restrictions increase or regulations become more restrictive, or should new laws be enacted, it could have a negative impact on the Companys international business, which impact could be material.\nContracts with the U.S. government may not be fully funded at inception and are subject to termination.\nA portion of our revenues has historically been generated under agreements with the U.S. government. Any changes or delays in the budget of the U.S. government, and in particular defense spending, could affect our business, and funding levels are difficult to predict with any certainty. Moreover, certain multi-year contracts are conditioned on the continuing availability of appropriations. However, funds are typically appropriated on a fiscal-year basis, even though contract performance may extend over many years, making future sales and revenues under multi-year contracts uncertain. Changes in appropriations and budgets as well as economic conditions generally in subsequent years may impact the funding for these contracts. In addition, changes in funding and other factors may lead to the termination of such contracts. In addition, U.S. government contracts may be canceled at any time by the government with limited or no notice or penalty. Adverse changes in funding and the termination of government contracts could have a material adverse impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the protection of our intellectual property is inadequate, our competitors may gain access to our technologies.\nThe Companys technological expertise and experience, including certain proprietary rights that it has developed and maintains as trade secrets, are crucial to the conduct of the Companys business and its ability to compete in the marketplace. Such technological expertise and experience are important as they enable an efficient design and development process. Loss of this experience and expertise would have an adverse impact on the Company. To protect our proprietary information, we rely primarily on a combination of internal procedures, contractual provisions, and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Such internal procedures and contractual provisions may not prove sufficient to maintain the confidentiality and proprietary nature of such information and may not provide meaningful protection in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure. Trade secret and copyright laws afford only limited protection. Current and potential trademarks and patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage and patents and trademarks must be enforced and maintained in order to provide protection, which may prove costly and time-consuming.\nDespite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, we may not be successful in doing so or the steps taken by us may be inadequate to deter unauthorized parties from misappropriating our technologies or prevent them from obtaining and using our proprietary information, products and technologies. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or design around patents issued to us.\nOther parties may have patent rights relating to the same subject matter covered by our products or technologies, enabling them to prevent us from operating without obtaining a license and paying royalties. Third parties also may challenge our proprietary rights or claim we are infringing on their rights. Any claims of infringement or misappropriation, with or without merit, would likely be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and diversion of resources, and cause delays in the development and commercialization of our products. We may be required to expend significant resources to develop non-infringing intellectual property, pay royalties, or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation. Royalties may be costly and licenses, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, the absence of which could seriously harm our business.\nIn addition, the laws and enforcement mechanisms of some foreign countries with respect to intellectual property may not offer the same level of protection as do the laws of the United States. Legal protections of our rights may be ineffective in such countries, and technologies developed in such countries may not be protected in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available. Our inability to protect our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company relies on a small number of customers for a large percentage of its revenues.\nWe will be successful only if a significant number of customers adopt our secure communications products. Historically the Company has had a small number of customers representing a large percentage of its total revenue. Although the Company endeavors to expand its customer base, we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our revenues in any given period for the foreseeable future. This reliance makes us particularly susceptible to factors affecting those customers. If such customers business declines and as a result our sales to such customers decline without corresponding sales orders from other customers, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. It is difficult to predict the rate at which customers will use our products, even in the case of repeat customers, and we do not typically have long-term contractual arrangements.\nWe may not be able to maintain effective product distribution channels.\nWe rely on an in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors for the sale and distribution of our products. Our sales and marketing organization may be unable to successfully compete against more extensive and well-funded operations of certain of our competitors. In addition, we must manage sales and marketing personnel in numerous countries around the world with the concomitant difficulties in maintaining effective communications due to distance, language and cultural barriers. Further, certain of our distributors may carry competing products lines, which may negatively impact our net revenues.\nWe rely on single or limited sources for the manufacture and supply of certain product components.\nFor a small percentage of parts, we rely upon a single or limited number of manufacturers and suppliers. Moreover, because we depend on third party manufacturers and suppliers, we do not directly control product delivery schedules or component quality. In addition, we may not be able to maintain satisfactory contractual relations with our manufacturers and suppliers. A significant delay in delivering products to our customers, whether from unforeseen events such as the coronavirus, natural disasters or otherwise, or unforeseen quality issues could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we lose any of the manufacturers or suppliers of certain product components, we expect that it would take from three to six months for a new manufacturer or supplier to begin full-scale production of one of our products. The delay and expense associated with qualifying a new manufacturer or supplier and commencing production could result in a material loss of revenue and reduced operating margins and harm our relationships with customers. While we have not experienced any significant supply problems or problems with the quality of the manufacturing process of our suppliers and there have been no materially late deliveries of components or parts to date, it is possible that in the future we may encounter problems in the manufacturing process or shortages in parts, components or other elements vital to the manufacture, production and sale of our products.\nThe loss of existing key management and technical personnel and the inability to attract new hires could have a detrimental effect on the Company.\nOur success depends on identifying, hiring, training, and retaining qualified professionals. Competition for qualified employees in our industry is intense and made more difficult due to the historically tight labor market in Massachusetts, prior to the pandemic. We expect these conditions to remain so for the foreseeable future. If we were unable to attract and hire a sufficient number of employees, or if a significant number of our current employees or any of our senior managers resign, we may be unable to complete or maintain existing projects or bid for new projects of similar scope and revenue. The Companys success is particularly dependent on the retention of existing management and technical personnel, including Carl H. Guild, Jr., the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer. Although the Company has entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Guild, the loss or unavailability of his services could impede our ability to effectively manage our operations.\nWe may need to expand our operations and we may not effectively manage any future growth.\nAs of December 16, 2022, we employed 19 full-time and two part-time employees as well as several consultants. In the event our products and services obtain greater market acceptance, we may be required to expand our management team and hire and train additional technical and skilled personnel. We may need to scale up our operations in order to service our customers, which may strain our resources, and we may be unable to manage our growth effectively. If our systems, procedures, and controls are inadequate to support our operations, growth could be delayed or halted, and we could lose our opportunity to gain significant market share. In order to achieve and manage growth effectively, we must continue to improve and expand our operational and financial management capabilities. Any inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could interfere with the Companys operations and could compromise the Companys and its customers information, exposing the Company to liability that would cause the Companys business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company relies upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including collection of payments from purchasers of our products. The Company also uses information technology systems to record, process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes, and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including personally identifiable information of the Companys employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is material to the Companys business operations and strategy. Despite security measures, the Companys information technology networks and infrastructure may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error or malfeasance or other disruptions, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. The occurrence of any of these events could compromise the Companys networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, or other loss of information could result in legal claims, liability, and regulatory proceedings and penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, and damage the Companys reputation, which could adversely affect the Companys business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, the Company may need to invest additional resources to protect the security of its systems. Item 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. Item 2.\nPROPERTIES\nOn March 27, 2014, the Company entered into a lease commencing April 1, 2014 for its facility located at 100 Domino Drive, Concord, MA. The Company has been a tenant in this space since 1983. This is the Companys only facility and houses all manufacturing, research and development, and corporate operations. The initial term of the lease was for five years through March 31, 2019 at an annual rate of $171,000. In addition, the lease contains options to extend the lease for two and one half years through September 30, 2021 and another two and one half years through March 31, 2024 at an annual rate of $171,000. Rent expense for each of the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 was $171,000.

Item 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOur Company, on occasion, may become involved in legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are currently not aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us or our officers and directors in their capacity as such that could have a material impact on our operations or finances.

Item 6.\nRESERVED Item 7.\nMANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the Companys financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Companys audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe following discussion may contain statements that are not purely historical. Such statements contained herein or as may otherwise be incorporated by reference herein constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include but are not limited to statements regarding anticipated operating results, future earnings, and the ability to achieve growth and profitability. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (including its duration and severity) and governmental actions in response thereto; the effect of foreign political unrest; domestic and foreign government policies and economic conditions; future changes in export laws or regulations; changes in technology; the ability to hire, retain and motivate technical, management and sales personnel; the risks associated with the technical feasibility and market acceptance of new products; changes in telecommunications protocols; the effects of changing costs, exchange rates and interest rates; and the Company's ability to secure adequate capital resources. Such risks, uncertainties and other factors could cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company, or industry results, to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. For a more detailed discussion of the risks facing the Company, see the Companys filings with the SEC, including this Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 and the Risk Factors section included herein.\nImpact of COVID-19 Coronavirus\nAs a result of the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable delay in the receipt of customer orders. While we remain in contact with our customers and their requirements have not changed, the operations of certain of our customers have been slowed or shut down entirely. Our suppliers thus far have been able to timely deliver components and parts necessary for the manufacture and production of the Companys products to fulfill orders, although we cannot be sure this trend will continue. It is uncertain how long our customers operations will be impacted, and those of our suppliers and our ability to respond to customer requirements and supplier issues will become more challenging during a period of sustained disruption. Any period of sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The Companys significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation, to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, inventory reserves, receivable reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value and stock-based compensation. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and such differences may be material.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended September 24, 2022 compared to year ended September 25, 2021\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue for the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 was $1,304,000 and $1,866,000, respectively, a decrease of $562,000 or 30%. Revenue for fiscal 2022 consisted of $996,000, or 76%, from domestic sources and $308,000, or 24%, from international customers as compared to fiscal 2021, in which revenue consisted of $1,630,000, or 87%, from domestic sources and $237,000, or 13%, from international customers. International revenues continued to be impacted by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nForeign revenue consisted of shipments to three countries during the year ended September 24, 2022 and four countries during the year ended September 25, 2021. A sale is attributed to a foreign country based on the location of the contracting party. Domestic revenue may include the sale of products shipped through domestic resellers or manufacturers to international destinations. The table below summarizes our principal foreign revenue by country:\nMorocco\n$ 36,000\n$ 148,000\nEgypt\n-\n58,000\nSaudi Arabia\n80,000\n19,000\nPhilippines\n192,000\n12,000\n$ 308,000\n$ 237,000\nFor the year ended September 24, 2022, revenue was derived from sales of our engineering services amounting to $996,000 and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to one Far East country amounting to $192,000, a shipment of our internet protocol data encryptors amounting to $80,000 and some training provided to a North African country in the amount of $36,000.\nFor the year ended September 25, 2021, revenue was derived from sales of our engineering services amounting to $1,107,000 and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors and various accessories to one north African country amounting to $148,000 and three domestic customers for deployment into a Middle Eastern country amounting to $270,000, for deployment into a North African country amounting to $98,000 and for deployment into Afghanistan amounting to $77,000, and shipments of our internet protocol data encryptors amounting to $19,000.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for fiscal 2022 was $14,000, compared to gross profit of $557,000 for fiscal 2021, a decrease of 97%. Gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue was 1% for fiscal 2022 compared to 30% for fiscal 2021, which lower gross profit percentage for 2022 was due to the lower sales volume and higher concentration of lower margin engineering sales during the year.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 were $1,914,000, compared to $1,842,000 for fiscal 2021. This increase of $72,000, or 4%, was attributable to an increase in general and administrative expenses of $38,000 and an increase in selling and marketing expenses of $34,000 during the 2022 fiscal year.\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 24, 2022 was primarily attributable increases in payroll and payroll related expenses of $60,000, inspection and certification fees of $7,000, audit fees of $6,000 and outside consulting costs of $13,000 after a return to normal operations in the current period compared to the previous period where a temporary furlough was in place. These increases were partially offset by decreases in shareholder related costs of $19,000, legal fees of $14,000 and a decrease in insurance costs of $17,000 during the quarter.\nThe increase in selling and marketing expenses for the year ended September 24, 2022 was attributable to increases in payroll and payroll related expenses of $67,000 after a return to normal operations in the current quarter compared to the previous period where a temporary furlough was in place. Also contributing to the increase were increases in product demonstration costs of $30,000 and travel expenses of $19,000. Partially offsetting these increases were decreases to outside consulting costs of $25,000, commissions of $13,000 and product evaluation costs of $5,000. Also an increase in sales support activities has led to a decrease in selling and marketing expenses of $37,000, during the period.\nProduct Development Costs\nProduct development costs for fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were $817,000 and $732,000, respectively. This increase of $85,000, or 12%, was primarily attributable to an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses of $32,000 and an increase in project consulting and material costs of $29,000 during the period. In addition a decrease in billable engineering services contracts during fiscal 2022 resulted in increased product development costs of $24,000.\nThe Company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and development. The receipt of these orders is sporadic, although such programs can span over several months to several years. In addition to these programs, the Company invests in research and development to enhance its existing products or to develop new products, as it deems appropriate. There was $996,000 of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal 2022 and $1,107,000 of billable engineering services revenue generated during fiscal 2021.\nNet Loss\nThe Company generated a net loss of $2,331,000 for fiscal 2022, compared to a net loss of $1,088,000 for fiscal 2021. This increase in net loss is primarily attributable to a 97% decrease in gross profit during fiscal 2022, an increase of 6% in operating expenses and the forgiveness of two PPP loans amounting to $949,000, which reduced our net loss in fiscal 2021.\nThe effects of inflation and changing costs have not had a significant impact on revenue or earnings in recent years. As of September 24, 2022, none of the Companys monetary assets or liabilities was subject to foreign exchange risks. The Company usually includes an inflation factor in its pricing when negotiating multi-year contracts with customers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur cash and cash equivalents at September 24, 2022 totaled $7,000.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nFor the years ended September 24, 2022, September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company generated net losses of $2,331,139, $1,088,386 and $910,650 and, although the Company generated $631,426 of net income in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations during the prior seven year period from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,485,106 at September 24, 2022. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term year and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\nAlso on March 15, 2021, the Company ended its furlough plan instituted in December 2020 and all employees returned to work on a full time basis following the Companys receipt of the proceeds of its second PPP loan, described below. During the furlough, the Company had reduced the workweek for the majority of salaried employees to 24 hours and reduced salaries commensurately.\nIn December 2022 the Company implemented a partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees. This plan reduces the workweek to 24 hours and salaries have been reduced commensurately. With this furlough plan in place we anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our activities to January 2023. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations beyond that point, we will need to secure new customer contracts, raise additional equity or debt capital, and reduce expenses, including payroll and payroll-related expenses through another employee furlough and/or separations.\nIn order to have sufficient capital resources to fund operations, the Company has been working diligently to secure several large orders with new and existing customers. The receipt of these orders has been significantly delayed and will continue to be difficult to predict due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers as a result of their operations being reduced or shut down. TCC has been able to maintain its operations during this sustained period of disruption, but a continuation of the disruption in either our customers operations or those of the Company will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales activity and revenue.\nSince the start of the pandemic, the Company has been able to secure capital in the form of debt financing to assist with funding its operations. On April 17, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from bankHometown under the U.S. Small Business Administration's, or SBA, Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, in the principal amount of $474,400. The loan, which was evidenced by a note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on January 11, 2021.\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company received a second loan from bankHometown under the PPP as authorized under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, or the Economic Aid Act. The loan, evidenced by a promissory note, was in the principal amount of $474,405. The Company used the entire second PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the loan was forgiven on August 10, 2021 under the provisions of the Economic Aid Act.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company was granted a loan from the SBA in the principal amount of $150,000 pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. This loan is payable monthly over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 3.75% commencing thirty months from the date of issuance.\nThe Company is working diligently to secure additional capital through equity or debt arrangements in addition to the recent funding received from the SBA and Mr. Guild. The Company is actively working with equity investors as well as debt investors, such as the SBA and Mr. Guild to secure additional funding, although we cannot provide assurances we will be able to secure such new funding, especially in light of the tightening of the credit markets and continuing volatility of the capital markets as a result of the coronavirus. Moreover, the Companys common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market effective January 25, 2021; while our common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the change in listing may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the stock and the Companys ability to raise capital through offerings of its equity securities.\nShould the Company be unsuccessful in these efforts, it would be forced to implement headcount reductions, additional employee furloughs and/or reduced hours for certain employees, or cease operations completely.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe following table presents our abbreviated cash flows for the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021:\nNet loss\n$ (2,331,000\n)\n$ (1,088,000\n)\nChanges not affecting cash\n58,000\n(882,000 )\nChanges in current assets and current liabilities\n(5,000\n)\n(736,000\n)\nCash used in operating activities\n(2,278,000 )\n(2,706,000\n)\nCash used in investing activities\n(13,000\n)\n-\nCash provided by financing activities\n2,000,000\n1,490,000\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n(291,000 )\n(1,216,000\n)\nCash and cash equivalents - beginning of year\n298,000\n1,514,000\nCash and cash equivalents - end of year\n$ 7,000\n$ 298,000\nOperating Activities\nThe Company used approximately $428,000 less in cash from operations due to a decrease of $949,000 in forgiveness of PPP loans, the proceeds of which are included in financing activities on the Companys fiscal 2021 statement of cash flows, a net difference in the change in inventory of $446,000, a $412,000 in the change in accounts receivable, a $314,000 change in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a change in customer deposits of $75,000 offset by a receivable for Employee Retention Credits of $516,000 and a change in net loss of $1,243,000 in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities during fiscal 2022 increased by approximately $13,000. This increase was attributable to additions to equipment and leasehold improvements in 2022.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a result of proceeds from long-term debt, described below.\nDebt Instruments\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from bankHometown in the principal amount of $474,400 pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act. The loan, which was evidenced by a Note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on January 11, 2021.\nThe Company also was granted a loan by the SBA in August 2020. This loan is evidenced by a promissory note dated August 10, 2020 in the principal amount of $150,000 and was made under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program of the SBA. This note is payable monthly over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 3.75% commencing thirty months from the date of issuance.\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company was granted a second PPP loan from bankHometown in the principal amount of $474,405 under the Economic Aid Act. Any amounts not forgiven will be paid back over five years at an interest rate of 1% per year. Program rules provide that loan payments will be deferred for borrowers who apply for loan forgiveness until the SBA remits the borrower's loan forgiveness amount to the lender. If a borrower does not apply for loan forgiveness, payments are deferred for 10 months following the end of the covered period for the borrowers loan forgiveness (between 8 and 24 weeks). The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on August 10, 2021.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term year and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\nBacklog\nBacklog at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 amounted to $80,000 and $1,090,000, respectively. The orders in backlog at September 24, 2022 are expected to ship and/or services are expected to be performed over the next 12 months depending on customer requirements and product availability.\nPerformance guarantees\nCertain foreign customers require the Company to guarantee bid bonds and performance of products sold. These guaranties typically take the form of standby letters of credit. Guarantees are generally required in amounts of 5% to 10% of the purchase price and last in duration from three months to one year. At September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company had no outstanding letters of credit.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development efforts are undertaken by the Company primarily on its own initiative. In order to compete successfully, the Company must improve existing products and develop new products as well as attract and retain qualified personnel. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to hire and train such technical, management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company spent $817,000 and $732,000, respectively, on internal product development. The Company also spent $636,000 and $711,000 on billable development efforts during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2022, the Companys total product development costs were $10,000 higher than fiscal 2021 levels and reflected the costs of custom development, product capability enhancements and production readiness. It is expected that product development expenses in fiscal 2023 will be consistent with fiscal 2022 levels.\nCapital Expenditures\nOther than those stated above, there are no plans for material commitments for capital expenditures in fiscal 2023.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nAs a result of the current economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable delay in the receipt of customer orders. While we remain in contact with our customers and their requirements have not changed, the operations of certain of our customers have been slowed or shut down entirely. Our suppliers thus far have been able to timely deliver components and parts necessary for the manufacture and production of the Companys products to fulfill orders. However we cannot be sure this condition will continue and there is emerging evidence that certain parts are becoming more difficult to obtain and are adversely impacting delivery times. Nonetheless, the Company has been able to maintain its operations, and believes it will be in a strong position to respond to our customers needs as their operations return to normal, but can give no assurances. It is uncertain how long our and our customers operations will be impacted, and those of our suppliers, especially in light of recent increases in COVID-19 infection rates worldwide, and our ability to respond to customer requirements and supplier issues will become more challenging during a period of sustained disruption. Any period of sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to have sufficient capital resources to fund operations, the Company has been working diligently to secure several large orders with new and existing customers. The receipt of these orders has been significantly delayed and will continue to be difficult to predict due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers as a result of their operations being reduced or shut down. Without the near term receipt of these new orders the Company will have to secure other sources of financing such as debt or equity capital.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Item 7A.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. Item 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe financial statements and notes thereto listed in the accompanying index to financial statements (Item 15) are filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference. Item 9.\nCHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable. Item 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. The Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that review and evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 24, 2022 due to the material weaknesses described below.\nManagements annual report on internal control over financial reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 24, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on such an assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of September 24, 2022.\nOur internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nA goal of the assessment was to determine whether any material weaknesses existed with respect to the Companys internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the registrants annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Companys internal controls.\nBased upon that assessment management identified a deficiency that rose to the level of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to generally accepted accounting principles associated with revenue recognition caused by an error in judgement within the accounting department. The Company identified this material weakness at year end, but remediated those material weaknesses it had identified in prior years, as described below.\nAs disclosed in the Companys periodic and annual reports for prior periods through fiscal year end 2019, management had concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting due to material weaknesses in such internal control related to the misapplication of generally accepted accounting principles associated with revenue recognition, inventory reserves, accruals and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the classification and disclosure of financial information, all caused by a lack of adequate skills and experience within the accounting department. In addition, management also previously identified a material weakness due to a lack of sufficient staff to segregate accounting duties.\nNonetheless, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have certified that, based on such officers knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of, and for, the periods presented in this report. In addition, we initiated a remediation plan for the material weaknesses, described above.\nOur management, with oversight from the Audit Committee, actively engaged in remediating the identified material weaknesses. As part of these remediation efforts management undertook education and training for TCCs accounting staff and management to address certain core competencies that resulted in the lack of operational effectiveness. Management will continue to assess the design of controls to determine if enhancements are needed to increase effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Management has retained a subject matter expert in the area of income tax accounting and is assessing the need to retain additional subject matter experts to ensure compliance with generally accepted accounting principles and SEC rules and regulations. Both management and the Audit Committee have increased their oversight of non-routine transactions. This includes oversight of large revenue contracts as well as judgement areas, including inventory reserves and accruals. This oversight will contribute to the assessment of the need to retain additional subject matter experts.\nThe Company has made significant progress in improving its internal control over financial reporting but remediation efforts are ongoing; the Companys goal is to have all material weaknesses remediated in the early part of its 2022 fiscal year.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting. The changes in the aforementioned internal control over financial reporting and the remediation efforts undertaken as of year-end and undertaken in the fourth quarter of the Companys fiscal 2022 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. No other changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fourth quarter of its 2022 fiscal year.

its wholly-owned subsidiary, TCC Investment Corp., was organized in that jurisdiction in 1982. Technical Communications Corporation and TCC Investment Corp. are collectively referred to herein as the Company. The Companys business consists of only one industry segment, which is the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services. The secure communications solutions provided by TCC protect vital information transmitted over a wide range of data, video, fax and voice networks. TCCs products have been sold into over 115 countries and are in service with governments, military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions and multinational corporations.\nLiquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nFor the years ended September 24, 2022, September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company generated net losses of $2,331,139, $1,088,386 and $910,650 and, although the Company generated $631,426 of net income in the fiscal year ended September 28, 2019, the Company suffered recurring losses from operations during the prior seven year period from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2018. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $6,485,106 at September 24, 2022. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Such consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term year and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\nIn December 2022 the Company implemented a partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees. The plan reduces the workweek to 24 hours and salaries have been reduced commensurately. With this furlough plan in place we anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity, including the recent line of credit, will be sufficient to fund our activities through January 2023. In order to have sufficient cash to fund our operations beyond that point, we will need to secure new customer contracts, raise additional equity or debt capital, and reduce expenses, including payroll and payroll-related expenses through another employee furlough and/or separations.\nIn order to have sufficient capital resources to fund operations, the Company has been working diligently to secure several large orders with new and existing customers. The receipt of these orders has been significantly delayed and will continue to be difficult to predict due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers as a result of their operations being reduced or shut down. TCC has been able to maintain its operations during this sustained period of disruption, but a continuation of the disruption in either our customers operations or those of the Company will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales activity and revenue.\nSince the start of the pandemic, the Company has been able to secure capital in the form of debt financing to assist with funding its operations. On April 17, 2020, the Company was granted a loan from bankHometown under the U.S. Small Business Administration's, or SBA, Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, in the principal amount of $474,400. The loan, which was evidenced by a note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire original PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the SBA forgave the loan in its entirety on January 11, 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company received a second loan from bankHometown under the PPP as authorized under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act, or the Economic Aid Act. The loan, evidenced by a promissory note, was in the principal amount of $474,405. The Company used the entire second PPP loan amount for qualifying expenses and the loan was forgiven on August 10, 2021 under the provisions of the Economic Aid Act.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company was granted a loan from the SBA in the principal amount of $150,000 pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. This loan is payable monthly over 30 years at an annual interest rate of 3.75% commencing thirty months from the date of issuance.\nThe Company is working diligently to secure additional capital through equity or debt arrangements in addition to the recent funding received from the SBA and Mr. Guild. The Company is actively working with equity investors as well as debt investors, such as the SBA and Mr. Guild to secure additional funding, although we cannot provide assurances we will be able to secure such new funding, especially in light of the tightening of the credit markets and continuing volatility of the capital markets as a result of the coronavirus. Moreover, the Companys common stock was delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market effective January 25, 2021; while the common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, the change in listing may have a negative impact on the liquidity of the stock and the Companys ability to raise capital through offerings of its equity securities.\nShould the Company be unsuccessful in these efforts, it would be forced to implement headcount reductions, additional employee furloughs and/or reduced hours for certain employees, or cease operations completely.\n(2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe Company follows accounting standards set by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, commonly referred to as the FASB. The FASB sets generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) that the Company follows to ensure it consistently reports its financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. References to GAAP issued by the FASB in these footnotes are to the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationTM, sometimes referred to as the Codification or ASC.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of TCC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, TCC Investment Corp., a Massachusetts corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant judgments and estimates include those related to revenue recognition, receivable reserves, inventory reserves, impairment of long-lived assets, income taxes, fair value and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include demand deposits at banks and other investments (including mutual funds) readily convertible into cash. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts and money market mutual funds that, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on its cash, cash equivalents or marketable securities. The Company accounts for marketable securities in accordance with FASB ASC 320, Investments-Debt and Equity Securities.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that management believes may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. When the financial condition of the Companys customers deteriorates, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances are recorded. In addition, if the Company becomes aware of a customers inability to meet its financial obligations to TCC, a specific write-off is recorded in that amount. There was no allowance for doubtful accounts at September 24, 2022 or September 25, 2021.\nInventories\nThe Company values its inventory at the lower of actual cost (based on the first-in, first-out method) to purchase and/or manufacture and net realizable value (based on estimated selling prices, less the cost to sell) of the inventory. The Company periodically reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and/or obsolete inventory based primarily on its estimated forecast of product demand, as well as historical usage. The Company evaluates the carrying value of inventory on a quarterly basis to determine if the carrying value is recoverable at estimated selling prices. To the extent that estimated selling prices are less than the associated carrying values, inventory carrying values are written down. In addition, the Company makes judgments as to future demand requirements and compares those with the current or committed inventory levels. Reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed the Companys judgment of future demand. It is possible that additional reserves above those already established may be required in the future if market conditions for the Companys products should deteriorate.\nEquipment and Leasehold Improvements\nEquipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in operations for the period. The costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Companys only long-lived assets are equipment and leasehold improvements. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. These events include a significant decrease in the market price of a long-lived asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long-lived asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long-lived asset, including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long-lived asset, a current-period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses, or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long-lived asset, among other items. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by such asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no events or changes in circumstances that required the Company to review long-lived assets for impairment during fiscal years 2022 and 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Companys engineering services revenue is derived from performing funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how actual costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts that are expected to exceed one year in duration, revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. The Company may receive periodic progress payments and it retains the rights to the intellectual property developed in government contracts.\nThe Company recognizes equipment sales revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the fee is fixed or determinable, delivery of the product and passage of title to the customer has occurred and the Company has determined that collection of the fee is probable. Title to the product generally passes upon shipment of the product, as the products are shipped freight on board shipping point, except for certain foreign shipments for which title passes upon entry of the product into the first port in the buyers country. If the product requires installation to be performed by TCC or other acceptance criteria exist, all revenue related to the product is deferred and recognized upon completion of the installation or satisfaction of the customer acceptance criteria. The Company provides for a warranty reserve at the time the product revenue is recognized.\nAll payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to audit and adjustment by the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the U.S. Government Accountability Office and other agencies. Adjustments are recognized in the period made. There have been no audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations\nCosts incurred in connection with funded research and development are included in cost of revenue. Product development costs are charged to billable engineering services, bid and proposal efforts or business development activities, as appropriate. Product development costs charged to billable projects are recorded as cost of revenue; engineering costs charged to bid and proposal efforts are recorded as selling expenses; and product development costs charged to business development activities are recorded as marketing expenses.\nProduct development costs consist primarily of costs associated with personnel, outside contractor and engineering services, supplies and materials. Cost of product revenue includes material, labor and overhead.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset/liability method. Under the asset/liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized at current income tax rates to reflect the tax effect of temporary differences between the consolidated financial reporting basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company provides a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value.\nThe Company follows the appropriate guidance relative to uncertain tax positions. This standard provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition, measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in the financial statements. Uncertain tax positions must meet a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. There were no uncertain tax positions as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nWarranty Costs\nThe Company provides for estimated warranty costs at the time product revenue is recognized based upon historical experience.\nFair Value of Financial Measurements\nThe Companys available for sale securities consist of money market mutual funds held in a brokerage account, which are classified as cash equivalents and measured at fair value.\nAs of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, the Company did not hold any assets classified as Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3. There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share (EPS)\nThe Company presents both a basic and a diluted EPS. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. In computing diluted EPS, stock options that are dilutive (i.e., those that reduce earnings per share) are included in the calculation of EPS using the treasury stock method. The exercise of outstanding stock options is not included if the result would be antidilutive, such as when a net loss is reported for the period or the option exercise price is greater than the average market price for the period presented.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are included in product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred and were $816,633 and $732,020 in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts are accounted for as contract costs as the work is performed and included in cost of revenue; such amounts were $636,318 and $711,335 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nFiscal Year-End Policy\nThe Companys by-laws call for its fiscal year to end on the Saturday closest to the last day of September, unless otherwise decided by its Board of Directors. The 2022 fiscal year ended on September 24, 2022 and included 52 weeks. The 2021 fiscal year ended on September 25, 2021 and included 52 weeks.\nReclassification\nCertain reclassifications have been made to the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2021 to conform with the fiscal year 2022 presentation.\nSBA Payroll Protection Program Loan\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company adopted IAS 20 - Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance (IAS 20) to account for the receipt of the loan under the SBAs Payroll Protection Program. IAS 20 requires the loan to be recognized as deferred income. Derecognition of the liability for any portion of the loan that is forgivable or has been forgiven will occur only when there is a reasonable assurance any conditions attached to the assistance will be met. The income statement effect for the portion of the loan that is forgivable or has been forgiven will consist of either (1) a credit in the income statement, either separately or under a general heading such as other income, or (2) a reduction of the related expenses, as the entity recognizes the related cost to which the loan relates. The Company has elected to treat the forgiven part of the loan as other income. As the Company used 100% (minimum requirement is 75%) of the loan proceeds to cover its payroll expenses during the Alternate Covered Period, the full amount of the loans were forgiven.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecent accounting pronouncements were issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) and the SEC during the Companys 2022 fiscal year but such pronouncements are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future financial statements.\n(3) Revenue\nThe following table presents the Companys revenues disaggregated by revenue type for the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\nRevenue type:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nEngineering services\n$ 995,833\n$ 1,106,709\nEquipment sales\n308,102\n759,670\nTotal sales\n$ 1,303,935\n$ 1,866,379\nEngineering services revenue consists of funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies primarily under fixed-price contracts. The Company also derives revenue from developing and designing custom cryptographic solutions for customers unique secure voice, data and video communications requirements and integrating such solutions into existing systems. These contracts can vary but typically call for fixed monthly payments or payments due upon meeting certain milestones. Customers are billed monthly or upon achieving the milestone, and payments are due on a net basis after the billing date.\nEquipment sales revenue consists of sales of communications security equipment for voice, data, facsimile and video networks for military, government and corporate/industrial applications. Equipment sales are billed to the customer upon shipment with typical payment terms requiring a down payment at the time of order with the balance due prior to shipment. For government and certain long term customers, the Company may grant net payment terms.\n(4) Net Loss Per Share\nOutstanding potentially dilutive stock options, which were not included in the net loss per share amounts as their effect would have been anti-dilutive, were 164,900 and 143,900 shares in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n(5) Stock Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the calculated fair value of the award. The expense is recognized over the employees requisite service period, generally the vesting period of the award. The related excess tax benefit received upon the exercise of stock options, if any, is reflected in the Companys statement of cash flows as an operating activity. There were no excess tax benefits for the fiscal years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as the method for determining the estimated fair value of its stock option awards. The Black-Scholes method of valuation requires several assumptions: (1) the expected term of the stock award, (2) the expected future stock price volatility over the expected term, (3) a risk-free interest rate and (4) the expected dividend rate. The expected term represents the expected period of time the Company believes the options will be outstanding based on historical information. Estimates of expected future stock price volatility are based on the historic volatility of the Companys common stock and the risk free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury Note rate. The Company utilizes a forfeiture rate based on an analysis of its actual experience. The forfeiture rate is not material to the calculation of stock-based compensation.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe fair value of options at date of grant was estimated with the following assumptions:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nAssumptions:\nOption life (years)\n6.5\n6.5\nRisk-free interest rate\n2.0\n%\n0.7\n%\nStock volatility\n%\n%\nDividend yield\n%\n%\nThere were 28,000 options granted during the fiscal year ended September 24, 2022 and no options were granted during the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year September 24, 2022 was $1.54. The following table summarizes stock-based compensation costs included in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021:\nSelling, general and administrative\n$ 43,776\n$ 43,292\nProduct development\n7,942\n9,112\nTotal stock-based compensation expense before taxes\n$ 51,718\n$ 52,404\nAs of September 24, 2022, there was $89,090 of unrecognized compensation expense related to options outstanding. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over the remaining requisite service period. As of September 24, 2022, the weighted average period over which the compensation expense is expected to be recognized 2.9 years.\nOn May 6, 2021 the Company adopted the 2021 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan). The Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 300,000 shares. The Plan has not been approved by shareholders and allows for non-qualified stock option grants, stock appreciation rights (SARS), restricted stock and stock units and other stock and stock based awards. There were 28,000 options granted under this Plan during the year ended September 24, 2022. Vesting periods are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and typically range between zero and five years. Options under the Plan are granted with an exercise price equal to fair value at time of grant and have a term of ten years from the date of grant.\nThe Technical Communications Corporation 2005 Non-Statutory Stock Option Plan and 2010 Equity Incentive Plan are expired as of September 24, 2022 and options are no longer available for grant thereunder, although vested, unexercised options under such plans remain outstanding. There were an aggregate of 600,000 shares authorized for issuance under these plans, of which options to purchase 136,900 shares were outstanding at September 24, 2022. Vesting periods are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and typically range between zero and five years. Options under these plans are granted with an exercise price equal to fair value at time of grant and have a term of ten years from the date of grant.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following tables summarize stock option activity during fiscal years 2021 and 2022:\nOptions Outstanding\nNumber of Shares\nWeighted Average\nWeighted Average\nContractual Life\nUnvested\nVested\nTotal\nExercise Price\n(years)\nOutstanding, September 26, 2020\n71,600\n86,300\n157,900\n$ 4.54\n6.54\nGrants\n-\n-\n-\n-\nVested\n(21,900\n)\n21,900\n-\n3.32\nExercises\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCancellations/forfeitures\n(1,200\n)\n(12,800\n)\n(14,000\n)\n8.92\nOutstanding, September 25, 2021\n48,500\n95,400\n143,900\n$ 4.11\n5.97\nGrants\n28,000\n-\n28,000\n1.75\nVested\n(19,800\n)\n19,800\n-\n3.37\nExercises\n-\n-\n-\n-\nCancellations/forfeitures\n-\n(7,000\n)\n(7,000\n)\n10.20\nOutstanding, September 24, 2022\n56,700\n108,200\n164,900\n$ 3.45\n5.98\nInformation related to the stock options vested or expected to vest as of September 24, 2022 is as follows:\nRange of\nExercise Prices\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nLife (years)\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise Price\nExercisable\nNumber of\nShares\nExercisable\nWeighted-\nAverage\nExercise Price\n$1.01 - $2.00\n48,000\n8.57\n$\n1.80\n12,000\n$\n1.87\n$2.01 - $3.00\n34,300\n5.42\n2.61\n25,900\n2.65\n$3.01 - $4.00\n43,500\n6.59\n3.60\n33,300\n3.60\n$4.01 - $5.00\n16,600\n1.75\n4.34\n16,600\n4.33\n$5.01 - $10.00\n22,500\n3.27\n7.36\n20,400\n7.37\n164,900\n5.98\n$ 3.45\n108,200\n$ 4.00\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of the Companys in-the-money outstanding and exercisable options was $0 as of September 24, 2022 and $14,226 as of September 25, 2021. There were no stock options exercised during the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021. Nonvested common stock options are subject to the risk of forfeiture until the fulfillment of specified conditions.\n(6) Inventories\nInventories consist of the following:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nFinished goods\n$ -\n$ 57,006\nWork in process\n489,854\n487,276\nRaw materials and supplies\n476,331\n613,100\nTotal inventories\n$ 966,185\n$ 1,157,382\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n(7) Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nEquipment and leasehold improvements consist of the following:\nSeptember 24,\nSeptember 25,\nEstimated\nUseful Life (years)\nEngineering and manufacturing equipment\n$ 2,162,241\n$ 2,149,280\n-\nDemonstration equipment\n834,137\n834,137\nFurniture and fixtures\n1,015,816\n1,015,816\n-\nAutomobile\n49,441\n49,441\nLeasehold improvements\n494,509\n494,509\nLesser of useful life or term of lease\nTotal equipment and leasehold improvements\n4,556,144\n4,543,183\nLess accumulated depreciation and amortization\n(4,544,778\n)\n(4,538,782\n)\nEquipment and leasehold improvements, net\n$ 11,366\n$ 4,401\nDepreciation expense was $5,996 and $14,328 for the fiscal years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.\n(8) Leases\nThe Company leases space from a third party for all manufacturing, research and development, and corporate operations. The initial term of the lease was for five years through March 31, 2019 at an annual rate of $171,000. In addition, the lease contains options to extend the lease for two and one-half years through September 30, 2021 and another two and one-half years through March 31, 2024 at an annual rate of $171,000. In September 2018, the Company exercised its option to extend the term of the lease through September 2021. The Company exercised the option on March 31, 2021, and the new term will run until March 30, 2024. As such, the Company uses the extended lease term in its calculation of the lease liability and right-of-use asset. The Company classifies this lease as an operating lease with the costs recognized as a selling, general and administrative expense in its consolidated statements of operations. The lease expense for each of the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021 was approximately $171,000.\nThe table below presents the maturity of the Companys operating lease liability as of September 24, 2022:\n170,603\n85,301\nTotal lease payments\n255,904\nLess: Imputed interest\n(7,442\n)\nTotal lease liability\n$ 248,462\n(9) Debt\nOn April 17, 2020, the Company was granted an initial PPP loan from bankHometown in the principal amount of $474,400 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). The loan, which was evidenced by a Note dated April 17, 2020, was payable over 18 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses and the loan was forgiven in its entirety on January 11, 2021. The AICPA and the SEC Office of the Chief Accountant have indicated that a borrower may elect to account for a PPP loan as a government grant in substance by applying the guidance in IAS 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance by analogy if it is probable that it will meet both (a) the eligibility criteria for a PPP loan, and (b) the loan forgiveness criteria for all or substantially all of the PPP loan. The Company has elected to adopt this method of accounting for this PPP loan under IAS 20, and has recognized the loan forgiveness as grant income for the full amount of the loan.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nOn August 10, 2020, the Company also was granted a loan (the SBA Loan) from the SBA in the principal amount of $150,000 pursuant to the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. The SBA Loan, which is evidenced by a Promissory Note dated August 10, 2020, is payable in monthly installments of $731, including principal and interest, over 30 years at an interest rate of 3.75% per year. The SBA Loan may be prepaid by the Company at any time prior to maturity with no prepayment penalties. The proceeds from this loan must be used solely as working capital to alleviate economic injury caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Although originally repayable commencing one year after grant, on March 15, 2022 the SBA announced that payments on the SBA Loan would be deferred an additional six months. Payments on the loan will now commence on February 10, 2023.\nAs part of the SBA Loan, the Company granted the SBA a continuing security interest in and to any and all Collateral to secure payment and performance of all debts, liabilities and obligations of the Company to the SBA under the SBA Loan. The Collateral includes all tangible and intangible personal property that the Company owns or acquires or creates immediately upon the acquisition or creation thereof, including, but not limited to: (a) inventory, (b) equipment, (c) instruments, including promissory notes, (d) chattel paper, including tangible chattel paper and electronic chattel paper, (e) documents, (f) letter of credit rights, (g) accounts, including health-care insurance receivables and credit card receivables, (h) deposit accounts, (i) commercial tort claims, (j) general intangibles, including payment intangibles and software, and (k) as-extracted collateral, in each case as such terms may from time to time be defined in the Uniform Commercial Code.\nThe aggregate amounts of principal maturities of long-term debt for the following fiscal years are:\n$ 1,996\n3,089\n3,207\n3,329\n3,739\nThereafter\n134,640\n$ 150,000\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company received a second PPP loan from bankHometown as authorized under the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the Economic Aid Act). The loan, which was evidenced by a promissory note, is in the principal amount of $474,405 was payable over 60 months at an annual interest rate of 1% to the extent not forgiven. The Company used the entire loan amount for qualifying expenses and the loan was forgiven in its entirety on August 30, 2021 under the provisions of the Economic Aid Act.\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term year and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of approximately $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\n(10) Warranty\nThe Company's products generally carry a standard 15 month warranty. The Company records a reserve based on anticipated warranty claims at the time product revenue is recognized. Factors that affect the Company's product warranty liability include the number of installed units, the anticipated cost of warranty repairs and historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims. The warranty reserve is included in other current liabilities on the balance sheet.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following table reflects changes in the Company's accrued warranty account:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nBeginning balance\n$ 13,764\n$ 28,211\nPlus: accruals related to new sales\n1,174\n2,290\nLess: payments and adjustments to prior period accruals\n(13,519\n)\n(16,737\n)\nEnding balance\n$ 1,419\n$ 13,764\n(11) Income Taxes\nThe income tax expense (benefit) is different from what would be obtained by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income (loss) before income taxes due to the following:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\nTax expense (benefit) at U.S. statutory rate\n$ (489,072\n)\n(21.0\n)%\n$ (228,561\n)\n(21.0\n)%\nState income tax provision, net of federal benefit\n(125,112\n)\n(5.4\n)%\n(104,451\n)\n(9.6\n)%\nFederal research credits\n-\n-\n-\n-\nChange in state income tax rate\n(32,518\n)\n(1.4\n)%\n(160,738\n)\n(14.8\n)%\nOther\n13,241\n0.6\n%\n(105,280\n)\n(9.6\n)%\nValuation allowance\n633,461\n27.2\n%\n599,030\n55.0\n%\nTotal income tax expense (benefit)\n$ -\n-\n$ -\n-\nDeferred income taxes consist of the following:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nInventory differences\n$ 1,054,281\n$ 1,046,749\nNet operating losses\n3,407,197\n2,789,142\nStock based compensation\n138,736\n133,173\nTax credits\n539,421\n516,542\nOther\n49,617\n70,168\nTotal\n5,189,252\n4,555,791\nLess: valuation allowance\n(5,189,252\n)\n(4,555,791\n)\nTotal\n$ -\n$ -\nDuring fiscal year 2014, the Company established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance is related to uncertainty with respect to the Companys ability to realize its deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carryforwards, tax credits, inventory differences and other temporary differences. During fiscal years 2022 and 2021, the change in the valuation allowance was $633,461 and $599,030, respectively and related primarily to changes in net operating losses.\nDue to the nature of the Companys current operations in foreign countries (selling products into these countries with the assistance of local representatives), the Company has not been subject to any foreign taxes in recent years. Also, it is not anticipated that the Company will be subject to foreign taxes in the near future.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in the states of Massachusetts and New Hampshire. For U.S. federal and state purposes, the tax years 2018 through 2021 remain open to examination. In addition, the amount of the Companys federal and state net operating loss carryforwards utilized in prior periods may be subject to examination and adjustment. The Company has federal research credits of $365,897 available through fiscal year 2040 and net operating loss carryforwards of $5,859,642 available through fiscal year 2039 and the net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal years 2022 through 2019 of $7,276,985 will carryforward indefinitely. In addition, the Company has Massachusetts research credits of $189,318 available through fiscal year 2036 and net operating loss carryforwards of $11,633,242 available through fiscal year 2041.\nUnder the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) the Company is entitled to Employee Retention Credits for parts of its fiscal 2020 and 2021 years. The Company has filed amended Employers Quarterly Federal Tax returns to apply for these credits. As a result the Company is due $515,966 in credits and expects to receive refunds from the IRS in fiscal 2023.\n(12) Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company has a qualified, contributory, profit sharing plan covering substantially all employees. The Companys policy is to fund contributions as they are accrued. The contributions are allocated based on the employees proportionate share of total compensation. The Companys contributions to the plan are determined by the Board of Directors and are subject to other specified limitations. There were no Company profit sharing contributions during fiscal years 2022 or 2021. The Company's matching contributions were $73,824 and $56,435 in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company has an Executive Incentive Bonus Plan for the benefit of key management employees. The bonus pool is determined based on the Companys performance as defined by the plan. Under the plan, there were no bonuses earned, accrued or paid to eligible employees at September 24, 2022 or September 25, 2021.\n(13) Major Customers and Export Revenue\nIn fiscal year 2022, the Company had two customers representing 91% (76% and 15%) of total net revenue and at September 24, 2022 had one customer representing 100% of accounts receivable. In fiscal year 2021, the Company had two customers representing 74% (59% and 15%) of total net revenue and at September 25, 2021 had one customer representing 97% of accounts receivable.\nA breakdown of net revenue is as follows:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nDomestic\n$ 995,833\n$ 1,629,824\nForeign\n308,102\n236,555\nTotal Revenue\n$ 1,303,935\n$ 1,866,379\nA summary of foreign sales, as a percentage of total foreign revenue, by geographic area, is as follows:\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nFar East\n62.3\n%\n5.0\n%\nMid-East and Africa\n37.7\n%\n95.0\n%\nThe Company sold products to customers located in three countries during the year ended September 24, 2022 and to customers located in four countries during the year ended September 25, 2021. A sale is attributed to a foreign country based on the location of the contracting party. Domestic revenue may include the sale of products shipped through domestic resellers or manufacturers to international destinations. The table below summarizes the Companys foreign revenues by country as a percentage of total foreign revenue.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSeptember 24, 2022\nSeptember 25, 2021\nPhilippines\n62.3\n%\n5.0\n%\nSaudi Arabia\n25.9\n%\n8.0\n%\nMorocco\n11.8\n%\n62.5\n%\nEgypt\n-\n24.5\n%\n(14) Related Party Transactions\nOn August 4, 2022, the Company issued an amended and restated demand promissory note in the principal amount of up to $4,000,000 in favor of Carl H. Guild, Jr. Mr. Guild, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Board, loaned the money to the Company to provide working capital. The $4,000,000 consists of $1,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 6% and $2,000,000 previously loaned to the Company at an interest rate of 7.5% and an additional $1,000,000 at an interest rate of 7.5%. The additional funds will be available to the Company to borrow from Mr. Guild on a revolving basis and the loan has no specified term year and may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The outstanding principal balance at September 24, 2022 was $3,000,000, plus accrued interest of $106,000. An interest payment of $30,000 was made in January of 2022.\nOn July 15, 2021 there was a sale by the Company of 4,000 unregistered shares of the Companys common stock at $4.00 per share to a member of the Board of Directors.\n(15) Shareholder Rights Plan\nOn August 7, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a Stockholder Rights Plan to replace the Company's former plan, which had expired on August 5, 2014. The new plan is substantially similar to the former plan, and was not adopted in response to any specific takeover threat. In adopting the plan, the Board declared a dividend distribution of one common stock purchase right for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company, payable to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2014. Until the rights become exercisable, which occurs with certain exceptions when a person or affiliated group acquires 15% or more of TCC's common stock, they will trade automatically with the common stock and separate rights certificates will not be issued. Each right, once exercisable, will entitle the holder (other than rights owned by the acquiring person or group) to buy one share of the common stock at a price of $25 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The rights can generally be redeemed by the Company at $.001 per right at any time prior to the close of business on the tenth business day after there has been a public announcement of the acquisition of beneficial ownership by any person or group of 15% or more of the Companys outstanding common stock, subject to certain exceptions. The rights will expire on August 6, 2024 unless earlier redeemed.\n(16) Impact of COVID-19 Coronavirus\nAs a result of the economic slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a noticeable delay in the receipt of customer orders. While we remain in contact with our customers and their requirements have not changed, the operations of certain of our customers have been slowed or shut down entirely. Our suppliers thus far have been able to timely deliver components and parts necessary for the manufacture and production of the Companys products to fulfill orders, although we cannot be sure this trend will continue. While the Company was able to reopen its facility in June 2020 after a brief government-mandated shutdown, we believe it is possible that new restrictions may be imposed in the near future. In December 2020 the Company implemented a partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees and all employees returned to work on a full time basis following the Companys receipt of the proceeds of its second PPP loan. In December of 2022 the Company implemented a new partial furlough plan for the majority of salaried employees. With this furlough plan in place we anticipate that our principal sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund activities to January 2023. It is uncertain how long our customers operations will be impacted, and those of our suppliers and our ability to respond to customer requirements and supplier issues will become more challenging during a period of sustained disruption. Any period of sustained disruption would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Technical Communications Corporation:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Technical Communications Corporation and Subsidiary (the Company) as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years ended September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt About the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit, has suffered significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations and has limited working capital that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. We have determined that there are no critical audit matters to report.\n/s/ Stowe & Degon LLC\nWestborough, Massachusetts\nDecember 22, 2022\nWe have served as the Companys auditors since 2019."
