We utilize a blend of internal and outsourced manufacturing processes and capabilities to fulfill a variety of customer needs in the most cost-effective manner. Our investment in our production facilities is focused primarily on improving capabilities, product quality, and manufacturing efficiency as well as environmental, health, and safety compliance. We also utilize contract manufacturing from U.S., Asian, and European sources for certain products. The following table shows the percentage of finished goods manufactured and purchased in fiscal 2022 by significant geographic region.\nManufactured Purchased Total\nUnited States 14 % 9 % 23 %\nMexico 56 % - % 56 %\nAsia - % 16 % 16 %\nOthers 5 % - % 5 %\nTotal 75 % 25 % 100 %\nWe operate seven manufacturing facilities in Mexico, some of which are authorized to operate as Maquiladoras by the Ministry of Economy of Mexico. Maquiladora status allows us to import raw materials into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the Maquiladora program and other local regulations, which have become stricter in recent years.\nLighting and building technology solutions are delivered to our customers through a network of strategically located distribution centers, regional warehouses, and commercial warehouses in North America or directly to our customers from manufacturing facilities using both common carriers and a company-managed truck fleet. For international customers, distribution methods are adapted to meet individual customer or country requirements. During fiscal 2022, net sales initiated outside of the U.S. represented approximately 13% of total net sales. See the Supplemental Disaggregated Information footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the geographic distribution of net sales, operating profit, and long-lived assets.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (R&D) is defined as the critical investigation aimed at discovery of new knowledge and the conversion of that knowledge into the design of a new product or significant improvement to an existing product or service. We invest in product vitality, including enhancement of existing offerings, with a focus on improving the performance-to-cost ratio and energy efficiency as well as redesigning products based on component availability. We also develop software applications and capabilities to enhance data analytics offerings for building performance, enterprise operations, and personal experiences. R&D expenses consist of compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, and other administrative costs, but the amounts do not include all new product development costs. For fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, R&D expenses totaled $95.1 million, $88.3 million, and $82.0 million, respectively.\nSales and Marketing\nSales\nWe sell lighting and building technology solutions to customers utilizing numerous sales forces, including internal direct salespeople and independent sales agencies, based on the channel and geography served. We also operate an international sales group coordinating export sales outside of North America.\nSee the Segment Information, Revenue Recognition, and Supplemental Disaggregated Information footnotes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information concerning our sales by segment, type, and geography.\nMarketing\nWe market our product portfolio and service capabilities to customers and/or end users in multiple channels through a broad spectrum of marketing and promotional methods, including direct customer contact, trade shows, on-site training, print and digital advertising in industry publications, product brochures, and other literature, as well as through digital marketing and social media. We operate training and education facilities in several locations throughout North America and Europe designed to enhance the lighting knowledge of customers and industry professionals.\nIndustry Overview\nOur addressable market includes non-portable luminaires as defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; poles for outdoor lighting; emergency lighting fixtures and lighting equipment; daylighting; lighting controls; HVAC controls; and building technology controls, software, and systems. We expect that the industrys addressable market is likely to expand due to the benefits and value creation provided by our intelligent building platform services and location-aware and asset tracking applications.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that is affected by a number of general business and economic factors, such as, but not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, interest rates and inflation, building costs, freight, construction-related labor availability, building occupancy rates, imports and trade, energy costs, freight costs, and commodity costs (including tariffs) and availability. Our market is based on non-residential and residential construction, both new as well as renovation and retrofit activity, which may be impacted by these general economic factors. Precise segmentation of the market by new construction and renovation activity is not available, though internal estimates based on third-party data estimate the size of the markets to be about the same. Non-residential construction spending on commercial, institutional, industrial, and infrastructure projects has a material impact on the demand for our lighting and building technology solutions. Demand for our residential lighting products is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending and discretionary income, along with housing construction and home improvement spending.\nOur market is influenced by evolving technologies. This evolution includes: the development of new or improved lighting technologies, including solid-state lighting, electronic drivers, embedded lighting controls, and more effective optical designs and lamps; federal, state, and local requirements for updated energy codes; design strategies and technologies addressing sustainability and facilitating intelligent buildings; and incentives by federal, state, and local municipal authorities, as well as utility companies, for using more energy-efficient lighting and building technology solutions. We are a leading provider of integrated lighting and building technology solutions based on these technologies and utilize internally developed, licensed, or acquired intellectual property. Solid-state lighting and digital building technology systems can be converged allowing for an optimal local operating system to increase efficiency and reduce costs while also delivering productivity benefits.\nCompetition\nWe experience competition based on numerous factors, including product vitality, service capabilities, price, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, and customer relationships. The market for lighting and building technology services and solutions is competitive and continues to evolve through acquisition and consolidation activities. New entrants continue to develop capabilities and solutions that are both complementary as well as competitive to those of traditional industry participants. Additionally, the market for artificial intelligence and software solutions is active with a wide range of competitors, from existing large companies to startup organizations. Certain global and more diversified manufacturers may provide a broader product offering utilizing electrical, lighting, and building technology products and services as well as pricing benefits from the bundling of various offerings. In addition, there are competitors, including Asian importers, small startup companies, and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies.\nRegulations\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose increasingly complex, stringent and costly compliance activities. These regulations include but are not limited to, the Clean Water Act; the Safe Harbor data privacy program between the U.S. and European Union; the United States-Mexico-Canada-Free Trade Agreement (USMCA); regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration agency (OSHA); the European Unions General Data Protection Regulation; Californias Consumer Privacy Act and Connected Device Privacy Act; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the FCPA); and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nOn an ongoing basis, we allocate resources, including investments in capital and operating costs, to comply with laws and regulations. We do not currently believe that the costs of complying with government regulations have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we may be affected by current or future standards, laws, or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, substances in or components in or used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change, product functionality, geopolitical, corporate social responsibility, employee health and safety, privacy, or similar concerns. These standards, laws, or regulations may impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and services. They may also place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the\nproducts and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or may impact the willingness of certain investors to own our shares. See Part I. Item 1a.Risk Factors.\nThis filing contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. A variety of risks and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. These risks could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and financial expectations and could cause the market price of our securities to decrease. Such risks include the following, without limitation.\nRisks Related to Our Strategy\nOur business and results have been and may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the cost or availability of raw materials, components, purchased finished goods, or services.\nWe utilize a variety of raw materials and components in our production process including steel, aluminum, lamps, certain rare earth materials, microchips, light emitting diodes (LED), LED drivers, ballasts, wire, electronic components, power supplies, petroleum-based byproducts, natural gas, and copper. We also source certain finished goods externally. During fiscal 2022, the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have continued to disrupt our supply chain for certain components, including, notably, microchips and electronic, and have resulted in higher prices for significant commodities, including oil and steel, as well as increased warehousing and container costs, which have continued to negatively impact our business. These disruptions in the supply chain and shortages could affect our ability to procure components for our products on a timely basis, or at all, or could require us to commit to increased purchases and provide longer lead times to secure critical components by entering into longer term guaranteed supply agreements. Alternatively, supply chain disruptions and shortages could require us to rely on relatively high-cost spot market purchases for certain materials or products.\nFuture increases in our costs and/or continued disruptions in the supply chain could negatively impact our profitability, as there can be no assurance that future price increases will be successfully passed through to customers. We generally source these goods from a number of suppliers. However, there are a limited number of suppliers for certain components and certain purchased finished goods, which on a limited basis, results in sole-source supplier situations.\nOur competitors supply certain of those items, and those competitors may, for various strategic reasons, choose to cease selling to us. In addition, our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers, and in turn, increased risk associated with reliance on a single or a limited number of suppliers. Furthermore, volatility in certain commodities, such as oil, impacts all suppliers and, therefore, may result in additional price increases from time to time regardless of the number and availability of suppliers. Profitability and volume could be negatively impacted by limitations inherent within the supply chain of certain of these component parts, including competitive, governmental, and legal limitations, natural disasters, and other events that could impact both supply and price. Additionally, we are dependent on certain service providers for key operational functions. While there are a number of suppliers of these services, the cost to change service providers and set up new processes could be significant.\nIn addition, the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight as the U.S. economy recovers after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, and our labor costs have increased as a result.\nOur results may be adversely affected by our inability to maintain pricing.\nAggressive pricing actions by competitors may affect our ability to achieve desired revenue growth and profitability levels under our current pricing strategies. Potential decreased demand for our products resulting from factors including uncertainty in the global economy, the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, the current inflationary environment, and a potential global recession may influence competitor pricing. We may also decide to lower prices to match the competition or to adjust for current demand levels, as well as for other reasons. Additionally, dynamic pricing models may not cover our rising costs. Even if we were able to increase prices to cover our costs, competitive pricing pressures may not allow us to pass on any more than the cost increases. Alternatively, if costs were to decline, the marketplace may not allow us to hold prices at their current levels.\nOur inability to effectively innovate could adversely affect our ability to compete.\nContinual introductions of new products and solutions, services, and technologies, enhancement of existing products and services, and effective servicing of customers are key to our competitive strategy. The success of new product and solution introductions depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, timely and successful product development, product quality, market acceptance, our ability to manage the risks associated with product life cycles, such as additional inventory obsolescence risk as product life cycles begin to shorten, new products and production capabilities, effective management of purchase commitments and inventory levels to support anticipated product manufacturing and demand, availability of products in appropriate quantities and costs to meet anticipated demand, and risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, we cannot fully predict the ultimate effect of new product introductions on our business. Additionally, new products and solutions may not achieve the same profit margins as expected or as compared to our historic products and solutions. Furthermore, other market participants, such as well-established competitors, could develop alternative platforms for monetizing products, solutions, and services that result in a paradigm shift in our industry, particularly with respect to new and developing technologies.\nWe may not be able to identify, finance, and complete suitable acquisitions, alliances, or investments, and we may pursue future growth through acquisitions, alliances, or investments, which may not yield anticipated benefits.\nWe have strengthened our business through acquisitions, alliances, and investments and may continue to do so as opportunities arise in the future. Such investments have been and may be in startup or development-stage entities. We will benefit from such activity only to the extent that we can effectively identify suitable acquisition and alliance candidates and leverage and integrate the assets or capabilities of the acquired businesses and alliances, including, but not limited to, personnel, technology, and operating processes. It may be difficult for us to integrate acquired businesses efficiently into our business operations. Any acquisitions, alliances, or investments may not be successful or realize the intended benefits. Moreover, unanticipated events, negative revisions to valuation assumptions and estimates, diversion of resources and management's attention from other business concerns, and difficulties in attaining synergies, among other factors, could adversely affect our ability to recover initial and subsequent investments, particularly those related to acquired goodwill and intangible assets or non-controlling interests. In addition, such investment transactions may limit our ability to invest in other activities, which could be more profitable or advantageous.\nThe inability to effectively execute our business strategies could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nVarious uncertainties and risks are associated with the implementation of a number of aspects of our global business strategies, including but not limited to, the development, marketing, and selling of lighting, building technology, and software-based solutions; the development, marketing, and selling of new or enhanced products and solutions; effective integration of acquisitions; and our environmental strategies and climate change commitments. Those uncertainties and risks include, but are not limited to: diversion of managements attention; difficulty in retaining or attracting employees; negative impact on relationships with distributors and customers; obsolescence of current products and slow new product development; inability to effectively participate in opportunities utilizing our digital lighting and building technology systems; additional streamlining efforts; inability to produce certain components with quality, performance, and cost attributes equal to or better than provided by other component manufacturers; and unforeseen difficulties in the implementation of the management operating structure. Problems with strategy execution could offset anticipated benefits, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality as well as adversely affect our business and reputation. With the addition of new products and solutions, we may encounter new and different competitors that may have more experience with respect to such products and solutions.\nWe may experience difficulties in streamlining activities, which could impact shipments to customers, product quality, and the realization of expected savings from streamlining actions.\nWe expect to benefit from potential programs to streamline operations, including the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of overhead costs. Such benefits will only be realized to the extent that we can effectively leverage assets, personnel, and operating processes in the transition of production between manufacturing facilities. Uncertainty is inherent within the facility consolidation process, and unforeseen circumstances could offset the anticipated benefits, disrupt service to customers, and impact product quality.\nGeneral business, political, and economic conditions, including the strength of the construction market, political events, or other factors may affect demand for our products and services.\nWe compete based on numerous factors, including product vitality and service levels, as well as features and benefits, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, customer relationships, service capabilities, and price. In addition, we operate in a highly competitive environment that is influenced by a number of general business and economic factors, such as economic vitality, employment levels, credit availability, interest rates, trends in vacancy rates and rent values, energy costs, and commodity costs. Sales of lighting, lighting controls, and building technology solutions depend significantly on the level of activity in new construction and renovation/retrofits. Declines in general economic activity, appropriations, and regulations, including tax and trade policy and other political uncertainties, may negatively impact new construction and renovation projects, which in turn may impact demand for our product and service offerings.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and may continue to (along with similar events in the future) negatively impact, our ability to operate, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital investments. Several public health organizations have recommended, and some governments have implemented, certain measures to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including shelter in place, social distancing ordinances, and business shutdowns, which temporarily disrupted our ability to manufacture or distribute our products in some of these markets. A reoccurrence of these disruptions could materially adversely impact our ability to operate and results of operations. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will continue to spread, including the impact of identified and potential new variants, the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread of the virus, and public response to the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and such preventive measures have significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world and our business, and they (and similar events in the future), may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; increased claims or other expenses; potential border closures; disruptions to the businesses of our channel partners; and others. We may incur additional costs related to additional testing and screening of our employees, governmental vaccination mandates, and additional safety requirements from organizations such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Our suppliers and customers have also faced these and other challenges, which has led to a disruption in our supply chain for certain components, decreased construction and renovation spending and consumer demand for our products and services, rising commodity costs, and increased freight, warehousing, and container costs. These disruptions and challenges may continue for an indefinite period of time and may also materially affect our future access to our sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, financial condition, capitalization, and capital investments. Additionally, the continued effects of COVID-19 on the global economy, including economic slowdowns, supply chain disruptions, or recessions, could adversely affect our ability to access the capital and other financial markets, and if so, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of our customers and other counter-parties to make payments to us, on a timely basis or at all.\nAlthough these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (and similar events in the future), including but not limited to, possible impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.\nTechnological developments and increased competition could affect our operating profit margins and sales volume.\nWe compete in an industry and markets where technology and innovation play major roles in the competitive landscape. We are highly engaged in the investigation, development, and implementation of new technologies and services. Securing employee talent, key partnerships, and alliances, including having access to technologies, services, and solutions developed by others, as well as obtaining appropriate patents and the right to utilize patents of other parties all play a significant role in protecting our freedom to operate. Additionally, the continual development of new technologies by existing and new source suppliers - including non-traditional competitors with\nsignificant resources - looking for either direct market access or partnerships with competing large manufacturers, coupled with significant associated exclusivity and/or patent activity, could adversely affect our ability to sustain operating profit margins and desirable levels of sales volume.\nIn addition, there are new competitors, including small startup companies and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies. These competitors may vertically integrate and begin offering total solution packages that directly compete with our offerings. Certain global and more diversified electrical manufacturers as well as certain global technology and building solution providers may be able to obtain a competitive advantage, either through internal development or acquisitions, over us by offering broader and more integrated solutions utilizing electrical, lighting, controls, building automation systems, and data analytics, and small startup companies may offer more localized product sales and support services within individual regions.\nWe may be unable to sustain significant customer and/or channel partner relationships.\nRelationships with customers are directly impacted by our ability to deliver quality products and services. Although no individual customer exceeded 10% of sales during fiscal 2022, the loss of or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases by certain larger customers could harm our business in a meaningful manner. We have relationships with channel partners such as electrical distributors, home improvement retailers, independent sales agencies, system integrators, and value-added resellers. While we maintain positive, and in many cases long-term, relationships with these channel partners, the sudden or unplanned loss of a number of these channel partners or a substantial decrease in the volume of purchases from a major channel partner or a group of channel partners could adversely affect our business.\nWe could be adversely affected by disruptions to our operations.\nThe breakdown of equipment or other events, including, but not limited to, labor disputes, strikes, workplace violence, public health epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), climate change, brown outs and other power outages, earthquakes, fires, explosions, terrorism, adverse weather conditions, water scarcity, cyber-attacks, civil disruptions, or catastrophic events such as war or natural disasters, leading to production interruptions in our or one or more of our suppliers facilities could adversely affect us. Approximately 56% of our finished products are manufactured in Mexico, a country that periodically experiences heightened civil unrest or may experience trade disputes with the U.S., both of which could cause a disruption of the supply of products to or from these facilities. Further, because many of our customers are to varying degrees dependent on planned deliveries from our facilities, those customers that have to reschedule their own production or delay opening a facility due to our missed deliveries as a result of these disruptions could pursue financial claims against us. We may incur costs to correct any of these problems in addition to facing claims from customers. Further, our reputation among actual and potential customers may be harmed and result in a loss of business. Further, these types of events may negatively impact residential, commercial, and industrial spending in impacted regions or, depending on the severity, globally. As a result, any of such events could adversely impact us. While we have developed business continuity plans, including alternative capacity, to support responses to such events or disruptions and maintain insurance policies covering, among other things, physical damage and business interruptions, these policies may not cover all losses. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, loss of customers, and substantial losses in operational capacity.\nCompany operating systems, information systems, or devices have experienced, and may experience in the future, a failure, a compromise of security, or a violation of data privacy laws or regulations, which could adversely impact our operations as well as the effectiveness of internal controls over operations and financial reporting.\nWe are highly dependent on various software and automated systems to record and process operational and financial transactions. We have experienced, and could experience in the future, a failure of one or more of these software and automated systems or could fail to complete all necessary data reconciliation or other conversion controls when implementing a new software system.\nWe have also experienced compromises of our security, and could experience in the future, a compromise of our security due to many reasons, including technical system flaws, clerical, data input or record-keeping errors, or tampering or manipulation of our systems by employees or unauthorized third parties, including viruses, malware, or phishing. Information security risks also exist with respect to the use of portable electronic devices, such as laptops and smartphones, which are particularly vulnerable to loss and theft. We may also be subject to disruptions of any of these systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control (for example, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, including but not limited to hacking, malware, ransomware attacks, denial-of-service\nattacks, social engineering, exploitation of internet-connected devises, and other attacks, epidemics, computer viruses, and electrical/telecommunications outages). While prior compromises of our security have not had, in the aggregate, a material impact on the Companys operations and financial condition, the Company expects events of this nature to continue as cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and frequent, and the techniques used in such attacks change rapidly. The Company monitors its data, information technology and personnel usage of Company systems to reduce these risks and continues to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats.\nIf any of our hardware, software, or automated systems are compromised, fail, or have other significant shortcomings, it could disrupt our business, require us to incur substantial additional expenses, or result in potential liability or reputational damage. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology will prevent such compromises of security.\nWe also provide and maintain technology to enable lighting controls and building technology systems. In addition to the risks noted above, there are other risks associated with these customer offerings. For example, a customer may depend on integral information from, or functionality of, our technology to support that customers other systems, such that a failure of our technology could impact those systems, including by loss or destruction of data. Likewise, a customers failure to properly configure, update, segregate, or upgrade its own network and integrations with our technology are outside of our control and could result in a failure in functionality or security of our technology.\nWe and certain of our third-party vendors may receive and store personal information in connection with human resources operations, customer offerings, and other aspects of the business. A material network breach in the security of these systems could include the theft of intellectual property, trade secrets, the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, change, or destruction of our or our clients' confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal identifying information of individuals), or otherwise disrupt our or our clients' or other third parties' business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer or employee information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect relationships with our customers, employees, and other counterparties, lead to claims against us, which may result in the payment of fines, penalties, and costs, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also subject to an increasing number of data privacy and security laws and regulations that impose requirements on us and our technology prior to certain use or transfer, storing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of data and prior to sale or use of certain technologies. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines, penalties and other costs. The legal and regulatory data privacy framework is evolving and uncertain. For example, the European Court of Justices decision in October 2015 to invalidate the Safe Harbor data privacy program between the United States and the implementation of Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland, Schrems (aka Schrems II) as well as the new and proposed privacy and security laws around the world all could disrupt our ability to use or transfer data or sell products and solutions because such activities may not be in compliance with applicable law in certain jurisdictions.\nSystem failures, ineffective system implementation or disruptions, failure to comply with data privacy and security laws or regulations, or the compromise of security with respect to internal or external systems or portable electronic devices could damage our systems or infrastructure, subject us to liability claims, or regulatory fines, penalties, or intervention, harm our reputation, interrupt our operations, disrupt customer operations, and adversely affect our internal control over financial reporting, business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nChanges in our relationship with employees, changes in U.S. or international employment regulations, an inability to attract and retain talented employees, or a loss of key employees could adversely impact the effectiveness of our operations.\nWe employed approximately 13,200 people as of August 31, 2022, approximately 9,300 of whom are employed in international locations. As such, we have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing relationships with employees, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements, and payroll taxes, which likely would have a direct impact on our operating costs. Union recognition and collective bargaining agreements are in place or in process covering approximately 66% of our workforce. Collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 54% of our workforce will expire within one year, primarily due to annual negotiations with unions in Mexico. While we believe that we have good relationships with both our unionized and non-unionized employees, we may become vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage, or other labor action by these employees.\nOur success is also dependent upon our ability to attract, retain, and motivate a qualified and diverse workforce, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so, particularly during times of increased labor costs or labor shortages. We rely upon the knowledge and experience of employees involved in functions throughout the organization that require technical expertise and knowledge of the industry. We have experienced intense competition for qualified and capable personnel in key markets and with key skills, and we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or that we will be successful in attracting, assimilating, and retaining personnel in the future. In addition, our growth may be constrained by resource limitations as competitors and customers compete for increasingly scarce human capital resources. The demand for skilled workers is currently high. We face an increasingly competitive labor market due to sustained labor shortages in part from the COVID-19 pandemic and are subject to inflationary pressures on employee wages and salaries, which may increase labor costs. Our competitors may be able to offer a work environment with higher compensation or more opportunities than we can. An inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of employees could adversely impact our ability to execute key operational functions.\nThere are inherent risks in our solutions and services businesses.\nRisks inherent in the sale of solutions and services include assuming greater responsibility for successfully delivering projects that meet a particular customer specification, including: defining and controlling contract scope and timing, efficiently executing projects, and managing the performance and quality of subcontractors and suppliers. As we expand our service offerings, reliance on the technical infrastructure to provide services to customers will increase. If we fail to appropriately manage and secure the technical infrastructure required, customers could experience service outages or delays in implementation of services. If we are unable to manage and mitigate these risks, we could incur liabilities and other losses.\nWe may be subject to risk in connection with third-party relationships necessary to operate our business.\nWe utilize strategic partners and third-party relationships in order to operate and grow our business. For instance, we utilize third parties to contract manufacturing of certain products, subcontract installation and commissioning, as well as perform certain selling, distribution, and administrative functions. We cannot control the actions or performance, including product quality, of these third parties and therefore, cannot be certain that we or our end-users will be satisfied. Any future actions of or any failure to act by any third party on which our business relies could cause us to incur losses or interruptions in our operations. In addition, we act as a general contractor in certain relationships with third-parties, and as such are subject to risks applicable to general contractors.\nWe are subject to risks related to operations and suppliers outside the United States.\nWe have substantial activities outside of the United States, including sourcing of products, materials, components, and contract manufactured finished goods, as well as manufacturing and distribution activities. Our operations, as well as those of key vendors, are therefore subject to regulatory, economic, political, military, and other events in countries where these operations are located. In addition to the risks that are common to both our domestic and international operations, we face risks specifically related to our foreign operations and sourcing activities, including but not limited to: foreign currency fluctuations; unstable political, social, regulatory, economic, financial, and market conditions; laws that prohibit shipments to certain countries or restricted parties and that prohibit improper payments to government officials such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act; potential for privatization and other confiscatory actions; trade restrictions and disruption; shipping delays or disruptions; criminal activities; increases in tariffs and taxes; corruption; terrorist action; nationalization and expropriation; limitations on repatriation of earnings or other capital requirements; and other changes in regulation in international jurisdictions that could result in substantial additional legal or compliance obligations for us.\nWe source certain components and approximately 16% of our finished goods from Asia, a significant portion of which are subject to import tariffs. These tariffs could increase in future periods resulting in higher costs and/or lower demand. We are seeking to mitigate the impact of Chinese tariffs on our profitability, including a variety of activities such as engaging alternative suppliers that produce products and components whose origin is in countries other than China, insourcing the production of certain products, and raising selling prices. We could be adversely affected to the extent we are unable to mitigate the impacts of the tariffs.\nWe operate seven manufacturing facilities in Mexico, some of which are authorized to operate as Maquiladoras by the Ministry of Economy of Mexico. Maquiladora status allows us to import raw materials into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated time frame. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the Maquiladora program and other local regulations, which have become stricter in recent years. In addition, if our Mexican facilities cease to qualify for Maquiladora status or if the Mexican government adopts\nadditional adverse changes to the program, including nationalization, our manufacturing costs in Mexico would increase.\nWe are also subject to certain other laws and regulations affecting our international operations, including laws and regulations such as the United States, Mexico, Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) which, among other things, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. A majority of our sales are subject to USMCA. In addition, the US government has initiated or is considering imposing tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum. Related to this action, certain foreign governments, including China, have instituted or are considering imposing tariffs on certain U.S. goods. We source certain components and approximately 16% of our finished goods from Asia, a significant portion of which are subject to Chinese tariffs. It remains unclear what the U.S. Administration or foreign governments will or will not do with respect to tariffs, the USMCA, or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war or other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, costs, customers, suppliers, and/or the US economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our business.\nThe evolution of our products, complexity of our supply chain, and reliance on third-party vendors such as customs brokers and freight vendors, which may not have effective processes and controls to enable us to fully and accurately comply with such requirements, could subject us to liabilities for past, present, or future periods. Such liabilities could adversely impact our business.\nWe continue to monitor conditions affecting our international locations, including potential changes in income from a strengthening or weakening in foreign exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Some of these risks, including but not limited to foreign exchange rates, violations of laws, and higher costs associated with changes in regulation, could adversely impact our business.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by social impact and sustainability matters.\nThere is an increasing focus from U.S. and foreign government agencies, certain investors, customers, consumers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. Some investors may use ESG criteria to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our policies relating to corporate responsibilities are inadequate. In addition, if our competitors corporate responsibility performance is perceived to be greater than ours, potential or current investors may elect to invest in our competitors instead.\nWe may communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG matters, in our EarthLIGHT (ESG) Report, on our website, in our SEC filings, and elsewhere. These initiatives and goals could be difficult and expensive to implement, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of the disclosure of our ESG initiatives. Further, statements about our ESG initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes, and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail, or are perceived to fail, to achieve progress with respect to our ESG goals on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nFailure to comply with the broad range of standards, laws, and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate may result in exposure to substantial disruptions, costs, and liabilities.\nThe laws and regulations impacting us impose increasingly complex, stringent, and costly compliance activities, including but not limited to environmental, health, and safety protection standards and permitting, labeling, and other requirements regarding, among other things, electronic and wireless communications, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the use, handling, and disposal of hazardous or toxic materials, remediation of environmental contamination, and working conditions for and compensation of our employees. In addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain of our operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. Some environmental laws, such as Superfund, the Clean Water Act, and comparable laws in U.S. states and other jurisdictions worldwide, impose joint and several liability for the cost of environmental remediation, natural resource damages, third-party claims, and other expenses, without regard to the fault or the legality of the original conduct, on those persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations have generally\nbecome stricter in recent years, and federal, state, and local governments domestically and internationally are considering new laws and regulations, including those governing raw material composition, carbon dioxide and other air emissions, end-of-life product dispositions, and energy efficiency. We may be affected by those or other future standards, laws, or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, climate change, our carbon footprint, product functionality, geopolitical, corporate social responsibility, or similar concerns. These standards, laws, or regulations may impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and may place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or on the willingness of certain investors to own our shares.\nWe may develop unexpected legal contingencies or matters that exceed insurance coverage.\nWe are subject to and in the future may be subject to various claims, including legal claims arising in the normal course of business. Such claims may include without limitation employment claims, product recall, personal injury, network security, data privacy, or property damage claims resulting from the use of our products, services, or solutions, as well as exposure to hazardous materials, contract disputes, or intellectual property disputes. We are insured up to specified limits for certain types of losses with a self-insurance retention per occurrence, including product or professional liability, and cyber liability, including network security and data privacy claims, and are fully self-insured for certain other types of losses, including environmental, product recall, warranties, commercial disputes, and patent infringement. We establish accruals for legal claims when the costs associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the level of insurance coverage we hold and/or the amounts accrued for such claims. In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolutions of such matters could be unfavorable. Our insurance coverage is negotiated on an annual basis, and insurance policies in the future may have coverage exclusions that could cause claim-related costs to rise.\nIf our products are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, or are otherwise alleged to cause harm or injury, we may need to recall those items, may have increased warranty costs, and could be the target of product liability claims.\nWe may need to recall products if they are improperly designed, manufactured, packaged, or labeled, and we do not maintain insurance for such recall events. Many of our products and solutions have become more complex in recent years and include more sophisticated and sensitive electronic components. A problem or issue relating to any individual component could have the effect of creating a compounded problem for an integrated solution, which could result in significant costs and losses. We have increasingly manufactured certain of those components and products in our own facilities. We have previously initiated product recalls as a result of potentially faulty components, assembly, installation, design, and packaging of our products. Widespread product recalls could result in significant losses due to the costs of a recall, the destruction of product inventory, penalties, and lost sales due to the unavailability of a product for a period of time. In addition, products we developed that incorporate technologies, such as LED, generally provide for more extensive warranty protection, which may result in higher costs if warranty claims on these products are higher than historical amounts. We may also be liable if the use or failure of any of our products cause harm, whether from fire, shock, harmful materials or components, alleged adverse health impacts from exposure to light emitted by our products, or any other personal injury or property damage, and we could suffer losses from a significant product liability judgment against us in excess of our insurance limits. We may not be able to obtain indemnity or reimbursement from our suppliers or other third parties for the warranty costs or liabilities associated with our products. A significant product recall, warranty claim, or product liability case could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation, and a loss of consumer confidence in our products.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and could be the target of intellectual property claims.\nWe own certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property. In addition, we continue to file patent applications, when appropriate. We cannot be certain that others have not and will not infringe on our intellectual property rights; however, we seek to establish and protect those rights, which could result in significant legal expenses and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the last several years, we and others in the industry have received an increased number of allegations of patent infringement from competitors and from non-practicing entity patent holders, often coupled with offers to license such patents for our use. Such offers typically relate to various technologies including electronics, power systems, controls, and software, as well as the use of visible light to communicate data, the use of certain wireless networking methods, and the design of specific products. We believe that we do not need or will be able to invalidate or access such patents through licensing, cross-licensing, or other mutually beneficial arrangements,\nalthough to the extent we are required but unable to enter into such arrangements on acceptable economic terms, it could adversely impact us.\nWe are exposed to certain regulatory, financial and other risks related to climate change and other sustainability matters.\nThe scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities, and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances.\nConcerns regarding climate change may lead to significant legislative and regulatory responses, including efforts to limit GHG emissions. The EPA has implemented regulations that require reporting of GHG emissions or that limit emissions of GHGs from certain mobile or stationary sources. In addition, the U.S. Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies have considered other legislation and regulatory proposals to reduce emissions of GHGs, and many states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the development of GHG inventories, GHG permitting, and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. It is uncertain whether, when, and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions reduction program, or other state programs, may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol, and in February 2021, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Accord, and these and other existing or potential international initiatives and regulations could affect our international operations. As customers become increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of their purchases, if we fail to keep up with changing regulations or innovate or operate in ways that minimize the energy use of our products or operations, customers may choose more energy efficient or sustainable alternatives. These actions could also increase costs associated with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. We may also be subject to consumer lawsuits or enforcement actions by governmental authorities if our ESG claims relating to product marketing are inaccurate. It is uncertain what laws will be enacted, and therefore we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn addition, investors and stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters, and as stakeholder ESG expectations and standards are evolving, our failure to sufficiently respond to these evolving standards and expectations may cause us to suffer from reputational damage, and our business or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters\nThe market price and trading volume of our shares may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common shares could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including reasons unrelated to our specific performance, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions, or negative announcements by customers, competitors, or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as general global economic, industry, and political conditions. Our performance could be different than analyst expectations, causing a decline in our stock price. To the extent that other large companies within our industry experience declines in share price, our share price may decline as well. In addition, we may discontinue or reduce dividend payments and may discontinue or suspend our share repurchase program based on several factors, including our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, results of operations, financial condition and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Any modification or suspension of dividends and any suspension or termination of our share repurchase program could cause our stock price to decline.\nWhen the market price of a companys shares drops significantly, shareholders could institute securities class action lawsuits against us or otherwise engage in activism, which could cause us to incur substantial costs and could divert the time and attention of our management and other resources.\nRisks related to our defined benefit retirement plans may adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant changes in actual investment returns on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our comprehensive income and the amount of contributions we are required to make to the defined benefit plans in future periods. As our defined benefit plan assets and liabilities are marked-to-market on an annual basis, large non-cash gains or losses could be recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. In accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, the income or expense for the plans is calculated using actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest\nrates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for the defined benefit plans are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to defined benefit funding obligations. Unfavorable changes in these factors could adversely affect our results. Item 1b.Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2.Properties.\nOur general corporate offices are located in Atlanta, Georgia. Because of the diverse nature of operations and the large number of individual locations, it is neither practical nor meaningful to describe each of our operating facilities owned or leased.

At October 21, 2022, there were 1,856 stockholders of record.\nThe timing, declaration, and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will depend upon many factors, including our cash balances and potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions, including acquisitions, results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nThe information required by this item with respect to equity compensation plans is included under the caption Equity Compensation Plans in our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held January 25, 2023, which we will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A. The proxy statement is incorporated herein by reference.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOn March 31, 2022, the Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of up to five million shares of our common stock. Under the current share repurchase authorization, we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices, depending on market conditions, through open market or privately negotiated transactions. No date has been established for the completion of the share repurchase program, and we are not obligated to repurchase any shares. Subject to applicable corporate securities laws, repurchases may be made at such times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate. Repurchases under the program can be discontinued at any time management feels additional repurchases are not warranted. As of August 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board equaled 2.8 million shares. The following table summarizes share repurchase activity by month for the quarter ended August 31, 2022:\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Maximum Number of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs\n6/1/2022 through 6/30/2022 339,454 $ 166.98 339,454 3,111,550\n7/1/2022 through 7/31/2022 215,320 $ 166.92 215,320 2,896,230\n8/1/2022 through 8/31/2022 78,030 $ 179.42 78,030 2,818,200\nTotal 632,804 $ 168.50 632,804 2,818,200\nCompany Stock Performance\nThe following information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Exchange Act or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Exchange Act, and it will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any filing under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, except to the extent specifically incorporated by reference into such filing.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return to shareholders on our outstanding stock during the five years ended August 31, 2022, with the cumulative total returns of the Standard & Poors (S&P) Midcap 400 Index, the Dow Jones U.S. Electrical Components & Equipment Index, and the Dow Jones U.S. Building Materials & Fixtures Index.

(referred to herein as we, our, us, the Company, or similar references) and its subsidiaries for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within this report.\nA discussion of the year ended August 31, 2021 compared to the year ended August 31, 2020 can be found within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis within our fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2021.\nOverview\nCompany\nWe are a market-leading industrial technology company. We use technology to solve problems in spaces and light. Through our two business segments, Acuity Brands Lighting and Lighting Controls (ABL) and the Intelligent Spaces Group (ISG), we design, manufacture, and bring to market products and services that make a valuable difference in people's lives. We achieve growth through the development of innovative new products and services, including lighting, lighting controls, building management systems, and location-aware applications. We achieve customer-focused efficiencies that allow us to increase market share and deliver superior returns. We look to aggressively deploy capital to grow the business and to enter attractive new verticals.\nFinancial Condition, Capital Resources, and Liquidity\nWe have numerous sources of capital, including cash on hand and cash flows generated from operations as well as various sources of financing. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to access certain capital markets, including banks, is necessary to meet our capital allocation priorities, which are to invest in our current business for growth, to invest in mergers and acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to make share repurchases. Sufficient cash flow generation is also critical to fund our operations in the short and long terms and to maintain compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements.\nOur significant contractual cash requirements as of August 31, 2022 primarily include principal and interest on our unsecured notes and borrowings under our credit agreement as well as payments for operating lease liabilities. Further details on our borrowings and operating lease liabilities are outlined in the Debt and Lines of Credit and Leases footnotes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively, within this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, we incur purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding. Contractual purchase obligations for years subsequent to August 31, 2022 include $533.1 million in fiscal 2023. Contractual purchase obligations beyond fiscal 2023 are not significant.\nWe believe that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs over the next 12 months based on our cash on hand, current projections of cash flows from operations, and borrowing availability under financing arrangements. Additionally, we believe that our cash flows from operations and sources of funding, including, but not limited to, future borrowings and borrowing capacity, will sufficiently support our long-term liquidity needs. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional capital, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions.\nCash\nOur cash position at August 31, 2022 was $223.2 million, a decrease of $268.1 million from August 31, 2021. Cash generated from operating activities and cash on hand were used during the current year to fund our capital allocation priorities as discussed below.\nWe generated $316.3 million of cash flows from operating activities during fiscal 2022 compared with $408.7 million in the prior-year period, a decrease of $92.4 million. This decline was due primarily to higher working capital investments to support year-over-year growth as well as to mitigate inconsistent supply availability at our production facilities.\nFinancing Arrangements\nSee the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of our various financing arrangements, including the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.150% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2030 (the Unsecured Notes) as well as the terms of our $600.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility).\nAt August 31, 2022, our outstanding debt balance was $513.0 million compared to our cash position of $223.2 million. We were in compliance with all financial covenants under our financing arrangements as of August 31, 2022.\nAt August 31, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility of $577.9 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the facility less the outstanding letters of credit of $4.1 million issued under the facility. As of August 31, 2022, our cash on hand combined with the additional borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility totaled approximately $801.1 million.\nThe Unsecured Notes were issued by Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands, Inc. and ABL IP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The following tables present summarized financial information for Acuity Brands, Inc., Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc., and ABL IP Holding LLC on a combined basis after the elimination of all intercompany balances and transactions between the combined group as well as any investments in non-guarantors as of the dates and during the period presented (in millions):\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information August 31, 2022 August 31, 2021\nCurrent assets $ 1,056.6 $ 1,172.0\nCurrent assets due from non-guarantor affiliates 280.2 213.4\nNon-current assets 1,414.3 1,391.7\nCurrent liabilities 620.4 595.1\nNon-current liabilities 821.0 815.7\nSummarized Income Statement Information Year Ended August 31, 2022\nNet sales $ 3,397.2\nGross profit 1,406.4\nNet income 366.0\nCapital Allocation Priorities\nOur capital allocation priorities are to invest in our current business for growth, to invest in mergers and acquisitions, to maintain our dividend, and to make share repurchases.\nInvestments in Current Business Growth\nWe invested $56.5 million and $43.8 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, in property, plant, and equipment, primarily related to investments in new and enhanced information technology capabilities, tooling, equipment, and facility enhancements. Additionally, we invested in working capital to support growth and to mitigate inconsistent supply availability at our production facilities.\nStrategic Acquisitions and Investments\nWe seek opportunities to strategically expand and enhance our portfolio of solutions. There were no acquisitions during fiscal 2022. The $12.9 million of cash outflows in fiscal 2022 reflected in Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows primarily relate to working capital settlements for fiscal 2021 acquisitions. We invested in acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, of $75.3 million in fiscal 2021.\nPlease refer to the Acquisitions footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nDividends\nWe paid dividends on our common stock of $18.1 million ($0.52 per share) in fiscal 2022 and $19.1 million ($0.52 per share) in fiscal 2021, indicating a quarterly dividend rate of $0.13 per share. All decisions regarding the declaration and payment of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors (the Board) and are evaluated regularly in light of our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, funding requirements, applicable law, and any other factors the Board deems relevant.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $511.7 million. Total cash outflows for share repurchases during fiscal 2022 were $514.8 million. We expect to repurchase shares on an opportunistic basis subject to various factors including stock price, Company performance, market conditions, and other possible uses of cash. As of August 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board equaled 2.8 million shares.\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent worldwide government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services resulting in increased volatility in and disruptions to global markets. We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and their families and ensuring that we operate effectively. We have implemented various health and safety policies and processes at our facilities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and other locations as permitted by law.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our results of operations. The pandemic has caused reduced construction and renovation spending as well as a disruption in our supply chain for certain components, both of which negatively impacted our operating results. Although our facilities are open, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including as a result of new variants, may lead to the reimposition of previously lifted business closure requirements, the imposition of new restrictions, or the issuance of new or revised local or national health guidance. We also continue to incur additional health and safety costs including expenditures for personal protection equipment and facility enhancements to maintain proper distancing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We have taken actions to reduce costs, including the realignment of headcount with current volumes, a limit on all non-essential employee travel, other efforts to decrease discretionary spending, and reductions in our real estate footprint. Additionally, we elected to defer certain employer payroll taxes as allowable under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) signed into law on March 27, 2020. Half of these deferrals were paid in December 2021, and the remaining deferrals are due in December 2022.\nAlthough we have implemented significant measures to mitigate further spread of the virus, our employees, customers, suppliers, and contractors may continue to experience disruptions to business activities due to potential further government-mandated or voluntary shutdowns, general economic conditions, or other negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuously monitoring the adverse effects of the pandemic and identifying steps to mitigate those effects. As the COVID-19 pandemic is continually evolving, we are uncertain of its ultimate duration and impact. See Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors for further details regarding the potential impacts of COVID-19 to our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nRussia and Ukraine Conflict\nThe current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the related sanctions and other penalties imposed by countries across the globe against Russia are creating substantial uncertainty in the global economy. While we do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine and do not have significant direct exposure to customers and vendors in those countries, we are unable to predict the impact that these actions will have on the global economy or on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of the date of these financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a discussion of our results of operations in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. A discussion of our fiscal 2021 results of operations compared to fiscal 2020 can be found within Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis within our fiscal 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2021.\nThe following table sets forth information comparing the components of net income for the year ended August 31, 2022 with the year ended August 31, 2021 (in millions except per share data):\nYear Ended August 31, Increase Percent\n2022 2021 (Decrease) Change\nNet sales $ 4,006.1 $ 3,461.0 $ 545.1 15.7 %\nCost of products sold 2,333.4 1,986.0 347.4 17.5 %\nGross profit 1,672.7 1,475.0 197.7 13.4 %\nPercent of net sales 41.8 % 42.6 % (80) bps\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses 1,163.0 1,044.1 118.9 11.4 %\nSpecial charges - 3.3 (3.3) NM\nOperating profit 509.7 427.6 82.1 19.2 %\nPercent of net sales 12.7 % 12.4 % 30 bps\nOther expense:\nInterest expense, net 24.9 23.2 1.7 7.3 %\nMiscellaneous (income) expense, net (9.1) 8.2 (17.3) NM\nTotal other expense 15.8 31.4 (15.6) (49.7) %\nIncome before income taxes 493.9 396.2 97.7 24.7 %\nPercent of net sales 12.3 % 11.4 % 90 bps\nIncome tax expense 109.9 89.9 20.0 22.2 %\nEffective tax rate 22.3 % 22.7 %\nNet income $ 384.0 $ 306.3 $ 77.7 25.4 %\nDiluted earnings per share $ 11.08 $ 8.38 $ 2.70 32.2 %\nNM - not meaningful\nNet Sales\nNet sales of $4.01 billion for the year ended August 31, 2022 increased by $545.1 million, or 15.7%, compared with the prior-year period. Both our ABL and ISG segments benefited from recent price increases as well as higher volumes. Revenues from acquired companies contributed an approximately 3% increase in net sales compared to the prior year. Changes in foreign currency rates did not have a meaningful impact on net sales for the year ended August 31, 2022.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended August 31, 2022 increased $197.7 million, or 13.4%, to $1.67 billion compared with $1.48 billion for the prior year. Gross profit margin decreased 80 basis points to 41.8% for fiscal 2022 compared with 42.6% in the prior-year period. In this inflationary environment, we continued to experience material, labor, and freight escalations while also taking pricing actions that mitigated these escalations. Gross profit margin was also unfavorably impacted by the near-term dilutive effects of recent acquisitions.\nOperating Profit\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses of $1.16 billion for the year ended August 31, 2022 increased $118.9 million, or 11.4%, compared with the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher commissions and freight costs associated with higher sales as well as increased employee-related costs due, in part, to recent acquisitions.\nOperating profit for fiscal 2022 was $509.7 million compared with $427.6 million reported for the prior-year period, an increase of $82.1 million, or 19.2%. Operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 12.7% for fiscal 2022\ncompared with 12.4% for fiscal 2021. The increase in operating profit margin was primarily the result of improved leveraging of our operating costs as well as lower special charges, partially offset by a lower gross profit margin.\nOther Expense\nOther expense consists of net interest expense and net miscellaneous (income) expense, which includes non-service related components of net periodic pension cost, gains and losses associated with foreign currency-related transactions, and non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest expense, net, was $24.9 million and $23.2 million for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe reported net miscellaneous income of $9.1 million in fiscal 2022 compared with net miscellaneous expense of $8.2 million in fiscal 2021. During fiscal 2021, we recorded impairment charges totaling $6.0 million for certain unconsolidated equity investments. Further details regarding the impairment charges are included in the Fair Value Measurements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Excluding the impairments, the year-over-year change in net miscellaneous (income) expense was largely due to changes in pension cost as well as foreign currency-related transactions.\nIncome Taxes and Net Income\nOur effective income tax rate was 22.3% and 22.7% for the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in our effective income tax rate year over year is due primarily to the impact of discrete items. Further details regarding income taxes are included in the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income for fiscal 2022 increased $77.7 million, or 25.4%, to $384.0 million from $306.3 million reported for the prior year. The increase in net income resulted primarily from an increase in operating profit compared to the prior-year period partially offset by higher income tax expense related to the increase in profit.\nDiluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022 was $11.08 compared with $8.38 for the prior-year period, an increase of $2.70, or 32.2%. This increase reflects higher net income as well as lower outstanding diluted shares.\nSegment Results\nThe following tables set forth information comparing the operating results of our segments, ABL and ISG, for the year ended August 31, 2022 with the year ended August 31, 2021 (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\nABL: 2022 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Change\nNet sales $ 3,810.1 $ 3,287.3 $ 522.8 15.9 %\nOperating profit 545.6 476.2 69.4 14.6 %\nOperating profit margin 14.3 % 14.5 % (20) bps\nISG:\nNet sales $ 216.1 $ 190.0 $ 26.1 13.7 %\nOperating profit 22.7 9.9 12.8 129.3 %\nOperating profit margin 10.5 % 5.2 % 530 bps\nABL net sales for the year ended August 31, 2022 increased 15.9% compared with the prior-year period. Sales within the independent and direct sales network channels increased due primarily to benefits from recent price increases as well as higher volumes. Additionally, sales within the corporate accounts channel increased year over year as some large accounts began previously deferred maintenance and renovations. Acquisitions contributed an approximately 3% increase in sales compared to the prior year and are reflected within the other sales channel in ABL's disaggregated revenue.\nOperating profit for ABL was $545.6 million (14.3% of ABL net sales) for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared to $476.2 million (14.5% of ABL net sales) in the prior-year period, an increase of $69.4 million. The increase in operating profit was due primarily to contributions from higher sales partially offset by increased material, labor, and freight costs as well as higher operating costs to support the increase in sales.\nISG net sales for the year ended August 31, 2022 increased 13.7% compared with the prior-year period driven primarily by strong demand for building and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning controls as well as price\nincreases. ISG operating profit was $22.7 million (10.5% of ISG net sales) for the year ended August 31, 2022 compared with $9.9 million (5.2% of ISG net sales) in the prior-year period, an increase of $12.8 million. This increase was due primarily to higher sales, partially offset by increased employee costs.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in Fiscal 2022 and Accounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted\nSee the New Accounting Pronouncements footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on recently adopted and upcoming standards.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). As discussed in the Description of Business and Basis of Presentation footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on our substantial historical experience and/or other relevant factors, such as projections of future performance, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We discuss the development of accounting estimates with our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a recurring basis. See the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of our accounting policies.\nWe believe the following accounting topics represent our critical accounting estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when we transfer control of goods and services to our customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for goods and services. In the period of revenue recognition, we estimate and record provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers, in most instances, as reductions of revenue. We also maintain one-time or on-going marketing and trade-promotion programs with certain customers that require us to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs. Generally, these items are estimated based on customer agreements, historical trends, and expected demand. For sales with multiple deliverables, significant judgment may be required to determine which performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately. We allocate the expected consideration to be collected to each distinct performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is generally estimated using a cost plus margin valuation when no observable input is available.\nActual results could differ from estimates, which would require adjustments to recorded amounts. Please refer to the Revenue Recognition footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding estimates related to revenue recognition.\nInventories\nInventories include materials, direct labor, inbound freight, customs, duties, tariffs, and related manufacturing overhead. Inventories are stated on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A significant change in customer demand, market conditions, or technology could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period the change occurs.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names acquired through multiple acquisitions that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Significant estimates and assumptions were used to both identify and determine the initial fair value of these acquired intangible assets, often with the assistance of third-party valuation specialists. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimated future net sales and profitability, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Goodwill is calculated as the residual value of an acquisition's purchase price less the value of the identifiable net assets and is thus dependent on the appropriate identification and valuation of the net assets obtained in an acquisition.\nWe review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis in the fiscal fourth quarter and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the goodwill or an indefinite-lived asset is below its carrying value. An impairment loss for goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value, which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or another appropriate fair value method. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates in accordance with U.S. GAAP including, but not limited to, economic, industry, and Company-specific qualitative factors, projected future net sales, operating results, and cash flows.\nAlthough we currently believe that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are reasonable, differences between actual and expected net sales, operating results, and cash flows and/or changes in the discount rates or theoretical royalty rates used could cause these assets to be deemed impaired. If this occurs, we are required to record a non-cash charge to earnings for the write-down in the value of such assets. Such charges could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position but not our cash flows from operations.\nGoodwill\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment analysis on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter (June 1). Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level using a combination of discounted future cash flows and relevant market multiples. Our discounted cash flow analyses required significant assumptions about discount rates, short and long-term growth rates, and future profitability. We utilized estimated discount rates ranging from 9% to 13% as of June 1, 2022, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers a risk-free interest rate, beta, market risk premium, and size premium to determine an appropriate discount rate for a reporting unit. Short-term growth rates were based on managements forecasted financial results, which consider key business drivers such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes, growth in our addressable market, and general economic factors such as macroeconomic conditions, credit availability, and interest rates. We calculated the discounted cash flows attributable to our reporting units for a 10-year discrete period with a terminal value and compared this calculation to the discounted cash flows generated over a 40-year period to corroborate the reasonableness of assumptions used. The long-term growth rate used in determining terminal value was estimated at 3.5% and was primarily based on our understanding of projections for expected long-term growth in our addressable market and historical long-term performance.\nWe corroborate the values determined from our discounted cash flow models using a relevant market multiple, generally published earnings and/or revenue multiples. We also reconcile the sum of the fair values for each reporting unit to our market capitalization at the testing date, including consideration of a control premium.\nAny reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in these analyses, including revenue growth rates, discount rates, long-term growth rates, or relevant multiples would not cause the carrying value of any reporting unit to exceed its estimated fair value as determined under the goodwill impairment analysis. See the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe perform our annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses on the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter (June 1). Our indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of 13 trade names with an aggregate carrying value of $173.7 million at August 31, 2022. We utilized significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows (fair value model) in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820). Future cash flows associated with each of our indefinite-lived trade names are calculated by multiplying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name by estimated future net sales attributable to the\nrelevant trade name. The present value of the resulting after-tax cash flows is our current estimate of the fair value of each trade name. This fair value model requires us to make several significant assumptions, including specific estimated future net sales (including short and long-term growth rates), the royalty rate, and the discount rate for each trade name.\nFuture net sales and short-term growth rates are estimated for each particular trade name based on managements financial forecasts, which consider key business drivers, such as specific revenue growth initiatives, market share changes, expected growth in our addressable market, and general economic factors, such as macroeconomic conditions, credit availability, and interest rates. The long-term growth rate used in determining terminal value was estimated at 3.5% and was based primarily on our understanding of projections for expected long-term growth for our addressable market and historical long-term performance. The theoretical royalty rate is estimated primarily using managements assumptions regarding the amount a willing third party would pay to use the particular trade name and is compared with market information for similar intellectual property within and outside of the industry. If future operating results are unfavorable compared with forecasted amounts, we may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model, which would result in lower expected future after-tax cash flows in the fair value model. We utilized a range of estimated discount rates between 9% and 13% as of June 1, 2022, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers a current risk-free interest rate, beta, market risk premium, and size premium appropriate for each intangible.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we performed an evaluation of the fair values of our indefinite-lived trade names. Our expected revenues were based on our fiscal 2023 projections and recent third-party lighting, controls, and building technology solutions market growth estimates for fiscal 2024 through 2025 as of June 1, 2022. We also included revenue growth estimates based on current initiatives expected to help improve performance. During fiscal 2022, estimated theoretical royalty rates ranged between 1% and 3%. The impairment analyses of our indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that their fair values exceeded their carrying values; therefore, no impairments were recorded for fiscal 2022. Any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses for our trade names, including revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and discount rates, would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. See the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.\nShare-based Payment Expense\nWe recognize compensation cost for share-based payment transactions in the financial statements under the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718). Restricted stock awards, performance stock awards, and director stock units representing certain deferrals into the Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the Director Plan) are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We review the values of our performance awards on a frequent and recurring basis and adjust those values based on the probability that the related performance metric will be satisfied. We utilize the Black-Scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of our stock option awards that only have a service requirement, and we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine grant date fair value estimates of stock options also subject to a market condition.\nAdditionally, we estimate forfeitures of all share-based awards at the time of grant, which are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from initial estimates. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience. If factors change causing different assumptions to be made in future periods, estimated compensation expense may differ significantly from that recorded in the current period.\nWe generally recognize compensation cost for share-based payment transactions on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period as defined by ASC 718. In certain circumstances, such as when a performance award is subject to graded vesting, we apply the accelerated attribution method to recognize compensation cost related to our share-based payment awards.\nSee the Share-based Payments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these awards, including assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our awards.\nProduct Warranty and Recall Costs\nOur products generally have a standard warranty term of five years. We accrue for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized. Estimated future warranty costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty claims. Estimated costs related to product warranty and recall costs outside of our historical experience, which could include significant product recalls or formal campaigns soliciting repair or return of a product, are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nAny estimated or actual loss recoveries that offset our costs and payments are reflected as assets based on the timing of receipt of recovery.\nWe are fully self-insured for product warranty costs. Although we expect that historical activity will continue to be the best indicator of future warranty costs, there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts. If actual future warranty or recall costs exceed recorded amounts, additional accruals may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe also sell certain service-type warranties that extend coverages for products beyond their base warranties. We account for service-type warranties as distinct performance obligations, allocate an appropriate amount of transaction price to these transactions, and recognize revenue for these contracts ratably over the life of the additional warranty period. We allocate transaction price to our service-type warranties largely based on expectations of cost plus margin based on our estimate of future claims. These estimates are subject to a higher level of estimation uncertainty than other estimates, as we have less experience in costs in the extended warranty period. Claims related to service-type warranties are expensed as incurred.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Information\nThis filing contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements made herein that may be considered forward-looking include statements incorporating terms such as expects, believes, intends, anticipates, and similar terms that relate to future events, performance, or results of the Company. In addition, the Company, or the executive officers on the Companys behalf, may from time to time make forward-looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or in connection with oral statements made to the press, current and potential investors, or others. Forward-looking statements include, without limitation: (a) our projections regarding financial performance, including our expected margins and ability to leverage operating costs, liquidity, capital structure, capital expenditures, investments, share repurchases, and dividends; (b) external and internal forecasts projecting growth in our addressable market; (c) expectations about the impact of any changes in demand, including improvements in our end markets, as well as volatility, challenges, and uncertainty in general economic conditions; (d) expectations about volatility in raw material, purchased finished goods, and transportation costs as well as component and labor availability; (e) our ability to execute and realize benefits from initiatives related to streamlining our operations and integrating recent acquisitions, realize synergies from acquisitions, capitalize on growth opportunities, introduce innovative products and services, and realize benefits from sustainability initiatives; (f) our estimate of our future results of operations and cash flows; (g) our estimate of future amortization expense; (h) the impact of future product warranty and recall costs; (i) our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and measures; (j) the impact of changes in the political landscape and related policy changes, including monetary, regulatory, tax, and trade policies; (k) our expectations about the resolution of legal matters; (l) our expectations of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine; (m) our human capital initiatives; and (n) our ability to reduce our carbon output and seize market opportunities related to sustainability. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this annual report. Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to publicly update or release any revisions to these forward-looking statements to reflect any events or circumstances after the date of this annual report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. Our forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the historical experience of the organization and managements present expectations or projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, customer and supplier relationships and prices; competition; ability to realize anticipated benefits from initiatives taken and timing of benefits; market demand; litigation and other contingent liabilities; and economic, political, governmental, and technological factors that have affected us as a company. Also, additional risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements are discussed in Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are specifically incorporated herein by reference.\nThe industry and market data contained in this report are based either on managements own estimates or, where indicated, independent industry publications, reports by governmental agencies, or market research firms or other published independent sources and, in each case, are believed by our management to be reasonable estimates. However, industry and market data are subject to change and cannot always be verified with complete certainty due to limits on the availability and reliability of raw data, the voluntary nature of the data gathering process, and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any statistical survey of market shares. We have not independently verified market and industry data from third-party sources. Item 7a.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nGeneral\nWe are exposed to worldwide market risks that may impact our Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity due primarily to changing interest and foreign exchange rates. We do not currently engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials. The following discussion provides additional information regarding our market risks.\nInterest Rates\nInterest rate fluctuations expose variable-rate debt of the organization to changes in interest expense and cash flows. As of August 31, 2022, our long-term debt consisted primarily of fixed-rate senior unsecured notes. A fluctuation in interest rates would not affect interest expense or cash flows related to the Companys fixed-rate debt. However, a 10% increase in market interest rates at August 31, 2022 would have decreased the estimated fair value of our senior unsecured notes by approximately $14.9 million. Additionally, as of August 31, 2022, we had $18.0 million of borrowings outstanding on our credit facility. Interest incurred on these borrowings is not significant to our overall results of operations. See the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Form 10-K for additional information.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nThe majority of our net sales, expense, and capital purchases are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, exposure with respect to foreign exchange rate fluctuation exists due to our operations in Mexico and Canada, where a significant portion of products sold are produced or sourced from the United States, and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Based on fiscal 2022 performance, a hypothetical decline in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar of 10% would negatively impact operating profit by approximately $13 million, while a hypothetical appreciation of 10% in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar would favorably impact operating profit by approximately $16 million. In addition to products and services sold in Mexico, a significant portion of the goods sold in the United States are manufactured in Mexico. A hypothetical 10% decrease in the value of the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar would favorably impact operating profit by approximately $15 million, while a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the Mexican peso in relation to the U.S. dollar would negatively impact operating profits by approximately $18 million. The individual impacts to the operating profit of hypothetical currency fluctuations in the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso have been calculated in isolation from any potential responses to address such exchange rate changes in our foreign markets.\nOur exposure to foreign currency risk related to our operations in Europe is immaterial and has been excluded from this analysis.

Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of August 31, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nErnst & Young LLP (PCAOB ID: 42), the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on its audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. This report dated October 26, 2022 is included within this Form 10-K.\n/s/ NEIL M. ASHE /s/ KAREN J. HOLCOM\nNeil M. AsheChairman, President and\nChief Executive Officer\nKaren J. Holcom\nSenior Vice President and\nChief Financial Officer\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Acuity Brands, Inc. (the Company) as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at August 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated October 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nValuation of Indefinite-Lived Trade Names\nDescription of the Matter At August 31, 2022, the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets consisted of thirteen trade names with an aggregate carrying value of approximately $173.7 million. As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company tests indefinite-lived trade names for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name is below its carrying amount. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded in the amount equal to the excess.\nAuditing the Companys impairment tests for indefinite-lived trade names was especially complex due to the judgmental nature of the significant assumptions used in the determination of estimated fair values for trade names. The Company estimates the fair values of trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows. Significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the trade names included estimated future net sales (including short- and long-term growth rates), discount rates and royalty rates, all of which are forward-looking and could be affected by economic, industry and company-specific qualitative factors.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys annual impairment process. This included testing controls over managements review of the discounted cash flow model, including the significant assumptions described above.\nTo test the fair values of the Companys indefinite-lived trade names, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Companys use of the discounted cash flow model, the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data and the significant assumptions described above. We compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, the Companys historical results and other relevant factors. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the Companys discount rates and royalty rates. In addition, we considered the accuracy of the Companys historical projections of net sales compared to actual net sales. We also performed a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the potential change in the fair values of the trade names resulting from changes in the significant assumptions.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2002.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOctober 26, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of Acuity Brands, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Acuity Brands, Inc.s internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Acuity Brands, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, cash flows and stockholders equity for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated October 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOctober 26, 2022\nACUITY BRANDS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions, except share data)\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 223.2 $ 491.3\nAccounts receivable, less reserve for doubtful accounts of $1.2 and $1.2, respectively\n665.9 571.8\nInventories 485.7 398.7\nPrepayments and other current assets 91.2 82.5\nTotal current assets 1,466.0 1,544.3\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 276.5 269.1\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 74.9 58.0\nGoodwill 1,084.3 1,094.7\nIntangible assets, net 529.2 573.2\nDeferred income taxes 1.3 1.9\nOther long-term assets 48.0 33.9\nTotal assets $ 3,480.2 $ 3,575.1\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 397.8 $ 391.5\nCurrent maturities of debt 18.0 -\nCurrent operating lease liabilities 15.7 15.9\nAccrued compensation 88.0 95.3\nOther accrued liabilities 214.1 189.5\nTotal current liabilities 733.6 692.2\nLong-term debt 495.0 494.3\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 67.4 46.7\nAccrued pension liabilities 41.4 60.2\nDeferred income taxes 102.1 101.0\nOther long-term liabilities 128.9 136.2\nTotal liabilities 1,568.4 1,530.6\nCommitments and contingencies (see Commitments and Contingencies footnote)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value; 50,000,000 shares authorized; none issued\n- -\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value; 500,000,000 shares authorized; 54,241,069 and 54,018,978 issued, respectively\n0.5 0.5\nPaid-in capital 1,036.3 995.6\nRetained earnings 3,176.2 2,810.3\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (125.8) (98.2)\nTreasury stock, at cost - 21,753,820 and 18,826,611 shares, respectively\n(2,175.4) (1,663.7)\nTotal stockholders equity 1,911.8 2,044.5\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity $ 3,480.2 $ 3,575.1\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(In millions, except per-share data)\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet sales $ 4,006.1 $ 3,461.0 $ 3,326.3\nCost of products sold 2,333.4 1,986.0 1,923.9\nGross profit 1,672.7 1,475.0 1,402.4\nSelling, distribution, and administrative expenses 1,163.0 1,044.1 1,028.5\nSpecial charges - 3.3 20.0\nOperating profit 509.7 427.6 353.9\nOther expense:\nInterest expense, net 24.9 23.2 23.3\nMiscellaneous (income) expense, net (9.1) 8.2 5.9\nTotal other expense 15.8 31.4 29.2\nIncome before income taxes 493.9 396.2 324.7\nIncome tax expense 109.9 89.9 76.4\nNet income $ 384.0 $ 306.3 $ 248.3\nEarnings per share(1):\nBasic earnings per share $ 11.23 $ 8.44 $ 6.29\nBasic weighted average number of shares outstanding 34.182 36.284 39.453\nDiluted earnings per share $ 11.08 $ 8.38 $ 6.27\nDiluted weighted average number of shares outstanding 34.645 36.554 39.601\nDividends declared per share $ 0.52 $ 0.52 $ 0.52\nComprehensive income:\nNet income $ 384.0 $ 306.3 $ 248.3\nOther comprehensive income (loss) items:\nForeign currency translation adjustments (33.3) 13.3 11.9\nDefined benefit plans, net of tax 5.7 21.2 6.8\nOther comprehensive (loss) income items, net of tax (27.6) 34.5 18.7\nComprehensive income $ 356.4 $ 340.8 $ 267.0\n______________________________\n(1) Earnings per share is calculated using unrounded numbers.

We achieve growth through the development of innovative new products and services, including lighting, lighting controls, building management systems, and location-aware applications.\nABL Segment\nABL's portfolio of lighting solutions includes commercial, architectural, and specialty lighting in addition to lighting controls and components that can be combined to create integrated lighting controls systems. We offer devices such as luminaires that predominantly utilize light emitting diode (LED) technology designed to optimize energy efficiency and comfort for various indoor and outdoor applications. ABL's portfolio of products includes but is not limited to the following brands: Lithonia Lighting\u00ae, Holophane\u00ae, Peerless\u00ae, Gotham\u00ae, Mark Architectural LightingTM, Winona\u00ae Lighting, Juno\u00ae, IndyTM, AculuxTM, Healthcare Lighting\u00ae, Hydrel\u00ae, American Electric Lighting\u00ae, Sunoptics\u00ae, eldoLED\u00ae, nLight\u00ae, Sensor Switch\u00ae, IOTA\u00ae, A-LightTM, CycloneTM, Eureka\u00ae, Luminaire LEDTM, Luminis\u00ae, Dark to Light\u00ae, RELOC\u00ae Wiring Solutions, and OPTOTRONIC\u00ae.\nPrincipal customers of ABL include electrical distributors, retail home improvement centers, electric utilities, national accounts, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, digital retailers, lighting showrooms, and energy service companies located in North America and select international markets serving new construction, renovation and retrofit, and maintenance and repair applications. ABL's lighting and lighting controls solutions are sold primarily through a network of independent sales agencies that cover specific geographic areas and market channels, by internal sales representatives, through consumer retail channels, directly to large corporate accounts, and directly to OEM customers. Products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facilities or through a network of distribution centers, regional warehouses, and commercial warehouses using both common carriers and a company-managed truck fleet. To serve international customers, our sales forces utilize a variety of distribution methods to meet specific individual customer or country requirements.\nABL comprised approximately 95% of consolidated revenues during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nISG Segment\nISG delivers products and services that make spaces smarter, safer, and greener. ISG offers a building management platform and location-aware applications. Our building management platform includes products for controlling heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting, shades, and building access that deliver end-to-end optimization of those building systems. Our Atrius\u00ae intelligent building software enhances the occupant experience, improves building system management, and automates labor intensive tasks while delivering operational energy efficiency and cost reductions. Through a connected and converged building system architecture, our Atrius\u00ae software delivers different applications, allows clients to upgrade over time with natural refresh cycles, and deploys new capabilities through both software and hardware updates. Customers of ISG primarily include system integrators as well as retail stores, airports, and enterprise campuses throughout North America and select international locations. ISG products and solutions are marketed under multiple brand names, including but not limited to Distech Controls\u00ae and Atrius\u00ae.\nISG comprised approximately 5% of consolidated revenues during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe have prepared the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) to present the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of Acuity Brands, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Acuity Brands, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany transactions and accounts.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to the Revenue Recognition footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to our revenue recognition accounting policies.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash in excess of daily requirements is invested in time deposits and marketable securities and is included in the accompanying balance sheets at fair value. We consider time deposits and marketable securities with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes a reserve for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of our receivables. Our estimation of current expected credit losses reflects our considerations of historical write-offs, an analysis of past due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables, and the economic status of customers, if known. We additionally consider the impact of general economic conditions, including construction spending, unemployment rates, and macroeconomic growth, on our customers' future ability to meet their obligations. We believe that the reserve is sufficient to cover uncollectible amounts; however, there can be no assurance that unanticipated future business conditions of customers will not have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nConcentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables, which are typically unsecured, are generally limited due to the wide variety of customers and markets using our lighting, lighting controls, building management systems, and location-aware applications as well as their dispersion across many different geographic areas. One customer accounted for approximately 10% of receivables at August 31, 2022 and at August 31, 2020. No single customer accounted for 10% of receivables at August 31, 2021. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nReclassifications\nWe may reclassify certain prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. No material reclassifications occurred during the current period.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInventories\nInventories include materials, direct labor, inbound freight, customs, duties, tariffs, and related manufacturing overhead. Inventories are stated on a first-in, first-out basis at the lower of cost and net realizable value and consist of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nRaw materials, supplies, and work in process(1)\n$ 252.6 $ 209.5\nFinished goods 264.0 227.2\nInventories excluding reserves 516.6 436.7\nLess: Reserves (30.9) (38.0)\nTotal inventories $ 485.7 $ 398.7\n_______________________________________\n(1) Due to the immaterial amount of estimated work in process and the short lead times for the conversion of raw materials to finished goods, we do not believe the segregation of raw materials and work in process is meaningful information.\nWe review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions. A significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in the period the change occurs. The following table summarizes the changes in our inventory reserves for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nBeginning balance $ 38.0 $ 49.3 $ 22.3\nAdditions to reserve 15.7 21.4 36.3\nDisposals of reserved inventory (22.5) (32.7) (11.1)\nForeign currency translation adjustments (0.3) - 1.8\nEnding balance $ 30.9 $ 38.0 $ 49.3\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe classify assets as held for sale when a plan for disposal is developed and approved, the asset is available for immediate sale, an active program to locate a buyer at a price reasonable in relation to current fair value is initiated, and transfer of the asset is expected to be completed within one year. We cease the depreciation and amortization of the assets when all of these criteria have been met and generally reflect balances within Prepayments and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We did not have any assets classified as held for sale at August 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2022, we sold one building classified as held for sale at August 31, 2021 with a total carrying value of $6.6 million for a gain of approximately $2.3 million. This gain is reflected in Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill during the periods presented by segment are summarized as follows (in millions):\nABL ISG Total\nBalance as of August 31, 2020 $ 1,012.6 $ 67.4 $ 1,080.0\nAdditions from acquired businesses 6.9 3.1 10.0\nForeign currency translation adjustments 2.7 2.0 4.7\nBalance as of August 31, 2021 1,022.2 72.5 1,094.7\nAdjustments to provisional amounts from acquired businesses 2.3 - 2.3\nForeign currency translation adjustments (10.3) (2.4) (12.7)\nBalance as of August 31, 2022 $ 1,014.2 $ 70.1 $ 1,084.3\nSummarized information for our acquired intangible assets is as follows as of the dates presented (in millions except amortization periods):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nGross Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization Gross Carrying\nAmount Accumulated\nAmortization\nDefinite-lived intangible assets:\nPatents and patented technology $ 160.8 $ (116.0) $ 164.6 $ (104.4)\nTrademarks and trade names 27.2 (18.3) 27.2 (17.1)\nDistribution network 61.8 (47.3) 61.8 (45.0)\nCustomer relationships 427.7 (140.4) 429.2 (117.9)\nTotal definite-lived intangible assets $ 677.5 $ (322.0) $ 682.8 $ (284.4)\nIndefinite-lived trade names $ 173.7 $ 174.8\nThrough multiple acquisitions, we acquired definite-lived intangible assets consisting primarily of customer relationships, patented technology, distribution networks, and trademarks and trade names associated with specific products, which are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names that are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Significant estimates and assumptions were used to determine the initial fair value of these acquired intangible assets, including estimated future short-term and long-term net sales and profitability, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. Certain of our intangible assets are attributable to foreign operations and are impacted by currency translation due to movements in foreign currency rates year over year.\nWe recorded amortization expense of $41.0 million, $40.7 million, and $41.7 million related to acquired intangible assets during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense is generally recorded on a straight-line basis and is expected to be approximately $42.9 million in fiscal 2023, $38.5 million in fiscal 2024, $30.9 million in fiscal 2025, $28.3 million in fiscal 2026, and $26.4 million in fiscal 2027.\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the first date of our fourth fiscal quarter (June 1) or more frequently as facts and circumstances change, as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (ASC 350). ASC 350 allows for an optional qualitative analysis for goodwill to determine the likelihood of impairment. If the qualitative review results in a more likely than not probability of impairment, a quantitative analysis is required. The qualitative step may be bypassed entirely in favor of a quantitative test.\nThe quantitative analysis identifies impairments by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair values can be determined based on a combination of valuation techniques including the expected present value of future cash flows, a market multiple approach, and a comparable transaction approach. If\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is not considered impaired. Conversely, if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge for the difference would be recorded.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, we used a quantitative analysis to calculate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of discounted future cash flows and relevant market multiples. The analysis for goodwill did not result in an impairment charge during fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nThe impairment test for indefinite-lived trade names compares the fair value of a trade name with its carrying value. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recorded for the amount of the excess. We estimate the fair value of indefinite-lived trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows. Significant assumptions, including estimated future short-term and long-term net sales, royalty rates, and discount rates, are used in the determination of estimated fair value for indefinite-lived trade names. The impairment analyses of our indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that their fair values exceeded their carrying values for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, and thus no impairment charges were recorded during those years. Any reasonably likely change in the assumptions used in the analyses for our trade names would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nBased on the results of the indefinite-lived intangible asset analyses for fiscal 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $1.4 million for one trade name within Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income related to our ABL segment. The impairment analyses for fiscal 2020 of the other 12 indefinite-lived intangible assets indicated that their fair values exceeded their carrying values.\nOther Long-Term Assets\nOther long-term assets consist of the following items whose economic benefits are expected to be realized greater than one year from the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nDeferred contract costs $ 13.3 $ 12.9\nInvestments in debt and equity securities 11.9 5.3\nPensions plans in which plan assets exceed benefit obligation 8.0 13.0\nOther(1) (2)\n14.8 2.7\nTotal other long-term assets $ 48.0 $ 33.9\n_______________________________________\n(1)Estimated recoveries of warranty and recall costs are included in this category and account for the majority of the year-over-year change.\n(2)Included within this category are company-owned life insurance investments. We maintain life insurance policies on 60 former employees primarily to satisfy obligations under certain deferred compensation plans. These company-owned life insurance policies are presented net of loans that are secured by these policies. This program is frozen, and no new policies were issued in the three-year period ended August 31, 2022.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities consist of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nCustomer incentive programs(1)\n$ 40.7 $ 33.9\nRefunds to customers(1)\n28.0 28.1\nCurrent deferred revenues(1)\n11.4 7.7\nSales commissions 41.9 28.9\nFreight costs 22.8 17.6\nWarranty and recall costs(2)\n22.4 16.8\nTax-related items(3)\n13.9 11.7\nInterest on long-term debt(4)\n2.3 2.4\nOther 30.7 42.4\nTotal other current liabilities $ 214.1 $ 189.5\n____________________________________\n(1)Refer to the Revenue Recognition footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(2)Refer to the Commitments and Contingencies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(3)Includes accruals for income, property, sales and use, and value added taxes.\n(4)Refer to the Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOther Long-Term Liabilities\nOther long-term liabilities consist of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nDeferred compensation and postretirement benefits other than pensions(1)\n$ 44.4 $ 43.1\nDeferred revenues(2)\n53.1 56.7\nUnrecognized tax position liabilities, including interest(3)\n22.0 19.7\nSelf-insurance liabilities(4)\n3.7 3.9\nProduct warranty and recall costs(4)\n4.9 3.5\nOther 0.8 9.3\nTotal other long-term liabilities $ 128.9 $ 136.2\n____________________________________\n(1)We maintain several non-qualified retirement plans for the benefit of eligible employees, primarily deferred compensation plans. The deferred compensation plans provide for elective deferrals of an eligible employees compensation and, in some cases, matching contributions by the organization. We maintain life insurance policies on certain former officers and other key employees as a means of satisfying a portion of these obligations.\n(2)Refer to the Revenue Recognition footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(3)Refer to the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n(4)Refer to the Commitments and Contingencies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShipping and Handling Fees and Costs\nWe include shipping and handling fees billed to customers in Net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nWhen a product is sold, the associated shipping and handling costs are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on their function. Costs associated with inbound freight and freight between manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are generally recorded in Cost of products sold, which may be capitalized into inventory. Other shipping and handling costs, which primarily include amounts incurred to transfer finished goods to a customer's desired location, are included in Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses and totaled $151.2 million, $132.0 million, and $121.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nShare-based Payments\nWe recognize compensation cost for share-based payment transactions in the financial statements based on the estimated grant date fair value of the equity instrument issued. We account for stock options, restricted stock, performance stock units, and stock units representing certain deferrals into the Nonemployee Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the Director Plan) or the Supplemental Deferred Savings Plan (SDSP) (both of which are discussed further in the Share-based Payments footnote) based on the grant-date fair value estimated under the current provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718).\nShare-based payment expense includes expense related to restricted stock, performance stock units, options issued, and stock units deferred into the Director Plan. We recorded $37.4 million, $32.5 million, and $38.2 million of share-based payment expense for the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We generally recognize compensation cost for share-based payment transactions on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period as defined by ASC 718. In certain circumstances, such as when a performance award is subject to graded vesting, we apply the accelerated attribution method to recognize compensation cost related to our share-based payment awards. We have recorded share-based payment expense, net of estimated forfeitures, in Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe total income tax benefit recognized for share-based payment expense was $9.6 million, $6.5 million, and $6.6 million for the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Excess tax benefits and/or expense related to share-based payment awards are reported within Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We recognized net excess tax benefit related to share-based payment cost of $4.8 million for the year ended August 31, 2022 and net excess tax expense related to share-based payment cost of $0.5 million and $1.4 million for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSee the Share-based Payments footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is initially recorded at cost and depreciated principally on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of plant and equipment (3 to 40 years for buildings and related improvements and 2 to 15 years for machinery and equipment) for financial reporting purposes. Accelerated depreciation methods are used for income tax purposes. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvement. Depreciation expense amounted to $53.8 million, $59.4 million, and $59.4 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The balance of property, plant, and equipment consists of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nLand $ 22.0 $ 22.4\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 202.3 198.0\nMachinery and equipment 667.6 624.9\nTotal property, plant, and equipment, at cost 891.9 845.3\nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization (615.4) (576.2)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 276.5 $ 269.1\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development (R&D) expense consists of compensation, payroll taxes, employee benefits, materials, supplies, and other administrative costs, but it does not include all new or enhanced product development costs. R&D expense is expensed as incurred and is included in Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. R&D expense amounted to $95.1 million, $88.3 million, and $82.0 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included within Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. These costs totaled $19.3 million, $15.9 million, and $15.1 million during fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net, is comprised primarily of interest expense on long-term debt, line of credit borrowings, and loans that are secured by and presented net of company-owned life insurance policies on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest expense is partially offset by interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents.\nThe following table summarizes the components of Interest expense, net during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nInterest expense $ 27.0 $ 24.2 $ 26.4\nInterest income (2.1) (1.0) (3.1)\nInterest expense, net $ 24.9 $ 23.2 $ 23.3\nMiscellaneous (Income) Expense, Net\nMiscellaneous (income) expense, net, is comprised primarily of non-service related components of net periodic pension cost, gains and losses associated with foreign currency-related transactions, and non-operating gains and losses. Amounts relating to foreign currency transactions consisted of net gains of $5.3 million in fiscal 2022, net losses of $1.3 million in fiscal 2021, and net losses of $5.9 million in fiscal 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are taxed at statutory corporate rates after adjusting income reported for financial statement purposes for certain items that are treated differently for income tax purposes. Deferred income tax expenses or benefits result from changes during the year in cumulative temporary differences between the tax basis and book basis of assets and liabilities. Refer to the Income Taxes footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency for foreign operations is generally the local currency where the foreign operations are domiciled. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed for balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates and for revenue and expense accounts using a weighted average exchange rate each month during the year. The gains or losses resulting from the balance sheet translation are included in Foreign currency translation adjustments in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and are excluded from net income.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income represents a measure of all changes in equity that result from recognized transactions and other economic events other than transactions with owners in their capacity as owners. Other comprehensive income (loss) items includes foreign currency translation and pension adjustments.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss net of tax during the periods presented (in millions):\nForeign Currency Items Defined Benefit Pension Plans Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Items\nBalance as of August 31, 2020 $ (53.5) $ (79.2) $ (132.7)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications 13.3 13.9 27.2\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1)\n- 7.3 7.3\nNet current period other comprehensive income 13.3 21.2 34.5\nBalance as of August 31, 2021 (40.2) (58.0) (98.2)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications (33.3) 0.7 (32.6)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss (1)\n- 5.0 5.0\nNet current period other comprehensive (loss) income (33.3) 5.7 (27.6)\nBalance as of August 31, 2022 $ (73.5) $ (52.3) $ (125.8)\n_______________________________________\n(1)The before tax amounts of the defined benefit pension plan items are included in net periodic pension cost.

ASU 2019-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, or our fiscal 2022. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. We adopted ASU 2019-12 as of September 1, 2021 as required by the standard. This standard did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAccounting Standards Yet to Be Adopted\nASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2021-08)\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, which requires companies to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination as if the acquiring company originated the related revenue contracts. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, or our fiscal 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impacts of ASU 2021-08 to determine whether we will adopt early or in fiscal 2024. Amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis from the date of adoption. We will apply the provisions of ASU 2021-08 after adoption to future acquisitions, if any.\nAll other newly issued accounting pronouncements not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.\nNote 4 - Acquisitions\nThe following discussion relates to fiscal 2021 and 2020 acquisitions. There were no acquisitions during fiscal 2022. The $12.9 million of cash outflows reflected in the fiscal 2022 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate to fiscal 2021 acquisitions primarily for working capital settlements.\nFiscal 2021 Acquisitions\nams OSRAM's North American Digital Systems Business\nOn July 1, 2021, using cash on hand, we acquired certain assets and liabilities of ams OSRAMs North American Digital Systems business (OSRAM DS). This acquisition is intended to enhance our LED driver and controls technology portfolio and accelerate our innovation, expand our access to market through a more fulsome original equipment manufacturer (OEM) product offering, and give us more control over our supply chain.\nRockpile Ventures\nOn May 18, 2021, using cash on hand, we acquired all of the equity interests of Rockpile Ventures, an accelerator of edge artificial intelligence (AI) startups. Rockpile Ventures helps early-stage artificial intelligence companies drive co-engineering and co-selling partnerships with major cloud ecosystems, enabling faster adoption from proof-of-concept trials to market scale.\nAccounting for Fiscal 2021 Acquisitions\nWe accounted for the acquisitions of Rockpile Ventures and OSRAM DS (collectively the 2021 Acquisitions) in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805). We finalized the acquisition accounting for the 2021 Acquisitions during fiscal 2022. There were no material changes to our financial statements as a result of the finalization of the acquisition accounting for these acquisitions.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe aggregate purchase price of the 2021 Acquisitions reflects goodwill of $12.3 million and definite-lived customer-based intangible assets of $6.7 million, which have a useful life of approximately 11 years. Goodwill recognized from the 2021 Acquisitions is comprised primarily of expected synergies from obtaining more control over our supply chain and technology, combining the operations of the acquired business with our operations, and acquiring the associated trained workforce. As of August 31, 2022, goodwill from the 2021 Acquisitions totaling $9.2 million is tax deductible.\nFiscal 2020 Acquisitions\nThe Luminaires Group\nOn September 17, 2019, using cash on hand and borrowings under available existing credit arrangements at that time, we acquired all of the equity interests of The Luminaires Group (TLG), a leading provider of specification-grade luminaires for commercial, institutional, hospitality, and municipal markets, all of which complement our dynamic lighting portfolio. TLGs indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures are marketed to architects, landscape architects, interior designers, and engineers through five niche lighting brands: A-light\u2122, Cyclone\u2122, Eureka\u00ae, Luminaire LED\u2122, and Luminis\u00ae.\nLocusLabs, Inc.\nOn November 25, 2019, using cash on hand, we acquired all of the equity interests of LocusLabs, Inc (LocusLabs). The LocusLabs software platform supports navigation applications used on mobile devices, web browsers, and digital displays in airports, event centers, multi-floor office buildings, and campuses.\nAccounting for Fiscal 2020 Acquisitions\nThe TLG and LocusLabs acquisitions are referred to herein collectively as the 2020 Acquisitions. We finalized the acquisition accounting for the 2020 Acquisitions during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. There were no material changes to our financial statements as a result of the finalization of the acquisition accounting for the 2020 Acquisitions.\nThe aggregate purchase price of the 2020 Acquisitions reflects total goodwill and identified intangible assets of approximately $107.6 million and $180.6 million, respectively. Identified intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived marketing-related intangibles as well as definite-lived customer-based and technology-based assets, which have a weighted average useful life of approximately 16 years. Goodwill recognized from these acquisitions is comprised primarily of expected benefits related to complementing and expanding our solutions portfolio, including dynamic lighting and software, as well as the trained workforce acquired with these businesses and expected synergies from combining the operations of the acquired businesses with our operations. Goodwill from these acquisitions totaling $77.7 million is tax deductible.\nNote 5 - Fair Value Measurements\nWe determine fair value measurements based on the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), establishes a three-level hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on (i) unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market (Level 1), (ii) quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the asset or liability (Level 2), and (iii) prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3).\nWe utilize valuation methodologies to determine the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities in conformity with the concepts of exit price and the fair value hierarchy as prescribed in ASC 820. All valuation methods and assumptions are validated at least quarterly to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the fair values. There were no material changes to the valuation methods or assumptions used to determine fair values during the current period. No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period. In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Instruments Recorded at Fair Value\nWe use quoted market prices to determine the fair value of Level 1 assets and liabilities. Our cash and cash equivalents (Level 1), which are required to be carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis, were $223.2 million and $491.3 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe hold a small number of strategic investments totaling $11.9 million and $5.3 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These investments are primarily equity instruments in privately-held entities over which we do not exercise significant influence or control. We generally account for these investments at fair value on a recurring basis; however, these investments do not have readily determinable fair value. We have elected the practical expedient in ASC Topic 321, Investments-Equity Securities, to measure these investments at cost less any impairment adjusted for observable price changes, if any. As such, these investments are excluded from the fair value hierarchy.\nDuring the year ended August 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges totaling $6.0 million for two of these investments, one due to the recapitalization of the underlying company diluting our value and one due to a deterioration in the financial condition and long-term prospects of the underlying company. These impairment charges are reflected in Miscellaneous (income) expense, net for the year ended August 31, 2021 within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nChanges in the fair values of these financial instruments during the year ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nDisclosures of Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nDisclosures of fair value information about financial instruments, for which it is practicable to estimate that value, are required each reporting period in addition to any financial instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis as prescribed by ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments (ASC 825). In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows.\nFair value for our outstanding debt obligations is estimated based on discounted future cash flows using rates currently available for debt of similar terms and maturity (Level 2). Our senior unsecured public notes are carried at the outstanding balance, net of unamortized bond discount and deferred costs, as of the end of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of our senior unsecured public notes was $399.2 million and $496.5 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in fair value is due to increases in market bond yields since the end of fiscal 2021. As of August 31, 2022, we also had $18.0 million of short-term borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. These borrowings are variable-rate instruments that reset on a frequent short-term basis; therefore, we estimate that the carrying values, which is equal to the face amounts, of these instruments approximate their fair values as of August 31, 2022. See Debt and Lines of Credit footnote for further details on our outstanding borrowings.\nASC 825 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to us. In many cases, the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the disclosed value be realized in immediate settlement of the instruments. In evaluating our management of liquidity and other risks, the fair values of all assets and liabilities should be taken into consideration, not only those presented above.\nNote 6 - Leases\nWe lease property and equipment under operating lease arrangements, most of which relate to distribution centers and manufacturing facilities in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. We include both the contractual term as well as any renewal option that we are reasonably certain to exercise in the determination of our lease terms. For leases with a term of greater than 12 months, we value lease liabilities as the present value of the lease payments over the related term. Related assets are equal to the calculated lease liabilities adjusted for incentives and other items as prescribed by ASC Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842). Lease payments generally consist of fixed amounts, and variable amounts based on a market rate or an index are not material to our consolidated lease cost. We have elected to use the practical expedient present in ASC 842 to not separate lease and non-lease components for all\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nsignificant underlying asset classes and instead account for them together as a single lease component in the measurement of our lease liabilities.\nWe apply the short-term lease exception to leases with a term of 12 months or less and exclude such leases from our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payments related to these short-term leases are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and reflected as a component of lease cost within our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nGenerally, the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable. Therefore, we discount future lease payments using our estimated incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement. We determine this rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate, which approximates a secured rate over the lease term. The weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.5% and 2.0% as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table presents the future undiscounted payments due on our operating lease liabilities as well as a reconciliation of those payments to our operating lease liabilities recorded as of the date presented (in millions):\nFiscal year August 31, 2022\n2023 $ 17.3\n2024 17.0\n2025 15.6\n2026 11.5\n2027 8.5\nThereafter 21.1\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 91.0\nLess: Discount due to interest (7.9)\nPresent value of lease liabilities $ 83.1\nThe weighted average remaining lease term for our operating leases was six years as of August 31, 2022.\nLease cost is recorded within Cost of products sold, and may be capitalized into inventory as manufacturing overhead, or Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on the primary use of the related right of use (ROU) asset. The components of total lease cost were as follows during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nOperating lease cost $ 18.8 $ 18.3 $ 18.1\nVariable lease cost 2.7 2.0 2.3\nShort-term lease cost 4.3 2.2 2.8\nTotal lease cost $ 25.8 $ 22.5 $ 23.2\nCash paid for operating lease liabilities during the year ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $18.5 million, $26.2 million, and $18.7 million, respectively. ROU assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities during the year ended August 31, 2022 and 2021 were $37.3 million and $12.9 million, respectively.\nWe have entered into an agreement to lease a production facility in Mexico currently under construction that has not commenced as of August 31, 2022. This lease has an estimated term of ten years and estimated gross payments of approximately $18.0 million, which are subject to changes based on a consumer price index throughout the lease term. We expect the lease to commence during fiscal 2023. We have no other significant leases that have not yet commenced as of August 31, 2022 that create significant rights and obligations.\nWe have subleased certain properties. Lease income from these subleases is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income as it is earned and is not material to our consolidated results of operations. We do not have any other significant transactions in which we are the lessor.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, we committed to plans to vacate certain leased properties, which indicated that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the related ROU assets were below their carrying values. We assessed the recoverability of these assets using an undiscounted cash flow model and concluded that the carrying values of the assets were not fully recoverable. We recorded impairment charges of $1.7 million and $7.4 million related to these assets using a discounted cash flow model to estimate their fair values in fiscal 2022 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2022 and 2020 impairments were recorded within Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses and Special charges, respectively in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The recoverability and impairment tests required significant assumptions including estimated future cash flows, the identification of assets within each asset group, and the determination of appropriate discount rates. No impairments were recorded for leases in fiscal 2021.\nNote 7 - Debt and Lines of Credit\nOur debt is carried at the outstanding balance net of any related unamortized discounts and deferred costs and consists of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nSenior unsecured public notes due December 2030, principal $ 500.0 $ 500.0\nSenior unsecured public notes due December 2030, unamortized discount and deferred costs (5.0) (5.7)\nShort-term borrowings under credit facility 18.0 -\nTotal debt $ 513.0 $ 494.3\nOur next scheduled future principal payment of long-term debt is $500.0 million due upon the maturity of the senior unsecured notes in December 2030.\nLong-term Debt\nOn November 10, 2020, Acuity Brands Lighting, Inc. issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.150% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2030 (the Unsecured Notes). The Unsecured Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Acuity Brands, Inc. and ABL IP Holding LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acuity Brands, Inc. The Unsecured Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.150% per annum and were issued at a price equal to 99.737% of their face value. Additionally, we recorded $4.8 million of deferred issuance costs related to the Unsecured Notes as a direct deduction from the face amount of the Unsecured Notes. These issuance costs are amortized over the 10-year term of the Unsecured Notes.\nInterest on the Unsecured Notes is paid semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nLines of Credit\nOn June 30, 2022, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $600.0 million five-year unsecured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) with the ability to request an additional $400.0 million of borrowing capacity. The Revolving Credit Facility replaced our previous credit agreement set to expire on June 30, 2022, the details of which can be found in the fiscal 2021 Debt and Lines of Credit footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Footnotes within our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 27, 2021.\nThe Revolving Credit Facility uses the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the applicable benchmark for U.S. Dollar borrowings and an applicable benchmark rate for non-U.S. Dollar borrowings as defined in the Credit Agreement. The applicable margin pricing grid mechanics are based on the better of our public credit ratings or our net leverage ratio and range from 0.80% to 1.20% for base rate borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.20% for floating rate advances. We are also required to pay certain fees in connection with the Credit Agreement, including administrative service fees and annual facility fees, which range from 0.075% to 0.175% of the aggregate $600.0 million remaining commitment of the lenders under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a leverage ratio covenant (Maximum Leverage Ratio) of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), as such terms are defined in the Credit\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAgreement. These ratios are computed at the end of each fiscal quarter for the most recent 12-month period. The Credit Agreement generally allows for a Maximum Leverage Ratio of 3.75 (subject to temporary increase to 4.25 in the event of a significant acquisition) and allows netting of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents against debt.\nWe were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of August 31, 2022. As of August 31, 2022, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $4.1 million, primarily for securing collateral requirements under our casualty insurance programs. At August 31, 2022, we had additional borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $577.9 million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at the time, which represents the full amount of the Revolving Credit Facility less the outstanding borrowings of $18.0 million and letters of credit of $4.1 million issued under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nNone of our existing debt instruments include provisions that would require an acceleration of repayments based solely on changes in our credit ratings.\nNote 8 - Commitments and Contingencies\nSelf-Insurance\nOur policy is to self-insure up to certain limits traditional risks, including workers compensation, comprehensive general liability, and auto liability. Our self-insured retention for each claim involving workers compensation, comprehensive general liability (including product liability claims), and auto liability is limited per occurrence of such claims. A provision for claims under this self-insured program, based on our estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred, is revised and recorded annually. The estimate is derived from both internal and external sources including, but not limited to, our independent actuary. We are also self-insured up to certain limits for certain other insurable risks, primarily physical loss to property and business interruptions resulting from such loss lasting two days or more in duration. Insurance coverage is maintained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures, as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract. We are fully self-insured for certain other types of liabilities, including environmental, product recall, warranty, and patent infringement. The actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources including, among others, changes in claim reporting patterns, claim settlement patterns, actual claims, judicial decisions, legislation, and economic conditions. Although we believe that the actuarial estimates are reasonable, significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect our self-insurance obligations, future expense, and cash flow.\nWe are also self-insured for the majority of our medical benefit plans up to certain limits. We estimate our aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to our historical claims and administrative cost experience. The appropriateness of our lag factor is evaluated annually and revised as necessary.\nLeases\nWe lease certain of our buildings and equipment under noncancellable lease agreements. Please refer to the Leases footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\nApproximately 66% of our total work force is covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements representing approximately 54% of our work force will expire within one year, primarily due to annual negotiations of union contracts in Mexico.\nShareholder Derivative Complaint\nAs previously disclosed, on October 1, 2021, certain alleged shareholders of the Company filed a putative derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia asserting claims against three former executives for breach of fiduciary duty and certain other claims (the Derivative Complaint). The Company is named as a nominal defendant, and the plaintiffs seek on behalf of the Company unspecified damages from the individual defendants and other relief. Prior to filing the Derivative Complaint, the derivative plaintiffs sent letters to the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) demanding that the Company investigate and pursue substantially the same claims against the individual defendants that are asserted in the Derivative Complaint. The Companys Board formed a demand evaluation committee consisting of independent directors to investigate these matters and make a recommendation to the Board regarding the best interests of the Company in connection therewith. On\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 14, 2021, the Company filed a motion to stay the derivative action pending the conclusion of the related securities class action or, in the alternative, to dismiss the derivative action without prejudice as premature, given the demand evaluation committees ongoing work. Also on December 14, 2021, the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Derivative Complaint for failure to adequately plead any claim for relief against them.\nOn August 3, 2022, the Court entered a stipulated consent order extending the deadline for the individual defendants and the Company to answer, move against, or otherwise respond to the Derivative Complaint until thirty days after the filing of an amended complaint or the designation of an operative complaint. Subsequently, the demand evaluation committee completed its investigation and recommended that the Board reject the demands and direct the Company to seek dismissal of the Derivative Complaint. The Board approved and adopted the recommendation from the committee and rejected the demands and directed the Company to seek dismissal of the Derivative Complaint. The parties advised the Court of the Boards decision during the status conference held on October 6, 2022. The Court directed the parties to submit a written status report within forty-five days as to the litigation.\nEstimating an amount or range of possible losses or gains resulting from litigation proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly where the matters involve indeterminate claims for monetary damages and are in the stages of the proceedings where key evidential and legal issues have not been resolved. For these reasons, we are currently unable to predict the ultimate timing or outcome of or reasonably estimate the possible losses or gains or a range of possible losses or gains resulting from the Derivative Complaint.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various other legal claims arising in the normal course of business, including patent infringement, employment matters, and product liability claims. Based on information currently available, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending and threatened legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of any such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in future periods. We establish estimated liabilities for legal claims when associated costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued for such claims. However, we cannot make a meaningful estimate of actual costs to be incurred that could possibly be higher or lower than the accrued amounts.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to numerous comprehensive laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous substances, as well as solid and hazardous wastes, and to the remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, permits and environmental controls are required for certain operations to limit air and water pollution, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation by issuing authorities. On an ongoing basis, we invest capital and incur operating costs relating to environmental compliance. Environmental laws and regulations have generally become stricter in recent years. We are not aware of any pending legislation or proposed regulation related to environmental issues that would have a material adverse effect. The cost of responding to future changes may be substantial. We establish accruals for known environmental claims when the associated costs become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual cost of environmental issues may be substantially higher than that accrued due to difficulty in estimating such costs.\nGuarantees and Indemnities\nWe are a party to contracts entered into in the normal course of business in which it is common for us to agree to indemnify third parties for certain liabilities that may arise out of or relate to the subject matter of the contract. In most cases, we cannot estimate the potential amount of future payments under these indemnities until events arise that would result in a liability under the indemnities.\nProduct Warranty and Recall Costs\nOur products generally have a standard warranty term of five years that assure our products comply with agreed upon specifications. We record an accrual for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (ASC 450). Estimated future warranty\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand recall costs are primarily based on historical experience of identified warranty and recall claims. Estimated costs related to product warranty and recall costs outside of our historical experience, which could include significant product recalls or formal campaigns soliciting repair or return of a product, are accrued when they are deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Any estimated or actual loss recoveries that offset our costs and payments are reflected as assets and included within Other current assets or Other long-term assets based on the timing of receipt of recovery.\nThere can be no assurance that future warranty or recall costs will not exceed historical amounts or that new technology products may not generate unexpected costs. If actual future warranty or recall costs exceed historical amounts, additional increases in the accrual may be required, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nEstimated liabilities for product warranty and recall costs are included in Other accrued liabilities or Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets based upon when we expect to settle the incurred warranty. The following table summarizes changes in the estimated liabilities for product warranty and recall costs during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nBeginning balance $ 20.3 $ 16.1 $ 11.5\nWarranty and recall costs(1)\n52.4 32.3 32.0\nPayments and other deductions(1)\n(45.4) (28.4) (27.5)\nAcquired warranty and recall liabilities - 0.3 0.1\nEnding balance $ 27.3 $ 20.3 $ 16.1\n____________________________\n(1) Amounts exclude any estimated or actual loss recoveries.\nNote 9 - Segment Information\nWe present our financial results of operations for our two reportable segments, ABL and ISG, consistent with how our chief operating decision maker evaluates operating results, assesses performance, and allocates resources within the Company.\nThe accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those described in the Significant Accounting Policies footnote of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Corporate expenses that are primarily administrative in function and benefit the Company on an entity-wide basis are not allocated to our segments. These include expenses related to governance, policy setting, compliance, and certain other shared services functions. Additionally, we do not allocate net interest expense, net miscellaneous expense, special charges, or assets to our segments. Accordingly, this information is not used by the chief operating decision maker to make operating decisions and assess performance and is therefore excluded from our disclosures.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents financial information by operating segment for the periods presented (in millions):\nABL ISG Corporate Eliminations(1)\nTotal\nYear Ended August 31, 2022:\nNet sales $ 3,810.1 $ 216.1 $ - $ (20.1) $ 4,006.1\nOperating profit (loss) 545.6 22.7 (58.6) - 509.7\nDepreciation and amortization 79.3 14.4 1.1 - 94.8\nYear Ended August 31, 2021:\nNet sales $ 3,287.3 $ 190.0 $ - $ (16.3) $ 3,461.0\nOperating profit (loss) 476.2 9.9 (58.5) - 427.6\nDepreciation and amortization 84.3 14.7 1.1 - 100.1\nYear Ended August 31, 2020:\nNet sales $ 3,180.9 $ 157.0 $ - $ (11.6) $ 3,326.3\nOperating profit (loss) 425.8 (3.9) (68.0) - 353.9\nDepreciation and amortization 83.7 16.3 1.1 - 101.1\n____________________________\n(1) This column represents intersegment sales.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for goods and services and is recognized net of rebates, sales incentives, product returns, and discounts to customers. We allocate the expected consideration to be collected to each distinct performance obligation identified in a sale based on its standalone selling price. Sales and use taxes collected on behalf of governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nPayment is generally due and received within 60 days from the point of sale. In some instances, such as for software as a service agreements, payment is made prior to the transfer of control of goods and services. Payment terms generally do not extend beyond one year, and we apply the significant financing component practical expedient within ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Accruals for cash discounts to customers are estimated using the expected value method based on historical experience and are recorded as a reduction to sales.\nOur standard terms and conditions of sale generally allow for the return of certain products within four months of the date of shipment. We also provide for limited product return rights to certain distributors and other customers, primarily for slow moving or damaged items subject to certain defined criteria. The limited product return rights generally allow customers to return resalable products purchased within a specified time period and subject to certain limitations, including, at times, when accompanied by a replacement order of equal or greater value. At the time revenue is recognized, we record a refund liability for the expected value of future returns primarily based on historical experience, specific notification of pending returns, or contractual terms with the respective customers. Although historical product returns generally have been within expectations, there can be no assurance that future product returns will not exceed historical amounts. A significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results in future periods.\nRefund liabilities recorded under ASC 606 related to rights of return, cash discounts, and other miscellaneous credits to customers were $28.0 million and $28.1 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reflected within Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Additionally, we record right of return assets for products expected to be returned to our distribution centers, which are included within Prepayments and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such assets totaled $3.7 million and $6.4 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nWe also maintain one-time and ongoing promotions with our customers, which may include rebate, sales incentive, marketing, and trade-promotion programs with certain customers that require us to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs. These arrangements may include volume rebate incentives, cooperative marketing programs, merchandising of our products, introductory marketing funds for new products, and other trade-promotion activities conducted by the customer. Costs associated with these programs are generally estimated based on the most likely amount expected to be settled based on the context of the individual contract and are reflected within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income in accordance with ASC 606, which in most instances requires such costs to be recorded as reductions of revenue. Amounts due to our customers associated with these programs totaled $40.7 million and $33.9 million as of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and are reflected within Other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCosts to obtain and fulfill contracts, such as sales commissions, are generally short-term in nature and are expensed as incurred.\nNature of Goods and Services\nProducts\nSubstantially all of the revenues for the periods presented were generated from short-term contracts with our customers to deliver only tangible goods such as luminaires, lighting controls, and controls for various building systems. We record revenue from these contracts when the customer obtains control of those goods. For sales designated free on board shipping point, control is transferred and revenue is recognized at the time of shipment. For sales designated free on board destination, customers take control and revenue is recognized when a product is delivered to the customers delivery site.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nProfessional Services\nWe collect fees associated with training, installation, and technical support services, primarily related to the set up of our lighting and building technology solutions. We recognize revenue for these one-time services at the time the service is performed. We also sell certain service-type warranties that extend coverages for products beyond their base warranties. We account for service-type warranties as distinct performance obligations and recognize revenue for these contracts ratably over the life of the additional warranty period. We allocate transaction price to our service-type warranties largely based on expectations of cost plus margin based on our estimate of future claims. These estimates are subject to a higher level of estimation uncertainty than other estimates, as we have less experience in costs in the extended warranty period. Claims related to service-type warranties are expensed as incurred.\nSoftware\nSoftware sales include licenses for software, data usage fees, and software as a service arrangements, which generally extend for one year or less. We recognize revenue for software based on the contractual rights provided to a customer, which typically results in the recognition of revenue ratably over the contractual service period.\nShipping and Handling Activities\nWe account for all shipping and handling activities for customers as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer products to our customers. As such, we do not consider shipping and handling activities to be separate performance obligations, and we expense these costs as incurred.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nA small portion of our revenue was derived from the combination of any or all of our products, professional services, and software licenses. Significant judgment may be required to determine which performance obligations are distinct and should be accounted for separately. We allocate the expected consideration to be collected to each distinct performance obligation based on its standalone selling price. Standalone selling price is generally determined using a cost plus margin valuation when no observable input is available. The amount of consideration allocated to each performance obligation is recognized as revenue in accordance with the timing for products, professional services, and software as described above.\nContract Balances\nOur rights related to collections from customers are unconditional and are reflected within Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any other significant contract assets. Contract liabilities arise when we receive cash or an unconditional right to collect cash prior to the transfer of control of goods or services.\nThe amount of transaction price from contracts with customers allocated to our contract liabilities consist of the following as of the dates presented (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nCurrent deferred revenues $ 11.4 $ 7.7\nNon-current deferred revenues 53.1 56.7\nCurrent deferred revenues primarily consist of software licenses as well as professional service and service-type warranty fees collected prior to performing the related service and are included within Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These services are expected to be performed within one year. Revenue earned from beginning contract balances during the year ended August 31, 2022 approximated the current deferred revenue balance at August 31, 2021.\nNon-current deferred revenues primarily consist of long-term service-type warranties, which are typically recognized ratably as revenue between five years and ten years from the date of sale, and are included within Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnsatisfied performance obligations that do not represent contract liabilities are expected to be satisfied within one year from August 31, 2022 and consist primarily of orders for physical goods that have not yet been shipped.\nDisaggregated Revenues\nOur ABL segment's lighting and lighting controls are sold primarily through independent sales agents who cover specific geographic areas and market channels, by internal sales representatives, through consumer retail channels, directly to large corporate accounts, and through other distribution methods, including directly to original equipment manufacturer customers. ISG sells predominantly to system integrators. The following table shows revenue from contracts with customers by sales channel and reconciles to our segment information for the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nABL:\nIndependent sales network $ 2,714.1 $ 2,400.5 $ 2,284.3\nDirect sales network 384.2 358.1 329.0\nRetail sales 178.3 181.5 218.3\nCorporate accounts 222.7 168.7 191.8\nOther 310.8 178.5 157.5\nTotal ABL 3,810.1 3,287.3 3,180.9\nISG 216.1 190.0 157.0\nEliminations (20.1) (16.3) (11.6)\nTotal $ 4,006.1 $ 3,461.0 $ 3,326.3\nNote 11 - Share-based Payments\nOmnibus Stock Compensation Incentive and Directors Equity Plans\nIn January 2022, our stockholders approved the Amended and Restated Acuity Brands, Inc. 2012 Omnibus Stock Compensation Incentive Plan (the Stock Incentive Plan), which, among other things, increased the total number of shares authorized for issuance pursuant to the Stock Incentive Plan from 2.7 million to 3.6 million, with a corresponding increase to shares available for grant. The Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee\") is authorized to issue awards consisting of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance stock awards, performance stock units, stock bonus awards, and cash-based awards to eligible employees, non-employee directors, and outside consultants.\nShares available for grant under the Stock Incentive Plan were approximately 1.1 million, 0.3 million, and 0.7 million at August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Any shares subject to an award under the Stock Incentive Plan that are forfeited, canceled, expired, or settled for cash will be available for future grant under the Stock Incentive Plan.\nRestricted stock awards, performance stock awards, and director stock units representing certain deferrals into the Director Plan are valued based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date. We review the values of our performance awards on a frequent and recurring basis and adjust those values based on the probability that the related performance metric will be satisfied. We utilize the Black-Scholes model in deriving the fair value estimates of our stock option awards that only have a service requirement, and we utilize the Monte Carlo simulation model to determine grant date fair value estimates of stock options also subject to a market condition.\nRestricted stock and performance stock awards granted from October 2019 to September 2020 provided for the continued vesting of stock awards following retirement for all eligible participants who have attained age 60 and have at least ten years of service with the Company. We deem the requisite service period for these awards for a participant to be the shorter of either the award's stated vesting period or the time from grant until the participant satisfies the age and service criteria. This provision was removed from any restricted stock and performance stock awards granted during or after October 2020.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEffective for performance stock unit grants awarded in fiscal 2021 and after, the Compensation Committee amended the retirement provision to provide that a portion of any performance stock unit granted becomes non-forfeitable on the anniversary of the date of grant if the recipient has five years of service.\nWe generally recognize compensation cost for share-based payment transactions on a straight-line basis over an award's requisite service period as defined by ASC 718. In certain circumstances, such as when a performance award is subject to graded vesting, we apply the accelerated attribution method to recognize compensation cost related to our share-based payment awards.\nCompensation expense recognized related to the awards under the current and prior equity incentive plans during the periods presented is summarized as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nRestricted stock awards and units $ 17.2 $ 15.1 $ 24.6\nStock options 8.8 9.2 4.9\nPerformance stock units 9.9 6.8 7.3\nDirector stock units 1.5 1.4 1.4\nTotal share-based payment expense $ 37.4 $ 32.5 $ 38.2\nRestricted Stock\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had approximately 0.3 million shares outstanding of restricted stock to officers, directors, and other key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan. Grants awarded prior to fiscal 2022 vest primarily over a four-year period, and grants awarded beginning in fiscal 2022 vest primarily over a three-year period. Our restricted stock grants are valued at the closing stock price on the date of the grant.\nActivity related to restricted stock awards during the periods presented was as follows (in millions, except per share data):\nNumber of\nShares Weighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value Per\nShare\nOutstanding at August 31, 2019 0.4 $ 156.32\nGranted 0.2 $ 122.10\nVested (0.1) $ 171.92\nForfeited (0.1) $ 135.43\nOutstanding at August 31, 2020 0.4 $ 134.68\nGranted 0.2 $ 108.79\nVested (0.1) $ 150.44\nForfeited (0.1) $ 116.33\nOutstanding at August 31, 2021 0.4 $ 116.77\nGranted 0.1 $ 204.36\nVested (0.1) $ 122.27\nForfeited (0.1) $ 131.08\nOutstanding at August 31, 2022 0.3 $ 144.51\nAs of August 31, 2022, there was $30.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years. The total fair value of stock vested during the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was approximately $16.4 million, $19.5 million, and $22.8 million, respectively.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStock Options\nAs of August 31, 2022, we had approximately 1.1 million options outstanding to officers and other key employees under the Stock Incentive Plan, all of which were granted in previous fiscal years. Of these options, 0.7 million were granted in fiscal 2020 or prior and vest and become exercisable over a three-year period (the \"Service Options\"). The remaining 0.4 million were granted in fiscal 2021 and 2020, become exercisable over a four-year period, and are also subject to a market condition (the \"Market Options\"). Options issued under the Stock Incentive Plan are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant, but never less than the fair market value on the grant date, and expire 10 years from the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each Service Option was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model, and the fair value of each Market Option was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The dividend yield was calculated based on annual dividends paid and the trailing 12-month average closing stock price at the time of grant. Expected volatility was based on historical volatility of our stock, calculated using the most recent time period equal to the expected life of the options. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield for a term equal to the expected life of the options at the time of grant for the Service Options and equal to the contractual term for the Market Options. We used historical exercise behavior data of similar employee groups to determine the expected life of the Service Options. The expected life of the Market Options is based on projected exercise dates resulting from the Monte Carlo simulation for each award tranche. All inputs noted above are estimates made at the time of grant. All inputs into the Black-Scholes model and the Monte Carlo simulation are estimates made at the time of grant.

As of August 31, 2022, the total intrinsic value of options outstanding was $40.6 million, the total intrinsic value of options expected to vest was $18.8 million, and the total intrinsic value of options exercisable was $21.4 million. As of August 31, 2022, there was $8.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested options. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.7 years.\nPerformance Stock Units\nBeginning in fiscal 2020, the Board approved grants of performance stock units to certain executives and key employees. These grants vest primarily over a three-year period and are valued at the closing stock price at the date of grant. The actual number of performance stock units earned for these awards will be determined at the end of the related performance period based on the level of achievement of established performance thresholds. We recognize compensation expense for these grants proportionately over the requisite service period for each employee when it becomes probable that the performance metric will be satisfied. For performance stock units subject to graded vesting, we apply the accelerated attribution method for expense recognition. As of August 31, 2022, we had approximately 0.2 million performance stock units outstanding.\nAs of August 31, 2022 there was $9.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested performance stock units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\nEmployee Deferred Stock Units\nWe previously allowed employees to defer a portion of restricted stock awards granted in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 into the SDSP as stock units. The stock units are payable in shares of stock at the time of distribution from the SDSP. As of August 31, 2022, approximately 7,000 fully vested stock units remain deferred, but undistributed, under the Stock Incentive Plan. There was no compensation expense related to these stock units during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDirector Deferred Stock Units\nIn January 2022, the total remaining shares available for issuance under the Director Plan were transferred into the Stock Incentive Plan. As of August 31, 2022, approximately 0.1 million stock units were deferred but undistributed under the Director Plan.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nEmployees are able to purchase, through payroll deduction, common stock at a 5% discount on a monthly basis. There were 1.5 million shares of our common stock reserved for purchase under the plan, of which approximately 1.0 million shares remain available as of August 31, 2022. Employees may participate at their discretion.\nNote 12 - Pension and Defined Contribution Plans\nCompany-sponsored Pension Plans\nWe have several pension plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering certain hourly and salaried employees. Benefits paid under these plans are based generally on employees years of service and/or compensation during the final years of employment. We historically have made at least the minimum annual contributions to the plans to the extent indicated by actuarial valuations and statutory requirements. Plan assets are invested primarily in equity and fixed income securities. Current period net actuarial gains in our projected benefit obligation primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate from our prior year valuation.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables reflect the status of our domestic (U.S.-based) and international pension plans as of the dates presented (in millions):\nDomestic Plans International Plans\nAugust 31, August 31,\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 224.7 $ 249.6 $ 52.6 $ 49.2\nService cost 4.4 4.6 0.4 0.3\nInterest cost 5.3 5.3 0.9 0.9\nActuarial (gains) losses (43.1) (5.2) (17.1) 1.7\nBenefits paid (15.3) (29.6) (2.1) (1.3)\nOther - - (3.2) 1.8\nBenefit obligation at end of year 176.0 224.7 31.5 52.6\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year 182.6 167.1 42.2 35.1\nActual return on plan assets (33.6) 21.7 (11.6) 5.3\nEmployer contributions 7.8 23.4 3.0 2.1\nBenefits paid (15.3) (29.6) (2.1) (1.3)\nOther - - (3.0) 1.0\nFair value of plan assets at end of year 141.5 182.6 28.5 42.2\nFunded status at the end of year $ (34.5) $ (42.1) $ (3.0) $ (10.4)\nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:\nNon-current assets $ 7.6 $ 13.0 $ 0.4 $ -\nCurrent liabilities (3.9) (5.2) (0.2) (0.1)\nNon-current liabilities (38.2) (49.9) (3.2) (10.3)\nNet amount recognized in consolidated balance sheets $ (34.5) $ (42.1) $ (3.0) $ (10.4)\nAccumulated benefit obligation $ 175.3 $ 223.8 $ 31.3 $ 51.7\nPre-tax amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss:\nPrior service cost $ (2.7) $ (5.6) $ (0.1) $ (0.1)\nNet actuarial loss (54.2) (55.2) (6.5) (11.3)\nAmounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$ (56.9) $ (60.8) $ (6.6) $ (11.4)\nPensions plans in which benefit obligation exceeds plan assets:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 42.1 $ 81.7 $ 3.4 $ 52.6\nAccumulated benefit obligation 41.4 80.8 2.3 51.7\nPlan assets - 26.6 - 42.2\nPensions plans in which plan assets exceed benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation $ 133.9 $ 143.0 $ 28.1 $ -\nAccumulated benefit obligation 133.9 143.0 29.0 -\nPlan assets 141.5 156.0 28.5 -\nService cost of net periodic pension cost is allocated between Cost of products sold, and may be capitalized into inventory as labor costs, and Selling, distribution, and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income based on the function of the employee's services. All other components of net periodic pension cost are included within Miscellaneous (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. We utilize a corridor approach to amortize cumulative unrecognized actuarial gains or losses over either the average expected future service of active participants or average life expectancy of plan participants based on each plans composition. The corridor is determined as the greater of the excess of 10% of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at each valuation date. Amounts related to prior service cost are amortized over the average remaining expected future service period for active participants in each plan.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNet periodic pension cost during the periods presented included the following components before tax (in millions):\nDomestic Plans International Plans\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nService cost $ 4.4 $ 4.6 $ 4.3 $ 0.4 $ 0.3 $ 0.3\nInterest cost 5.3 5.3 6.4 0.9 0.9 0.9\nExpected return on plan assets (11.2) (11.0) (10.4) (2.6) (2.3) (2.0)\nAmortization of prior service cost 2.9 2.9 4.0 - - -\nSettlement 0.4 3.9 - - - -\nRecognized actuarial loss 2.4 4.1 4.2 0.9 1.4 1.4\nNet periodic pension cost $ 4.2 $ 9.8 $ 8.5 $ (0.4) $ 0.3 $ 0.6\nWeighted average assumptions used in computing the benefit obligation are as follows:\nDomestic Plans International Plans\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nDiscount rate 4.4 % 2.4 % 4.9 % 1.9 %\nRate of compensation increase 5.0 % 5.0 % 3.5 % 3.4 %\nWeighted average assumptions used in computing net periodic pension cost are as follows:\nDomestic Plans International Plans\n2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020\nDiscount rate 2.4 % 2.2 % 2.8 % 1.9 % 1.9 % 2.0 %\nExpected return on plan assets 6.3 % 6.8 % 7.0 % 6.4 % 6.5 % 6.5 %\nRate of compensation increase 5.0 % 5.0 % 5.0 % 3.4 % 3.4 % 3.0 %\nIt is our policy to adjust, on an annual basis, the discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation to approximate rates on high-quality, long-term obligations based on our estimated benefit payments available as of the measurement date. We use published yield curves to assist in the development of our discount rates. We estimate that a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would reduce net periodic pension cost approximately $0.6 million for the domestic plans and $0.5 million for the international plans. The expected return on plan assets is derived primarily from a periodic study of long-term historical rates of return on the various asset classes included in our targeted pension plan asset allocation as well as future expectations. We estimate that each 100 basis point reduction in the expected return on plan assets would result in additional net periodic pension cost of $1.6 million and $0.3 million for domestic plans and international plans, respectively. We also evaluate the rate of compensation increase annually and adjust if necessary.\nOur investment objective for domestic plan assets is to earn a rate of return sufficient to exceed the long-term growth of the plans liabilities without subjecting plan assets to undue risk. The plan assets are invested primarily in high quality debt and equity securities. We conduct a periodic strategic asset allocation study to form a basis for the allocation of pension assets between various asset categories. Specific allocation percentages are assigned to each asset category with minimum and maximum ranges established for each. The assets are then managed within these ranges. At August 31, 2022, the U.S. targeted asset allocation was 30% equity securities, 65% fixed income securities, and 5% real estate securities. Our investment objective for the international plan assets is also to add value by exceeding the long-term growth of the plans liabilities. At August 31, 2022, the international asset target allocation approximated 15% equity securities, 25% fixed income securities, and 60% multi-strategy investments.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur pension plan asset allocation by asset category as of the dates presented is as follows:\n% of Plan Assets\nDomestic Plans International Plans\n2022 2021 2022 2021\nEquity securities 31.6 % 41.2 % 16.8 % 16.1 %\nFixed income securities 61.2 % 54.3 % 22.8 % 20.1 %\nMulti-strategy investments - % - % 60.4 % 63.8 %\nReal estate 7.2 % 4.5 % - % - %\nTotal 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nOur pension plan assets are stated at fair value based on quoted market prices in an active market, quoted redemption values, or estimates based on reasonable assumptions as of the most recent measurement period. See the Fair Value Measurements footnote for a description of the fair value guidance. No transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy occurred during the current fiscal period. In the event of a transfer in or out of a level within the fair value hierarchy, the transfers would be recognized on the date of occurrence. Certain pension assets valued at net asset value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. Investments in pension plan assets are described in further detail below.\nShort-term Fixed Income Investments\nShort-term investments consist of money market funds, which are valued at the daily closing price as reported by the relevant fund (Level 1).\nMutual Funds\nMutual funds held by the domestic plans are open-end mutual funds that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and seek to either replicate or outperform a related index. These funds are required to publish their daily net asset value and to transact at that price. The mutual funds held by the domestic plans are deemed to be actively traded (Level 1).\nCollective Trust\nThe collective trust seeks to outperform the overall small-cap stock market and is comprised primarily of small-cap equity securities with quoted prices in active markets for identical investments. The value of this fund is calculated on each business day based on its daily net asset value; however, the collective trust is not deemed to be actively traded (Level 2).\nFixed Income Investments\nThe fixed income fund seeks to maximize total return by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of intermediate and long-term debt securities and is valued using the NAV of units of a management investment companys trust. The NAV, as provided by the fund's trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value. As such, these funds are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments held by the fund less the fund's liabilities.\nReal Estate Fund\nThe real estate fund invests primarily in commercial real estate and includes mortgage loans that are backed by the associated property's investment objective. The fund seeks real estate returns, risk, and liquidity appropriate to a core fund. The fund also seeks to provide current income with the potential for long-term capital appreciation. This investment is valued based on the NAV per share, without further adjustment. The NAV, as provided by the fund's trustee, is used as a practical expedient to estimate fair value and is therefore excluded from the fair value hierarchy. NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Investors may request to redeem all or any portion of their shares on a quarterly basis. Each investor must provide a written redemption request at least sixty days prior to the end of the quarter for which the request is to be effective. If insufficient funds are available to honor all redemption requests at any point in time, available funds will be allocated pro-rata based on the total number of\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nshares held by each investor. All decisions regarding whether to honor redemption requests are made by the funds board of directors.\nThe following tables present the fair value of the domestic pension plan assets by major category as of the dates presented (in millions):\nFair Value Measurements\nFair Value\nas of Quoted Market\nPrices in Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nAugust 31, 2022 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets included in the fair value hierarchy:\nMutual funds:\nDomestic large cap equity fund $ 23.7 $ 23.7 $ - $ -\nForeign equity fund 12.6 12.6 - -\nCollective trust: Domestic small cap equities 8.4 - 8.4 -\nShort-term fixed income investments 2.1 2.1 - -\nTotal assets in the fair value hierarchy 46.8\nAssets calculated at net asset value:\nFixed-income investments 84.5\nReal estate fund 10.2\nTotal assets at net asset value 94.7\nTotal assets at fair value $ 141.5\nFair Value Measurements\nFair Value\nas of Quoted Market\nPrices in Active\nMarkets for\nIdentical Assets Significant\nOther\nObservable\nInputs Significant\nUnobservable\nInputs\nAugust 31, 2021 (Level 1) (Level 2) (Level 3)\nAssets included in the fair value hierarchy:\nMutual funds:\nDomestic large cap equity fund $ 38.9 $ 38.9 $ - $ -\nForeign equity fund 23.1 23.1 - -\nCollective trust: Domestic small cap equities 13.3 - 13.3 -\nShort-term fixed income investments 6.9 6.9 - -\nTotal assets in the fair value hierarchy 82.2\nAssets calculated at net asset value:\nFixed-income investments 92.3\nReal estate fund 8.1\nTotal assets at net asset value 100.4\nTotal assets at fair value $ 182.6\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInternational Plan Investments\nThe international plans' assets consist primarily of funds invested in equity securities, multi-strategy investments, and fixed income investments.

The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\nAssets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be shared by the remaining participating employers.\nIf a participating employer chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the employer may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nOur contributions to these plans were $0.5 million for the year ended August 31, 2022, and $0.6 million for the years ended August 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe have defined contribution plans to which both employees and we make contributions. Employer matching amounts are allocated in accordance with the participants investment elections for elective deferrals and totaled $10.5 million, $8.4 million, and $8.2 million for the years ended August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. At August 31, 2022, assets of the domestic defined contribution plans included shares of our common stock with a market value of approximately $7.3 million, which represented approximately 1.7% of the total fair market value of the assets in our domestic defined contribution plans.\nNote 13 - Common Stock and Related Matters\nCommon Stock\nChanges in common stock during the periods presented were as follows (amounts and shares in millions):\nCommon Stock\nShares Amount\n(At par)\nBalance at August 31, 2019 53.8 $ 0.5\nIssuance of restricted stock grants, net of cancellations 0.1 -\nBalance at August 31, 2020 53.9 0.5\nIssuance of restricted stock grants, net of cancellations 0.1 -\nStock options exercised - * -\nBalance at August 31, 2021 54.0 0.5\nIssuance of restricted stock grants, net of cancellations 0.1 -\nStock options exercised 0.1 -\nBalance at August 31, 2022 54.2 $ 0.5\n___________________________\n* Represents shares of less than 0.1 million.\nAs of August 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 21.8 million and 18.8 million of repurchased shares recorded as treasury stock at an original repurchase cost of $2.18 billion and $1.66 billion, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares of our outstanding common stock. As of August 31, 2022, the maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board equaled 2.8 million shares.

No shares of preferred stock were issued in fiscal 2022 or 2021, and no shares of preferred stock are outstanding.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share for the periods presented is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for these periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed similarly but reflects the potential dilution that would occur if dilutive options were exercised, unvested share-based payment awards were vested, and other distributions related to deferred stock agreements were incurred. The dilutive effects of share-based payment awards subject to market and/or performance conditions that were not met during the period are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nThe following table calculates basic earnings per common share and diluted earnings per common share during the periods presented (in millions, except per share data):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet income $ 384.0 $ 306.3 $ 248.3\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 34.182 36.284 39.453\nCommon stock equivalents 0.463 0.270 0.148\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 34.645 36.554 39.601\nBasic earnings per share(1)\n$ 11.23 $ 8.44 $ 6.29\nDiluted earnings per share(1)\n$ 11.08 $ 8.38 $ 6.27\n____________________\n(1) Earnings per share is calculated using unrounded numbers.

This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of an asset or liability.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax rate applicable for our fiscal 2024 taxable year and a 1% federal excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following components during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nProvision for current federal taxes $ 67.6 $ 65.4 $ 54.6\nProvision for current state taxes 16.3 12.8 12.5\nProvision for current foreign taxes 25.4 14.4 16.0\nProvision for (benefit from) deferred taxes 0.6 (2.7) (6.7)\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 109.9 $ 89.9 $ 76.4\nThe following table reconciles the provision at the federal statutory rate to the total provision for income taxes during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nFederal income tax computed at statutory rate $ 103.7 $ 83.2 $ 68.2\nState income tax, net of federal income tax benefit 13.5 10.7 9.7\nFederal permanent differences (4.3) 0.6 0.9\nForeign permanent differences and rate differential 4.3 2.4 2.4\nResearch and development tax credits (7.6) (7.6) (7.1)\nUnrecognized tax benefits 2.1 0.7 1.8\nOther, net (1.8) (0.1) 0.5\nTotal provision for income taxes $ 109.9 $ 89.9 $ 76.4\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nComponents of the net deferred income tax liabilities as of the dates presented include (in millions):\nAugust 31,\n2022 2021\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nDepreciation $ (18.6) $ (19.0)\nGoodwill and intangibles (154.2) (155.2)\nOperating lease right of use asset (18.3) (14.3)\nOther liabilities (7.4) (8.2)\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities (198.5) (196.7)\nDeferred income tax assets:\nSelf-insurance 1.6 1.8\nPension 7.1 9.9\nDeferred compensation 22.2 21.3\nNet operating losses 5.8 5.4\nOther accruals not yet deductible 42.9 41.3\nOperating lease liabilities 20.3 15.4\nOther assets 9.3 12.0\nTotal deferred income tax assets 109.2 107.1\nValuation allowance (11.5) (9.5)\nNet deferred income tax liabilities $ (100.8) $ (99.1)\nAs of August 31, 2022, the estimated undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries was $204.0 million. We have recorded a deferred income tax liability of $3.2 million for certain foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state taxes related to foreign earnings for which we do not assert indefinite reinvestment. With respect to unremitted earnings and original investments in foreign subsidiaries where we are continuing to assert indefinite reinvestment, any future remittances could be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes, U.S. state taxes, and certain tax impacts relating to foreign currency exchange effects. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of any unrecognized tax effects on these reinvested earnings and original investments in foreign subsidiaries. We account for the tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as a period cost and, therefore, do not record deferred taxes related to GILTI on our foreign subsidiaries.\nAt August 31, 2022, we had federal tax credit carryforwards of approximately $4.9 million that begin to expire in 2029, and state tax credit carryforwards of less than $0.1 million, that begin to expire in 2028. The $4.9 million in federal tax credit carryforwards are subject to a full valuation allowance as we do not expect to realize any future tax benefit. At August 31, 2022, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $13.6 million that begin to expire in 2029, state net operating loss carryforwards of $33.9 million that begin to expire in 2023, and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $7.1 million that begin to expire in 2028.\nThe gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of August 31, 2022 and 2021 totaled $19.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively, which includes $18.8 million and $17.1 million, respectively, of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the annual effective tax rate. We recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense; such accrued interest and penalties are not material. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to United States federal, state, and local income tax examinations for years ended before 2016 or for foreign income tax examinations before 2017. We do not anticipate unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nACUITY BRANDS, INC\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table reconciles the change in the unrecognized income tax benefit (reported in Other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets) during the periods presented (in millions):\nYear Ended August 31,\n2022 2021 2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of year $ 17.7 $ 17.2 $ 16.6\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year 3.5 5.2 2.3\nAdditions for tax positions of prior years 0.1 0.1 -\nReductions for tax positions of prior years (0.2) (0.1) (0.4)\nReductions due to settlements - (4.6) (1.2)\nReductions due to lapse of statute of limitations (1.6) (0.1) (0.1)\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end of year $ 19.5 $ 17.7 $ 17.2\nTotal accrued interest was $2.1 million, $2.0 million, and $1.7 million as of August 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. There were no accruals related to income tax penalties during fiscal 2022. Interest, net of tax benefits, and penalties are included in Income tax expense within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The classification of interest and penalties did not change during the current fiscal year. We are routinely under audit from various tax jurisdictions. We do not currently anticipate material audit assessments.\nNote 15 - Supplemental Disaggregated Information\nSales of lighting, lighting controls, and building technology solutions, excluding services, accounted for approximately 99% of total consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.

Item 9.Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9a.Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to reasonably ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs required by SEC rules, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2022. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level as of August 31, 2022. However, because all disclosure procedures must rely to a significant degree on actions or decisions made by employees throughout the organization, such as reporting of material events, the Company and its reporting officers believe that they cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or errors and omissions, if any, within the Company will be detected. Limitations within any control system, including our control system, include faulty judgments in decision-making or simple errors or mistakes. In addition, controls can be circumvented by an individual, by collusion between two or more people, or by management override of the control. Because of these limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be detected.\nManagements annual report on our internal control over financial reporting and the independent registered public accounting firms attestation report are included in our 2022 Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the headings, Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting and Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm as it relates to Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting Item 9b.Other Information.\nNone.\nItem 9c.Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions That Prevent Inspections.\nNone.\nPART III Item 10.Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance.\nThe information required by this item, with respect to directors and corporate governance, will be included under the caption Item 1 - Election of Directors and Director Information of our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held January 25, 2023, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe information required by this item, with respect to executive officers, will be included under the caption Executive Officers of our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held January 25, 2023, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A, and is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe information required by this item, with respect to the code of ethics, will be included under the captions Governance Policies and Procedures and Contacting the Board of Directors of our proxy statement for the annual meeting of stockholders to be held January 25, 2023, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Regulation 14A, and is incorporated herein by reference.
