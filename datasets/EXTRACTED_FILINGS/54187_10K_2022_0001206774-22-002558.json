    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nJ.W. Mays, Inc. (the Company or Registrant) with executive offices at Nine Bond Street, Brooklyn, New York 11201, operates a number of commercial real estate properties, which are described in Item 2 Properties. The Companys business was founded in 1924 and incorporated under the laws of the State of New York on July 6, 1927.\nThe Company has 31 employees and has a contract, expiring November 30, 2022, with a union covering rates of pay, hours of employment and other conditions of employment for approximately 27% of its employees. The Company considers that its labor relations with its employees and union are good.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements which include assumptions about future market conditions, operations and financial results. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. They are made pursuant to safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The Companys actual results, performance or achievements in the future could differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements discussed or implied in such forward-looking statements herein and in prior U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings by the Company. The Company assumes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements or to advise of changes in the assumptions on which they were based.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, changes in the competitive environment of the Company, general economic and business conditions, industry trends, changes in government rules and regulations and environmental rules and regulations. Statements concerning interest rates and other financial instrument fair values and their estimated contribution to the Companys future results of operations are based upon market information as of a specific date. This market information is often a function of significant judgment and estimation. Further, market interest rates are subject to potential significant volatility. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Relating to Ownership Structure\nThe controlling shareholder group may be able to vote its shares in favor of its interests that may not always coincide with the interests of shareholders not part of such group. This risk may be counter-balanced to a degree by the actions of the Board of Directors whose composition is made up of a majority of independent directors.\nThe controlling shareholder group includes a corporation that owns a significant percentage of the Companys common stock and which does business with the Company, as further described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In theory, this could result in a conflict of interest; nevertheless, the Company and its largest shareholder have put in place some controls to reduce the effects of any perceived conflict of interest.\nCertain conflicts of interest may be perceived by the relationship between the Company and its largest shareholder. Both entities have the same Chief Executive Officer, and certain management personnel work for both entities. Nevertheless, the Companys Board of Directors (Board) is composed of a majority of independent directors. In 2005, in a case involving both entities, the Delaware Supreme Court in connection with an attempt to obtain books and records of the Company through a proceeding against the Companys significant shareholder, held that the actions of the Companys Board were proper.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on Our Results and Operations\nBeginning March 2020 and continuing through July 2022, we experienced an increase in late payments due to the impact of COVID-19 and the related reductions in economic activity from ongoing government mandated business regulations. The effects of COVID-19 on our tenants have been reflected in our allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable. In limited circumstances, we have agreed to rent deferrals for certain tenants. We also continue to experience volatility in the valuation of our equity investments through July 31, 2022.\nLooking ahead, the full impact of COVID-19 and continuing government regulation on our business is unknown and highly unpredictable. Our past results may not be indicative of our future performance and historical trends in revenues, income from operations, net income, earnings per share, cash provided by operating activities, among others, may differ materially. For example, to the extent the post pandemic effect continues to disrupt economic activity nationally and in New York, NY, like other businesses, it could adversely affect our business operations and financial results through prolonged decreases in revenue, credit deterioration of our tenants, depressed economic activity, or declines in capital markets. In addition, many of our expenses are less variable in nature and may not correlate to changes in revenues. The extent of the impact will depend on a number of factors, including the duration and severity of the pandemic; distribution of vaccines; and the macroeconomic impact of government measures to contain the spread of the virus and related government regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a part of the communities in which we do business. Accordingly, like other businesses in our communities, we are subject to the following risks:\n\u25cf the continued threat of terrorism;\n\u25cf economic downturns, both on a national and on local scales;\n\u25cf loss of key personnel;\n\u25cf the availability, if needed, of additional financing;\n\u25cf the continued availability of insurance (in different types of policies) at reasonably acceptable rates;\n\u25cf the general burdens of governmental regulation, at the Local, State and Federal levels;\n\u25cf climate change;\n\u25cf cyber security; and\n\u25cf pandemics and the ongoing effects of COVID-19.\nRisks Related to Real Estate Operations\nOur investment in property development may be limited by increasing costs required to fit up property to be leased to tenants. Also, as the cost of fitting up properties increases, we may be required to wait and forsake opportunities that would be revenue producing until such time that we obtain the necessary financing of such ventures. This risk may be mitigated by obtaining lines of credit and other financing vehicles, although such have significant limitations on the amounts that may be borrowed at any point in time.\nWe also may be subject to environmental liability as an owner or operator of properties. Many of our properties are old and when we need to fit up a property for a new tenant, we may find materials and the like that could be deemed to contain hazardous elements requiring remediation or encapsulation.\nThe impact of COVID-19 on demand for commercial real estate rental space has been significant. As online retail operations continued to expand nationwide during the pandemic, retailers are facing increased competition which reduces the need for the leasing of properties which is our business. Professionals working remotely during the pandemic has resulted in tenants careful evaluation of office space needs and a decline in demand of commercial office space rentals and increasing competition. The Company emphasizes retention of tenants over a long period of time which helps in difficult economic conditions. The Company also aggressively markets available space to tenants including governmental agencies, medical and educational institutions.\nWe try to lease our properties to tenants with adequate finances, but as a result of recent business downturns, even formerly financially strong tenants may be at risk. The Company mitigates risks of tenants with less than adequate finances by leasing our properties to multiple tenants where applicable in order to diversify the tenant base.\nRisks Related to our Investments\nExcess cash and cash equivalents may be invested from time to time. We seek to earn rates of return that will help us finance our business operations. These investments may be subject to significant uncertainties and may not be successful for many reasons, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf fluctuations in interest rates;\n\u25cf worsening of general economic and market conditions; and\n\u25cf adverse legal, financial and regulatory developments that may affect a particular business.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThese are some of the Risk Factors that could affect the Companys business. The Company endeavors to take actions and do business in a way that reduces these Risk Factors or, at least, takes them into account when conducting its business. Nevertheless, some of these Risk Factors cannot be avoided so that the Company must also take actions and do business that negates the adverse effects that these may have on the Company. ITEM 1B.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(A) EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nThe Companys management reviewed the Companys internal controls and procedures and the effectiveness of these controls. As of July 31, 2022, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision of, and with the participation of the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-14(c) and 15d-14(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company required to be included in its periodic SEC filings.\n(B) CHANGE TO INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nThere was no change in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting or in other factors during the Companys last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal controls over financial reporting. There were no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses noted, and therefore there were no corrective actions taken.\n(C) MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rule 13(a)-15(f). Our internal control system has been designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and its Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Even those systems that have been determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework published in 2013. Based on the Companys assessments, we believe that, as of July 31, 2022, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on these criteria.\nThis Form 10-K Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal controls over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to the permanent exemption for smaller reporting company filers from the internal control audit requirement of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
