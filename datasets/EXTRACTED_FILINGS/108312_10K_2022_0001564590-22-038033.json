We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Transportation. We also contract with similar government authorities outside the United States, subject in all cases to applicable law.\nWe must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. These laws and regulations, among other things:\nrequire accurate, complete and current disclosure and certification of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contracts;\nimpose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), and therefore require robust systems to reconcile;\nimpose regulations that define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. Government contracts;\nimpose manufacturing specifications and other quality standards that may be more restrictive than for non-government business activities; and\nrestrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes due to the regulations of the U.S. Government and foreign governments pertaining to the export of certain products and technical data.\nSales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, collectively represented 23% of our sales for fiscal year 2022 and 29% of our sales for fiscal year 2021.\nSeasonality\nWe believe our sales, in total or in either reportable segment, are not subject to significant seasonal variation. However, our sales have generally been lower in the first quarter of our fiscal year as compared to the immediately preceding quarter due to fewer working days resulting from the observance of various holidays and scheduled plant shutdowns for annual maintenance.\nSales Order Backlog\nFor each of our reportable segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligations. Our remaining performance obligations by segment, excluding material rights, as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 is shown in the table below.\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31, 2022 Percent Expected to be satisfied by September 30, 2023\nOctober 31,\nAerospace\n$\n1,198,571\n%\n$\n1,009,101\nIndustrial\n374,324\n261,074\n$\n1,572,895\n%\n$\n1,270,175\nOur remaining performance obligations relate to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue.\nManufacturing\nWe operate manufacturing and assembly plants primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia. Our products consist of mechanical, electronic and electromechanical systems and components.\nAluminum, iron and steel are primary raw materials used to produce our mechanical components. Other commodities, such as gold, copper and nickel, are also used in the manufacture of our products, although in much smaller quantities. We purchase various goods, including component parts and services used in production, logistics and product development processes from third parties. Generally, there are numerous sources for the raw materials and components used in our products, which we believe are sufficiently available to meet current requirements.\nWe maintain global strategic sourcing models to meet our global facilities' production needs while building long-term supplier relationships and efficiently managing our overall supply costs. We expect our suppliers to maintain adequate levels of quality raw materials and component parts, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support production of our various products. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to protect our intellectual property and processes and to monitor and mitigate risks of disruption in our supply base that could cause a business disruption to our production schedules or to our customers. The risks monitored include supplier financial viability, business continuity, quality, delivery and protection of our intellectual property and processes.\nOur customers expect us to maintain adequate levels of certain finished goods and certain component parts to support our warranty commitments and sales to our aftermarket customers, and to deliver such parts on a timely basis to support our customers standard and customary needs. We carry certain finished goods and component parts in inventory to meet these rapid delivery requirements of our customers.\nResearch and Development\nWe finance our research and development activities primarily with our own funds. Our research and development costs include basic research, applied research, component and systems development, and concept formulation studies.\nWe collaborate closely with our customers as they develop their technology plans, which leads to new product concepts. We believe this collaboration allows us to develop technology, new systems, and products that are aligned with our customers needs and future performance, which increases the likelihood that our systems and components will be selected for inclusion in the platforms developed by our customers. Further, we believe our close collaboration with our customers during preliminary design stages allows us to provide products that deliver the component and system\nperformance necessary to bring greater value to our customers. This preliminary work may include opportunities to test new products in order to validate concepts and demonstrate performance in challenging environments. We strive to stay ahead of the competition through our modeling, prototyping, and state of the art test capabilities.\nAerospace is focused on developing systems and components that we believe will be instrumental in helping our customers achieve their objectives of lower fuel consumption, lighter weight, more efficient performance, reduced emissions, and improved operating economics. We support our engine and airframe customers as they develop next generation designs across the commercial aviation, general aviation, civil private and military markets. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:\naerospace turbine engine applications, which include commercial, business and military turbofan engines of various thrust classes, turboshaft engines and turboprop engines;\nelectromechanical and hydraulic actuation systems for flight deck-to-flight surface control of fixed-wing aircraft and rotorcraft, and turbine engine nacelles, as well as guidance for weapon systems; and\nmotion control components for integration into comprehensive actuation systems.\nMost technology development programs begin years before an expected entry to service, such as those for the next generation of commercial aircraft. Other development programs result in nearer-term product launches associated with new OEM offerings, product upgrades, or product replacements on existing programs.\nWe developed the fuel system, air management system, and actuation hardware for CFM Internationals LEAP engine program. We also developed actuation system, combustion system and oil system components for Pratt & Whitneys Geared Turbo Fan (GTF or PurePower) engine program. We continue to support GE and CFM for improvements to the LEAP fuel system, and Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney for improvements to the PurePower engine programs.\nIndustrial is focused on developing innovative technologies, including integrated control systems and system components, that enable our customers to cost-effectively meet mandated emissions regulations and fuel efficiency demands, allow for usage of a wider range of fuel sources, increase reliability (particularly in harsh environments), and reduce total cost of ownership. Our development efforts support technology for a wide range of:\nproducts that improve the quality of combustion processes and provide more precise flow of various fuels and gases in our customers gas turbines and industrial reciprocating engines;\nelectronic devices and software solutions that provide improved control and protection of reciprocating engines, gas turbines, steam turbines, and engine- and turbine-powered equipment; and\nadvanced prognostic and predictive intelligence that is integrated into many of our complex products and systems.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees (whom we call members) are Woodwards most valuable resource for current and future success. We promote an environment that ensures safety, encourages diversity and inclusion, fosters growth and self-development, and provides meaningful work. All members participate in our success through attractive and aligned total rewards programs. Notable programs we offer to our full-time members include:\nemployer sponsored health insurance;\nemployer 401(k) matching contributions;\nannual Woodward stock contributions for U.S. members;\na tuition assistance program;\ntraining and professional development courses through our Woodward University curriculum; and\nother values-based and technical development training\nTenure of all employees averages nearly 11 years, reflective of our positive workplace culture. Our recruiting team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage and reward employee referrals for open positions.\nIn addition to our comprehensive investment in our members success, we strive to maintain an inclusive environment that values and leverages the uniqueness of each member to the benefit of all our stakeholders. We view the combination of diverse perspectives and backgrounds as a powerful force for innovation. To promote diversity and our core principles, we emphasize dignity, value, and equality of all members, regardless of race, color, religion, age, gender or sexual\norientation, through our actions and the workplace training programs we provide. We continually strive to harness the diversity of our global workforce by cultivating a climate that permits all our members to bring their authentic selves to work every day.\nThe health and safety of our members is also a top priority. We have implemented appropriate procedures and precautions to ensure the continued safety and well-being of members. We strive to comply with all federal and local workplace laws and regulations where we do business. We are always looking for ways to exceed compliance standards by utilizing continuous improvement discipline to proactively eliminate risks in the workplace.\nAs of October 31, 2022, we employed approximately 8,300 full-time members of which approximately 2,500 were located outside of the United States, with the majority of such members located in Germany, Poland and China.\nMember engagement drives better business results, and Woodward conducts biannual employee engagement surveys to give our members a voice in their work experience. In 2022, more than 68% of our members participated in our employee engagement surveys. These surveys help identify key engagement drivers at Woodward and areas where we have opportunity to improve. This has resulted in action plans at all levels of the organization and drives continuous conversations on the things that matter most to members and their teams.\nIn the United States, approximately 13% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2022. All union members in the United States work for our Aerospace segment. The collective bargaining agreements with our union members are generally renewed through contract renegotiation near the contract expiration dates. The MPC Employees Representative Union contract, which covered 710 members as of October 31, 2022, expires September 30, 2025. The Local Lodge 727-N International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers agreement, which covers 407 members as of October 31, 2022, expires April 23, 2024.\nIn Germany, approximately 12% of our total full-time workforce were union members as of October 31, 2022, all of whom work for our Industrial segment. Our Woodward LOrange members are part of the IG Metall union in Germany. IG Metall covered 961 members as of October 31, 2022.\nWe believe we have good, collaborative relationships with our union members and the representative unions.\nAlmost all of our other members in the United States were at-will members as of October 31, 2022, and therefore, not subject to any type of employment contract or agreement. Our executive officers each have severance and change-in-control agreements which have been filed with the SEC.\nOutside of the United States, we enter into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary, including coordination through local works councils. The provisions of these agreements correspond in each case with the required or customary terms in the subject jurisdiction.\nPatents, Intellectual Property, and Licensing\nWe own numerous patents and other intellectual property, and have licenses for the use of patents and other intellectual property owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. In addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. For example, the U.S. Government has certain rights in our patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of certain government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes as allowed by law.\nIntellectual property not covered by patents (or patent applications) includes trade secrets and other technological know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. Such unpatented technology, including research, development and engineering technical skills and know-how, as well as unpatented software, is important to our overall business and to the operations of each of our segments.\nWhile our intellectual property assets taken together are important, we do not believe our business or either of our segments would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $460,580 of net intangible assets. This value represents the carrying values, net of amortization, of certain assets acquired in various business acquisitions and does not purport to represent the fair value of our acquired intellectual property as of September 30, 2022.\nEnvironmental Matters and Climate Change\nThe Company is regulated by federal, state and international environmental laws governing our use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. Compliance with these existing laws has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or global competitive position.\nWe use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. We believe the risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. From time to time, we engage in environmental remediation activities, generally in coordination with other companies, pursuant to federal and state laws. In addition, we may be exposed to other environmental costs including participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. When it is reasonably probable that we will incur remediation costs at a site, and those costs can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for such future costs with a related charge against our earnings. In formulating that estimate and recognizing those costs, we do not consider amounts expected to be recovered from insurance companies, or others, until such recovery is assured. Currently, we have no sites undergoing remediation.\nOur manufacturing facilities generally do not produce volumes or quantities of byproducts, including greenhouse gases, that would be considered hazardous waste or otherwise harmful to the environment. We do not expect legislation currently pending or expected in the next several years to have a significant negative impact on our operations in any of our segments.\nDomestic and foreign legislative initiatives on emissions control, renewable energy, and climate change tend to favorably impact the sale of our energy control products. For example, our Industrial segment produces energy control products that help our customers maximize engine efficiency and minimize wasteful emissions, including greenhouse gases.\nAvailable Information\nThrough a link on the Investor Information section of our website, www.woodward.com, we make available, free of charge, the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed or furnished to the SEC: our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as Section 16 reports of our officers and directors.

Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nThe following summarizes important factors that could individually, or together with one or more other factors, affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows:\nCOVID-19 Pandemic Risks\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic (COVID-19) has led to significant volatility in virtually all product, service and economic markets, including financial markets, commodities (including oil and gas) and other industries (including the aviation industry), which has impacted our business, financial results and the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nGlobal health concerns pertaining to COVID-19 and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus and otherwise in response to the effects of the virus have impacted the economic environment, significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. The pandemic has also caused disruptions in global trade and labor markets. These have impacted global supply chain, which could impact the timeliness of shipments.\nCOVID-19 has adversely impacted, and will continue to adversely impact, our business, operations, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent of these impacts, particularly over time, depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, (i) the duration and magnitude of the pandemic, (ii) the actions taken to contain the virus or treat its impact, (iii) the impact of economic stimulus measures, and (iv) the extent to which economic and operating conditions and consumer and business spending return to their pre-pandemic levels.\nThe spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices and operations, including enhancing our operations management teams and global supply chain to ensure the Company is efficiently utilizing inventory on hand, as well as increasing our internal processing capabilities. Moreover, we expect that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will heighten many of the other risks described herein.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in highly competitive industries and, if we are unable to compete effectively in one or more of our markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition from a number of established competitors in the United States and abroad, some of which are larger in size or are divisions of large, diversified companies with substantially greater financial resources. In addition, global competition continues to increase. Changes in competitive conditions, including the availability of new technologies, products and services, the introduction of new channels of distribution, changes in OEM and aftermarket pricing, and further consolidation of companies in our industries, could impact our relationships with our customers and may adversely affect future sales and margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFurther, the markets in which we operate experience rapidly changing technologies and frequent introductions of new products and services. The technological expertise we have developed and maintained could become less valuable if a competitor were to develop a breakthrough technology that would allow it to match or exceed the performance of existing technologies at a lower cost. If we are unable to develop competitive technologies, future sales or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers, which makes our business more vulnerable to fluctuations in sales to these customers and changes in their financial condition.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers. We have fewer customers than many companies with similar sales volumes. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, sales to our largest 5 customers represented approximately 43% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 41% of our accounts receivable. If any of our significant customers were to change suppliers, in-source production, institute significant restructuring or cost-cutting measures, or experience financial distress, these significant customers may substantially reduce, or otherwise be unable to pay for, purchases from us. Accordingly, our consolidated net sales could decrease significantly, or we may experience difficulty collecting, or be unable to collect, amounts due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nIn October 2018 and March 2019, two commercial aircraft accidents led to the grounding by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and other regulators of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft, on which we have significant content. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX aircraft by the FAA and other regulators, which started in March of 2019 and continued through November 2020, caused deliveries of that aircraft to be zero in fiscal year 2020. As the aircraft return to service progresses, having been recertified in every jurisdiction except China, we anticipate a large majority of the deliveries missed in fiscal years 2019 through 2022 will be fulfilled in future periods, although at a slower rate than previously estimated. Although we anticipate a slow recovery of the OEM and a slightly better recovery of the initial provisioning sales as the aircrafts return to service progresses, the previous grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX could further decrease our OEM and initial provisioning sales for the 737 MAX and CFM LEAP engines in the near term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe long sales cycle, customer evaluation process, and implementation period of our products and services may increase the costs of obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of sales cycles and our inventory requirements.\nOur products and services are technologically complex and require significant capital commitments. Prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems. Accordingly, customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the products performance and compatibility. In addition, orders expected in one quarter may shift to another quarter or be cancelled with little advance notice as a result of customers budgetary constraints, internal acceptance reviews, and other factors affecting the timing of customers purchase decisions. The difficulty in forecasting demand increases the challenge in anticipating sales cycles and our inventory requirements, which may cause us to over-produce finished goods and could result in inventory write-offs, or could cause us to under-produce finished goods. Any such over-production or under-production could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur participation in a strategic joint venture with GE may make it more difficult to secure long-term sales in certain aerospace markets.\nIn January 2016, Woodward and GE, acting through its GE Aerospace business unit, consummated the formation of a strategic joint venture between Woodward and GE (the JV). The JV agreement does not restrict Woodward from entering into any market; however, consolidation in the aircraft engine market is increasingly prevalent, resulting in fewer engine manufacturers, and thus it may become more difficult for Woodward to secure new business with GE competitors on similar product applications both within and outside the specific JV market space. Additionally, if GE fails to win new content in the market space covered by the JV, Woodward may be prevented from expanding content on future commercial aircraft engines in those markets.\nGeneral Commercial, Financial, and Regulatory Risks\nSuppliers may be unable to provide us with materials of sufficient quality or quantity to meet our production needs at favorable prices or at all which may adversely affect our revenue and margins.\nWe are dependent upon suppliers for parts and raw materials used in the manufacture of products that we sell to our customers, and our raw material costs are subject to commodity market fluctuations and were impacted by the current inflationary environment. We have experienced shortages of certain parts and raw materials due to the ongoing supply chain disruptions. We may continue to experience shortages of parts or raw materials for the same or other reasons, such as the loss of a significant supplier, high overall demand creating shortages in parts and supplies we use, financial distress, work stoppages, natural disasters, fluctuations in commodity prices, the imposition of tariffs or other duties, or production or distribution difficulties that may affect one or more of our suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, or logistics support or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Some of our suppliers have experienced, and others may similarly experience, financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, and we have from time to time been, and may in the future be, unable to meet commitments to our customers and/or incur additional costs. Our customers rely on us to provide on-time delivery and have certain rights if our delivery standards are not maintained. A significant increase in our supply costs, including for raw materials that are subject to commodity price fluctuations, inflationary pressures, and/or the imposition of tariffs, or a protracted interruption of supplies for any reason, could result in the delay of one or more of our customer contracts, increase our costs, result in lost revenue or could damage our reputation and relationships with customers. In addition, quality and sourcing issues that our suppliers may experience can also adversely affect the quality and effectiveness of our products and services and may result in liability or reputational harm to us. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur profitability may suffer if we are unable to manage our expenses in connection with sales increases, sales decreases, or if we experience change in product mix.\nSome of our expenses are relatively fixed in relation to changes in sales volume and are difficult to adjust in the short term. Expenses driven by business activity other than sales level and other long-term expenditures, such as fixed manufacturing costs, capital expenditures and research and development expenses may be difficult to reduce in a timely manner in response to a reduction in sales. In periods of rapid sales increases it may be difficult to quickly increase our production of finished goods because of our long manufacturing lead times. If a sudden, unanticipated need for raw materials, components and labor arises, we could experience difficulties in sourcing these items at a favorable cost, in sufficient quantities or at all. These factors could result in delays in fulfilling customer sales contracts, lost revenue, damage to our reputation and relationships with our customers, and an inability to meet market demand, which in turn could prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities or responding to competitive pressures and could result in an increase in costs leading to a decrease in net earnings or even net losses. In addition, we sell products that have varying profit margins, and fluctuations in the mix of sales of our various products may affect our overall profitability.\nReductions, delays or changes in U.S. Government spending could adversely affect our business.\nSales made directly to U.S. Government agencies and entities, or indirectly through third party manufacturers, such as tier-one prime contractors, utilizing Woodward parts and subassemblies, accounted for approximately 23% of total sales in fiscal year 2022 and 29% in fiscal year 2021.\nThe U.S. Government participates in a wide variety of operations, including homeland defense, counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and other defense-related operations that employ our products and services. U.S. defense spending has historically been cyclical in nature and is subject to periodic congressional authorization and appropriation actions. The level of U.S. defense spending may be impacted by numerous factors outside of our control such as changes in the perceived threat environment, U.S. foreign policy, changes in security, defense, and intelligence priorities, shifts in domestic and international spending and tax policy, budget deficits and competing budget priorities, and the overall economic and political environment.\nDefense budgets tend to rise when perceived threats to national security increase the level of concern over the countrys safety, but we can provide no assurance that an increase in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Decreases in U.S. Government defense spending, changes in the spending allocation, phase-outs or terminations of certain aerospace and defense programs on which we have content could have a material adverse effect on our sales unless they are offset by other aerospace and defense programs and opportunities. If the priorities of\nthe U.S. Government change and/or defense spending is reduced, this may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business may be adversely affected by risks unique to government contracting.\nOur contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to certain unique risks, including the risks set forth below, some of which are beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of a failure by us or our customers to perform under the applicable contract. If any of our contracts are terminated by the U.S. Government, our backlog would be reduced, in accordance with contract terms, by the expected value of the remaining work under such contracts. In addition, we are not the prime contractor on most of our contracts for supply to the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, irrespective of the quality of our products and services as a subcontractor.\nWe must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of our U.S. Government contracts and the U.S. Government contracts of our customers. The U.S. Government may change procurement laws and regulations from time to time. A violation of U.S. Government procurement laws or regulations, a change in U.S. Government procurement laws and regulations, or a termination arising out of our default could expose us to liability, debarment, or suspension and could have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders.\nWe are subject to government inquiries, audits and investigations due to our business relationships with the U.S. Government and the heavily regulated industries in which we do business. In addition, our contract costs are subject to audits by the U.S. Government. U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Defense Contract Management Agency, routinely audit government contractors and subcontractors. These agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. Any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract would be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, would be refunded. Any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. Any inquiries or investigations, including those related to our contract pricing, could potentially result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, suspension, and/or debarment from participating in future business opportunities with the U.S. Government. Such actions could harm our reputation, even if such allegations are later determined to be unfounded, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur debt obligations and the restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt could limit our ability to operate our business or pursue our business strategies, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could significantly reduce stockholder benefits from a change of control event.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our total debt was $777,416, including $550,000 in unsecured notes denominated in U.S. dollars issued in private placements and $156,793 of unsecured notes denominated in Euros issued in private placements. We are obligated to make interest and scheduled principal payments under the agreements governing our long-term debt, which requires us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, and which may reduce the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including business development efforts and mergers and acquisitions. These debt obligations could make us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions and could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, thereby placing us at a disadvantage to our competitors that have less indebtedness. Further, we may require additional capital to repay our debt obligations when they mature, and such capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOur existing revolving credit facility and note purchase agreements impose financial covenants on us and our subsidiaries that require us to maintain certain leverage ratios and minimum levels of consolidated net worth. Certain of these agreements require us to repay outstanding borrowings with portions of the proceeds we receive from certain sales of property or assets and specified future debt offerings.\nThese financial covenants place certain restrictions on our business that may affect our ability to execute our business strategy successfully or take other actions that we believe would be in the best interests of our Company. These covenants include limitations or restrictions, among other things, on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\nincur additional indebtedness;\npay dividends or make distributions on our capital stock or certain other restricted payments or investments;\npurchase or redeem stock;\nissue stock of our subsidiaries;\nmake domestic and foreign investments and extend credit;\nengage in transactions with affiliates;\ntransfer and sell assets;\neffect a consolidation or merger or sell, transfer, lease, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\ncreate liens on our assets to secure debt.\nThese agreements contain certain customary events of default, including certain cross-default provisions related to other outstanding debt arrangements. Any breach of the covenants under these agreements or other event of default could cause a default under these agreements and/or a cross-default under our other debt arrangements, which could restrict our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility. If there were an event of default under certain provisions of our debt arrangements that was not cured or waived, the holders of the defaulted debt may be able to cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the debt instrument, plus any required settlement costs, to be due and payable immediately. Our assets and available cash balances may not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. If we are unable to repay, refinance, or restructure our indebtedness as required, or amend the covenants contained in these agreements, the lenders or note holders may be entitled to obtain a lien or institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAdditional tax expense or additional tax exposures could impact our future profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution mix of operating income among these different jurisdictions. Our tax expense includes estimates of additional tax that may be incurred and reflects various estimates, projections, and assumptions that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our future operating results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate, which could be caused by, among other things:\nchanges in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates;\nchanges in our overall profitability;\nchanges in rules or interpretations of existing tax laws;\nchanges in U.S. federal tax legislation and tax rates;\nchanges in state or non-U.S. government tax legislation and tax rates;\nchanges in tax incentives;\nchanges in U.S. GAAP;\nchanges in the projected realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities;\nchanges in managements assessment of the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore;\nchanges in managements intentions regarding the amount of earnings reinvested offshore; and\nthe results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.\nWe derive a significant amount of revenue and obtain components from outside of the United States; accordingly, we are subject to the risks inherent in doing business in other countries.\nIn fiscal year 2022, approximately 45% of our total sales were made to customers in jurisdictions outside of the United States (including products manufactured in the United States and sold outside the United States as well as products manufactured in international locations). We also purchase raw materials and components from suppliers outside the United States. Accordingly, our business and results of operations are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\ntransportation delays and interruptions;\npolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;\nacts of terrorism or war;\nthe imposition of taxes, import and export controls, duties and tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\nchanges in regulatory environments;\ncost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations governing various matters worldwide;\ncost of labor, labor shortages and other changes in labor conditions;\nthe potential for nationalization of enterprises;\npotential limitations on the Companys ability to enforce legal rights and remedies, including protection of intellectual property;\ndifficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems;\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including limitations on repatriations of earnings; and\ndifficulties in implementing restructuring actions on a timely basis.\nThe implementation of tariffs (such as those implemented by the United States and China in recent years) could increase the cost of certain commodities and/or limit their supply. Over the longer term, tariffs could significantly increase our costs and our ability to pass such increased costs along to our customers may be limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to and must comply with U.S. laws restricting or otherwise prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, including those on exports imposed under the U.S. Export Control Laws and Sanctions Programs. These laws and regulations change from time to time and may restrict sales to other countries or parties.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws and regulations in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing an improper business advantage. We operate in many parts of the world and sell to industries that have experienced corruption to some degree. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other similar anti-bribery law or regulatory violations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlso, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanges in the estimates of fair value of reporting units or of long-lived assets, particularly goodwill, may result in future impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.\nOver time, the fair values of long-lived assets change. At September 30, 2022, we had $772,559 of goodwill, representing 20% of our total assets. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Future goodwill impairment charges may occur if estimates of fair values decrease, which would reduce future earnings. Future asset impairment charges may occur if asset utilization declines, if customer demand decreases, or for a number of other reasons, which would reduce future earnings. Any such impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions of the fair value of our reporting units, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units will prove to be accurate projections of future performance, and any material error in our estimates and assumptions, could result in us needing to take a material impairment charge, which would have the effects discussed above.\nOur financial and operating performance depends on continued access to a stable workforce and on favorable labor relations with our employees.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, competition for technical personnel is intense and our future performance is highly dependent on our ability to hire, train, assimilate, and retain a qualified workforce. Additionally, it is important we hire and retain personnel with relevant experience in local laws, regulations, customs, traditions and business practices to support our international operations. Our ability to hire, train, assimilate and retain a qualified workforce has been impacted by the ongoing labor market disruptions. There is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in recruiting qualified employees in the future. Further, approximately 13% of our workforce in the United States is unionized, and certain of our operations in the United States and internationally involve different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils. We periodically need to renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements, and any failure to negotiate new agreements or extensions in a timely manner could result in work stoppages or slowdowns. Any significant increases in labor costs, deterioration of employee relations, including any conflicts with works councils or unions, or slowdowns or work stoppages at any of our locations, whether due to employee turnover, changes in availability of qualified technical personnel, failure to have a collaborative and effective relationship with our employees, including our union employees, or an effective collective bargaining agreement in place with our union employees, or otherwise, could impair our ability to supply products or fulfil orders, and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, our relationships with customers, and our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur operations and suppliers may be subject to physical and other risks that could disrupt our operations.\nOur operations and sources of supply could be disrupted by unforeseen events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather in countries in which we operate or in which our suppliers are located, any of which could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, public health concerns, war, political unrest, terrorist activity, equipment failures, power outages, or other unforeseen events could result in physical damage to or other disruption of, and complete or partial closure of, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, or could cause temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, disruption in the transport of our products and significant delays in the shipment of products and the provision of services, which could in turn cause the loss of sales and customers. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for all the costs that may arise from such events. Accordingly, disruption of our operations or the operations of a significant supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to protect all our products or technologies and we may, regardless of intent, infringe on the intellectual property rights of others.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents or rights to patents, protect trade secrets and know-how, and prevent others from infringing on our patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights. We cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us, that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by patents (or patent applications) and includes trade secrets and other know-how that is not patentable or for which we have elected not to seek patent protection, including intellectual property relating to our manufacturing processes and engineering designs. We will be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that it is covered by valid and enforceable patents, trademarks, licenses or other valid intellectual property rights. Patent protection generally involves complex legal and factual questions and, therefore, enforceability of patent rights cannot be predicted with certainty; thus, any patents that we own or license from others may not provide us with adequate protection against competitors. Moreover, the laws of certain foreign jurisdictions do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nAdditionally, our current or future technologies may, regardless of our intent, infringe upon the patents or violate other proprietary rights of third parties. In the event of such infringement or violation, we may face expensive litigation or indemnification obligations and may be prevented from selling existing products and pursuing product development or commercialization. If we are unable to sufficiently protect our patent and other proprietary rights or if we infringe on the patent or proprietary rights of others, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nAmounts accrued for contingencies may be inadequate to cover the amount of loss when the matters are ultimately resolved.\nWe are currently involved or may become involved in legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may include, without limitation, product liability matters, intellectual property matters, contract disputes or claims, pending or threatened litigation, governmental investigations, as well as employment, tax, environmental, or other matters. There is no certainty that the results of these matters will be favorable to the Company. We accrue for known individual matters if we believe it is probable that the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved using estimates of the most likely amount of loss. There may be additional losses that have not been accrued, or liabilities may exceed our estimates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by cybersecurity breaches or other information technology system or network interruptions or intrusions.\nWe depend heavily on information technology (IT) and computerized systems to communicate and operate effectively. We store sensitive data including proprietary business information, intellectual property, classified information, customer information, supplier information, and confidential employee or other personal data on our servers and databases. Also, due to political uncertainty and military actions associated with the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, we are vulnerable to heightened risks of cybersecurity incidents and security breaches initiated by nation-state or affiliated actors.\nFrom time to time, we have experienced cyberattacks on our IT infrastructure and systems. We may become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to our data or our customers data or to disrupt our operations or our ability to provide services. There is also a danger of loss, misuse, theft, unavailability, or unauthorized disclosure or other processing of information or assets (including source code), or damage to or other compromise of systems, components and other IT assets, including the introduction of malicious code or other vulnerabilities by people who obtain unauthorized access to our facilities, systems or information. There are many different techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to systems and data, and such techniques continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, and the adversaries are becoming more advanced, including nation states and actors sponsored by or affiliated with nation states, which target us and other defense contractors because we protect national security information, and other actors with substantial financial and technological resources. These techniques include, but are not limited to, the use of malicious software, destructive malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, phishing and other means of social engineering, and other means of causing system or network disruptions, obtaining unauthorized access to data or systems, or causing other cybersecurity breaches and incidents. Additionally, system and service disruptions, and cybersecurity breaches or incidents, may result from employee or contractor error, negligence, or malfeasance. Due to the rapidly evolving threat environment and other factors, we may not be successful in defending against all such attacks. Further, due to the evolving nature of these security threats and the national security aspects of much of the data we protect, the full impact of any future security breach or incident cannot be predicted. We employ a number of measures, including technical security controls, employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. However, our IT infrastructure, systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to numerous additional known or unknown threats. Additionally, there have been and may continue to be significant cyberattacks on, and other attempts to compromise the security of, the supply chain. We may experience security breaches or incidents resulting from tools, services, or other third-party components and security vulnerabilities within, or introduced by, such tools, services, or components.\nIf any of our IT infrastructure or systems are damaged, disrupted, or are impacted by security breaches or incidents, whether from cybersecurity attacks or other causes, or if we suffer any security breach or incident involving unauthorized access to, misuse, acquisition, disclosure, loss, alteration, or destruction of our data or other data we maintain or otherwise process, we could experience significant operational stoppages, disruptions, delays, and/or other detrimental impacts on our operations, and may face increased costs, including increased costs of implementing new data protection and security measures, policies, and procedures, and costs associated with remediating and otherwise responding to the security breach or incident. Any such security breach or incident or the perception that it has occurred, also may result in diminished competitive advantages through reputational damage and increased operational costs, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and orders, litigation or other demands, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, fines or penalties relating to actual or alleged violation of applicable laws, regulations, or contractual obligations, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships, and other costs and liabilities. Such events could result in fines, penalties, litigation or governmental investigations and proceedings, diminished competitive advantages through reputational damages and increased operational costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Further, any unauthorized disclosure or use or acquisition of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, result in a loss of intellectual property protection, and otherwise reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to compensate for all liability relating to any actual or potential disruption or other security breach or incident. We cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\nIncreasing emission standards that drive certain product sales may be eased or delayed, which could reduce our competitive advantage.\nWe sell components and systems that have been designed to meet strict emission standards, including standards that have not yet been implemented but are expected to be implemented soon. If these emission standards are eased, developed products may become unnecessary and/or our future sales could be lower as potential customers select alternative products or delay adoption of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nPrices for fossil fuels may increase significantly and disproportionately to other sources of fuels used for power generation, which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nCommercial producers of electricity use many of our components and systems, most predominately in their power plants that use natural gas as their fuel source. Commercial producers of electricity are often in a position to manage the use of different power plant facilities and make decisions based on operating costs. Compared to other sources of fuels used for power generation, natural gas prices have increased slower than fuel oil, but about the same as coal. This increase in natural gas prices and any future increases, whether in absolute dollars or relative to other fuel costs such as oil, could impact the sales mix of our components and systems, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nLong-term reduced commodity prices for oil, natural gas, and other minerals may depress the markets for certain of our products and services, particularly those from our Industrial segment.\nMany of our Industrial segment OEM and aftermarket customers and our Aerospace segment rotorcraft product lines customers provide goods and services that support various industrial extraction activities, including mining, oil and gas exploration and extraction, and transportation of raw materials from extraction sites to refineries and/or processing facilities. Long-term lower prices for commodities such as oil, natural gas, gold, tin, and various other minerals could reduce exploration activities and place downward pressure on demand for our goods and services that support exploration and extraction activities.\nBusiness Risks\nOur product development activities may not be successful, may be more costly than currently anticipated, or we may not be able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure.\nOur business involves a significant level of product development activities, generally in connection with our customers development activities. Industry standards, customer expectations, or other products may emerge that could render one or more of our products or services less desirable or obsolete. Additionally, our competitors may develop new technology, or more efficient ways to produce their existing products that could cause our existing products or services to become less desirable or obsolete. Maintaining our market position requires continued investment in research and development. During an economic downturn or a subsequent recovery, we may need to maintain our investment in research and development, which may limit our ability to reduce these expenses in proportion to a sales shortfall.\nIn addition, increased investments in research and development may divert resources from other potential investments in our business, such as acquisitions or investments in our facilities, processes and operations. If these activities are not as successful as currently anticipated, are not completed on a timely basis, or are more costly than currently anticipated, or if we are not able to produce newly developed products at a cost that meets the anticipated product cost structure, then our future sales, margins and/or earnings could be lower than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nProduct liability claims, product recalls or other liabilities associated with the products and services we provide may force us to pay substantial damage awards and other expenses that could exceed our accruals and insurance coverage.\nThe manufacture and sale of our products and the services we provide expose us to risks of product and other tort claims, and any resulting liability. We currently have and have had in the past product liability claims relating to our products, and we will likely be subject to additional product liability claims in the future for past, current and future products. Some of these claims may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We also provide certain services to our customers and are subject to claims with respect to the services provided. In providing such services, we may rely on subcontractors to perform all or a portion of the contracted services. It is possible that we could be liable to our customers for work performed by a subcontractor.\nRegardless of the outcome, product liability claims can be expensive to defend, can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, and can cause reputational damage. While we believe that we have appropriate insurance coverage available to us related to any such claims, our insurance may not cover all liabilities or be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. An unsuccessful result in connection with a product liability claim, where the liabilities are not covered by insurance or for which indemnification or other recovery is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have pursued, and expect to pursue acquisitions of other companies and assets. The success of these transactions depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate these businesses into our operations and realize the planned synergies. Integration of acquired operations may take longer, or be more costly or disruptive to our business, than originally anticipated. The integration of these acquisitions may require significant attention from our management, and the diversion of managements attention and resources could have a material adverse effect on our ability to manage our business. We may also incur costs and divert management attention to acquisitions that are never consummated.\nDifficulties in the integration of the acquired business may include consolidating the operations, processes and systems of the acquired business, retaining and motivating key management and employees, and integrating existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Even if integration is successful, the financial and operational results may differ materially from our assumptions and forecasts due to unforeseen expenses, delays, conditions and liabilities. Evolving regulations such as changes in tax, trade, environmental, labor, safety, payroll or pension policies could increase the expected costs of acquisitions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the agreed upon purchase price. In addition, we may incur unanticipated costs or expenses following an acquisition, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, and other liabilities.\nMany of these factors are outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues, and diversion of managements time and attention. Failure to successfully implement our acquisition strategy, including successfully integrating acquired businesses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe also may make strategic divestitures from time to time, such as the divestiture of our renewable power systems business and related businesses. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. Nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur restructuring activities may increase our expenses and reduce our profitability, and may not have the intended effects.\nFrom time to time, we have implemented restructuring and other actions designed to reduce structural costs, improve operational efficiency and position the Company for long-term profitable growth. Historically, our restructuring activities have included workforce management and other restructuring charges related to acquired businesses. Due to cost reduction measures or changes in the industries and markets in which we compete, we may decide to implement restructuring or alignment activities in the future, such as closing plants, moving production lines, or making additions, reductions or other changes to our management or workforce. These restructuring and/or alignment activities generally result in charges and expenditures that may adversely affect our financial results for one or more periods.\nRestructuring and/or alignment activities can also create unanticipated consequences, such as instability or distraction among our workforce, and we cannot be sure that any restructuring or alignment efforts that we undertake will be successful. A variety of risks could cause us not to realize expected cost savings, including, among others, higher than expected severance costs related to staff reductions, higher than expected costs of closing plants, higher costs to hire new employees or delays or difficulty hiring the employees needed, higher than expected operating costs associated with moving production lines, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our cost-saving plan, and other unexpected costs associated with operating the business.\nIf we are unable to structure our operations in the light of evolving market conditions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur manufacturing activities may result in future environmental costs or liabilities.\nWe use hazardous materials and/or regulated materials in our manufacturing operations. We also own, operate, have acquired, and may in the future acquire facilities that were formerly owned and operated by others that used such materials. The risk that a significant release of regulated materials has occurred in the past or will occur in the future cannot be completely eliminated or prevented. As a result, we are subject to a substantial number of costly regulations and we must conform our operations to applicable regulatory requirements in all countries in which we operate. To the best of our knowledge, we have been and will be at all times, in complete compliance with all environmental requirements, or that we will not incur additional material costs or liabilities in connection with these requirements.\nIn addition, we may be subject to other environmental remediation costs such as participation in superfund sites or other similar jurisdictional initiatives. As a result, we may incur material costs or liabilities or be required to undertake future environmental remediation activities that could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure of our production lines, or those of our subcontractors, to meet required certification standards could disrupt production.\nOur existing production lines, as well as the production lines of our subcontractors, are sometimes required to pass varying levels of qualification with certain of our customers. Some of our customers require that our production lines pass their specific qualification standards and that we, and any subcontractors that we may use, be registered under or certified to certain U.S. or international quality standards. We may be unable to obtain, maintain, or we may experience delays in obtaining, a certification or registration to a required quality standard. A delay in obtaining, or the failure to obtain a necessary quality certification or registration could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Dollar and number of share amounts contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are in thousands, except per share amounts.\nGlobal Business Conditions\nWe continue to monitor a variety of external issues impacting our business, including ongoing global supply chain and labor disruptions, rising labor and material inflation, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates which together have led to a challenging industry-wide operating environment.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we continued to see recovery across our end markets with the exception of China. Our financial performance was adversely impacted by ongoing global supply chain and labor disruptions, rising labor and material inflation, and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. We are actively implementing strategies to mitigate our supply chain risk to better position us for future success. We also continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs; however, the timing of many price increases can be delayed due to certain pre-existing contractual arrangements. We remain focused on operational excellence initiatives, talent development and innovation to help drive the company forward and create value for our shareholders. We are unable to predict the full extent to which these issues will continue to adversely impact our business, including our operational performance, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Such uncertainty may affect our ability to accurately predict our future performance and financial results.\nWe continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions to alter our business operations if we determine such actions are in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, customers, communities, business partners, and suppliers. It is not currently clear what the potential effects of any such alterations or modifications may have on our business in future periods, including the effects on our customers, employees and prospects, or on our financial results.\nThe Russia-Ukraine Conflict\nIn February 2022, in response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) members, and certain non-member countries announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia and Russian enterprises. The continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions enacted by the United States, other NATO member states, and other countries. Sales to Russia were less than 1% of our total sales during fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. While the impact of any additional bans, sanction\nprograms, and boycotts is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the military conflict as it continues to unfold, the impacts of the conflict have included and could continue to include supply chain and logistics disruptions, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy, heightened cybersecurity threats, and other potential impacts.\nPM Control Acquisition\nOn August 2, 2022, we entered into a series of Purchase Agreements with one of our Asia pacific channel partners, PM Control PLC (the PM Agreements). Pursuant to the PM Agreements, we agreed to acquire business assets and shares of stock of PM Control PLC and its affiliates (collectively PM Control), for a total consideration (excluding cash acquired from the acquisition and including the settlement of pre-existing relationships) of $22,299 (the PM Acquisition). The PM Acquisition closed on the end of business day August 31, 2022 (the PM Closing) and PM Control became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nFinancial information for PM Control is reflected in our financial statements from the date of the PM Closing. The comparison of results for fiscal year 2022 to fiscal years 2021 and 2020 will not be affected, as the amounts included in our financial statements for fiscal year 2022 are immaterial.\nBUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS\nWe serve the aerospace and industrial markets.\nAerospace Markets\nOur aerospace products and systems are primarily used to provide propulsion, actuation and motion control in both commercial and defense fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft, guided weapons, and other defense systems.\nCommercial and Civil Aircraft - In the commercial aerospace markets, global air traffic continued to recover and grow in fiscal year 2022, though it remains below the historically high levels of pre-pandemic years. Commercial aircraft production has slowly increased, as aircraft OEMs continued to ramp from post-COVID production levels. We expect commercial aircraft production to continue to increase and to exceed pre-COVID production levels in the coming years. Aircraft operators are taking delivery of next generation aircraft models to meet the growing demand for passenger air travel, the need to replace aging aircraft, and the demand for more fuel efficient and lower emission aircraft. The trend toward the newer generation of aircraft that have recently entered service or are scheduled to go into production over the next several years favors our product offerings because we have more content on those aircraft. We expect production levels to continue to grow due to solid OEM order backlogs for the new aircraft models and pent-up demand. Demand in the business and general aviation market improved in fiscal year 2022 as business jet deliveries were up because of the introduction of some new models, reduced availability of used aircraft, and improving corporate profitability. Turboprop and helicopter deliveries also improved in fiscal year 2022 in part due to increasing oil prices and overall financial market improvements. We expect business jet, turboprop and helicopter deliveries to further improve in fiscal year 2023 as aircraft operations continue to recover.\nWe have content on the Airbus A220, A320neo, and A330neo, Bell 429, Boeing 737 MAX, 777, 787, and 747-8. We have been awarded content on the 777-9, the Comac C919, and a variety of business jet platforms, among others. We continue to explore opportunities on new engine and aircraft programs that are under consideration or have been recently announced.\nThe Boeing 737 MAX has returned to service in every jurisdiction except China. As the aircrafts return to service progresses, we anticipate a large majority of the deliveries missed in fiscal year 2019 through 2022 will be fulfilled in future periods, although at a slower rate than previously estimated. The continuing return to service of the 737 MAX aircraft in many jurisdictions contributed to positive impacts on OEM sales, and initial provisioning sales related to the 737 MAX aircraft and CFM LEAP engine have begun to come through. We anticipate further recovery of OEM 737 MAX sales in fiscal year 2023.\nDefense - In recent years, the defense industry has been strong as budgetary allocations have generally increased since 2016. The conflict in Ukraine and its influence on European defense postures are pressuring global defense budgets upward. The U.S. National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022 resulted in higher levels of funding for both procurement and research and development, and we believe budget increases in recent years will support growth in fiscal year 2023, with the exception of our guided tactical weapons programs. Our involvement with a wide variety of defense programs in fixed-wing aircraft, rotorcraft and weapons systems has provided relative stability for our defense market sales, as some newer programs increase (e.g., Lightning II, KC-46A Tanker, and T-7A Trainer), some legacy programs are\ndecreased (e.g., F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet and V-22 Osprey). Other programs are relatively steady (e.g., UH-60 Black Hawk and A-64 Apache helicopter programs) and some legacy programs, such as the, will maintain or potentially increase production. Weapons programs for which we have significant sales include the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM), Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) and AIM-9X guided tactical weapon systems. We expect overall production rates to decrease for some of these weapons programs due to anticipated decline in demand, compared to the very strong production rates in recent years.\nAftermarket - Our commercial aftermarket business has increased in fiscal year 2022, as global air traffic continued to recover and grow from its pandemic lows in fiscal year 2020, and because our products have been selected for new aerospace platforms and our content has increased across existing platforms. With the entry into service of the new single aisle aircraft (Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus A320neo), we have seen a significant increase in initial provisioning sales to the operators of these new aircraft. As new aircraft production levels increase to accommodate rising passenger demand and to mitigate higher operating costs driven largely by higher fuel costs on older and less fuel-efficient aircraft, we expect airlines will retire older generation aircraft as they reach certain age thresholds (typically around twenty-five years on average). However, in the past few years, aircraft retirements have decreased because passenger demand has outpaced deliveries of next generation aircraft, forcing older generation legacy aircraft to remain in service longer than anticipated. This has led to increased demand-for repairs and spare parts for older engine programs remaining in service-consistent with air traffic recovery from the post-COVID-19 low levels. This dynamic applies to commercial aftermarket related to repairs and spare parts for mature legacy programs with large in-service fleets, such as the Airbus A320 and the Boeing 777.\nOur defense aftermarket was down during fiscal year 2022 due to global supply chain and labor disruptions. Global conflicts and growing international demand for various other military programs continue to drive demand for operations of defense aircraft, including fighter jets, transports and both utility and attack rotorcraft, which are all supported by our products and systems. Although we expect variability, which is generally attributable to the cycling of various maintenance and upgrade programs, as well as actual usage, our outlook for the defense aftermarket is strong. This is due primarily to growing fleets, the service lives of existing military programs being extended and increased demand for repairs and spare parts for older military aircraft programs remaining in service.\nSpace - Many new space launches and mission equipment opportunities are being driven by commercial space launch and satellite providers, who are rapidly increasing their investment and participation in these markets.\nIndustrial Markets\nOur industrial products are used worldwide in various types of turbine and reciprocating engine-powered equipment, including electric power generation and distribution systems, ships, locomotives, compressors, pumps, and other mobile and industrial machines.\nIndustrial Turbines - The demand for industrial gas turbines for power generation, which consists mainly of heavy frames, aero derivatives, and steam, increased in fiscal year 2022 due to increased new unit build rates and high utilization of the in-service fleet driving the current and future marine aftermarket activity, and strong demand for power generation and process industries, particularly in Asia. Start reliability, fuel flexibility, safety, and part-load efficiency are all key drivers of the turbine market as the conversion from coal to natural gas usage continues, and we believe Woodward continues to be well positioned to meet these market needs on the existing and next generation turbines. We project continued growth as demand for electricity is met through a balance of renewable power sources and newer industrial gas turbines for which Woodward has been awarded increased content.\nReciprocating Engines - Woodwards key markets for industrial engine control technologies and fuel system equipment are power generation, transportation (including compressed natural gas and liquified natural gas trucks in Asia, mining, and marine shipping), and oil and gas. Due to higher gas prices and global supply chain and labor disruptions, powerplant operations have transitioned to higher liquid fuel use, thereby increasing the demand for our products. The demand from internet traffic and data storage is driving demand for data center power generation. While demand growth for reciprocating engines in fiscal year 2022 was supported by aftermarket demand and investment into new highspeed equipment, we anticipate strong demand in fiscal year 2023 for new highspeed engines and new marine engines. We expect market share gains by our customers and increased scope on the next generation reciprocating engines as energy policies in some countries encourage the use of compressed natural gas, liquefied natural gas, and other alternative fuels over carbon-rich petroleum fuels, which we expect will drive increased demand for our alternative fuel clean engine control technologies.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Highlights\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet sales:\nAerospace segment\n$\n1,519,322\n$\n1,404,117\nIndustrial segment\n863,468\n841,715\nConsolidated net sales\n$\n2,382,790\n$\n2,245,832\nEarnings:\nAerospace segment\n$\n230,933\n$\n234,356\nSegment earnings as a percent of segment net sales\n15.2\n%\n16.7\n%\nIndustrial segment\n$\n82,788\n$\n108,672\nSegment earnings as a percent of segment net sales\n9.6\n%\n12.9\n%\nConsolidated net earnings\n$\n171,698\n$\n208,649\nAdjusted net earnings\n$\n173,823\n$\n212,385\nEffective tax rate\n14.1\n%\n15.1\n%\nAdjusted effective tax rate\n14.3\n%\n15.3\n%\nConsolidated diluted earnings per share\n$\n2.71\n$\n3.18\nConsolidated adjusted diluted earnings per share\n$\n2.75\n$\n3.24\nEarnings before interest and taxes (\"EBIT\")\n$\n232,629\n$\n278,586\nAdjusted EBIT\n$\n235,463\n$\n283,594\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (\"EBITDA\")\n$\n353,257\n$\n408,110\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n356,091\n$\n413,118\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.

The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to production delays from global supply chain disruptions as well as increases in working capital (excluding cash) to support the growth we anticipate in the next fiscal year.\nFor fiscal year 2022, free cash flow, which we define as net cash flows from operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment, was $140,770, compared to $426,980 for fiscal year 2021. Adjusted free cash flow, which we define as free cash flow, plus the payments for costs related to business development activities and restructuring activities, was $144,257. No adjustments were made to free cash flow for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in free cash flow for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to production delays from supply chain disruptions as well as increases in working capital (excluding cash) to support the growth we anticipate in the next fiscal year, higher payments for property, plant and equipment and lower earnings. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow are non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.

At September 30, 2022, we also had additional borrowing capacity of $27,266 under various foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities.\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings and Other Selected Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth consolidated statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales for each period indicated:\nYear Ended September 30,\n% of Net Sales\n% of Net Sales\nNet sales\n$\n2,382,790\n%\n$\n2,245,832\n%\nCosts and expenses:\nCost of goods sold\n1,857,485\n78.0\n1,694,774\n75.5\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses\n203,005\n8.5\n186,866\n8.3\nResearch and development costs\n119,782\n5.0\n117,091\n5.2\nRestructuring charges\n(3,420\n)\n(0.1\n)\n5,008\n0.2\nInterest expense\n34,545\n1.4\n34,282\n1.5\nInterest income\n(1,814\n)\n(0.1\n)\n(1,495\n)\n(0.1\n)\nOther expense (income), net\n(26,691\n)\n(1.1\n)\n(36,493\n)\n(1.6\n)\nTotal costs and expenses\n2,182,892\n91.6\n2,000,033\n89.1\nEarnings before income taxes\n199,898\n8.4\n245,799\n10.9\nIncome tax expense\n28,200\n1.2\n37,150\n1.7\nNet earnings\n$\n171,698\n7.2\n$\n208,649\n9.3\nOther select financial data:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nWorking capital\n$\n772,856\n$\n1,098,466\nTotal debt\n777,416\n734,122\nTotal stockholders' equity\n1,901,122\n2,214,781\n2022 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n2022 Net Sales Compared to 2021\nConsolidated net sales for fiscal year 2022 increased by $136,958, or 6.1%, compared to fiscal year 2021.\nDetails of the changes in consolidated net sales are as follows:\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2021\n$\n2,245,832\nAerospace volume\n65,302\nIndustrial volume\n64,007\nNoncash consideration\n(5,816\n)\nEffects of changes in price and sales mix\n67,683\nEffects of changes in foreign currency rates\n(54,218\n)\nConsolidated net sales for the year ended September 30, 2022\n$\n2,382,790\nThe increase in consolidated net sales for fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to an increase in Aerospace sales volume, the impact of price increases, as well as increases in Industrial volume, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts.\nIn the Aerospace segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily attributable to a significant increase in commercial OEM and aftermarket sales driven by higher OEM aircraft production rates and increasing aircraft utilization, partially offset by lower defense aftermarket sales primarily driven by global supply chain and labor disruptions. As of September 30, 2022, Aerospace segment net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million due to ongoing global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nIn the Industrial segment, the increase in net sales for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily attributable to higher industrial turbomachinery sales supporting increasing demand for power generation and process industries as well as higher marine sales driven by increased utilization of the in-service fleet, partially offset by weakness in natural gas engines in China and by unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Industrial segment net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $45 million due to ongoing global supply chain and labor disruptions.\n2022 Costs and Expenses Compared to 2021\nCost of goods sold increased by $162,711 to $1,857,485, or 78.0% of net sales, for fiscal year 2022, from $1,694,774, or 75.5% of net sales, for fiscal year 2021. The increase in cost of goods sold in fiscal year 2022, as compared to the same period of the prior year is primarily attributable to net inflationary impacts on material and labor costs, as well as increases in manufacturing costs related to global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nGross margin (as measured by net sales less cost of goods sold, divided by net sales) was 22.0% for fiscal year 2022, compared to 24.5% for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to net inflationary impacts on material and labor costs, increases in manufacturing costs related to global supply chain disruptions and inefficiencies related to training new members.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $16,139, or 8.6%, to $203,005 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $186,866 for fiscal year 2021. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 8.5% for fiscal year 2022, compared to 8.3% for fiscal year 2021. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales, for fiscal year 2022 compared to the prior year is primarily due to the incurrence of a certain expense in fiscal year 2022 in connection with a non-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, as well as certain business development activities, which in each case did not occur in the prior fiscal year period.\nResearch and development costs increased by $2,691, or 2.3%, to $119,782 for fiscal year 2022, as compared to $117,091 for fiscal year 2021. Research and development costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to 5.0% for fiscal year 2022, as compared to 5.2% for fiscal year 2021. The increase in research and development costs in dollars for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to variability in the timing of projects and expenses. The decrease in research and development costs as a percentage of net sales for fiscal year 2022 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to net sales increases in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021. Our research and development activities extend across almost all of our customer base, and we anticipate ongoing variability in research and development due to the timing of customer business needs on current and future programs.\nRestructuring activities decreased by $8,428, to a benefit of $3,420 for fiscal year 2022, compared to charges of $5,008 for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in restructuring activities is primarily attributable to a new organizational structure and leadership change approved during fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, due to changes in business conditions including plans to insource work from suppliers and to manage workforce levels through attrition, the remaining unpaid accrued amount of $4,503 is no longer needed and therefore reversed.\nInterest expense increased by $263, or 0.8%, to $34,545, for fiscal year 2022, compared to $34,282 for fiscal year 2021. Interest expense decreased as a percentage of net sales at 1.4% for fiscal year 2022, as compared to 1.5% for fiscal year 2021. Interest expense increased for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to increased borrowings on our revolving credit agreement, partially offset by reduced long-term debt balances. In fiscal year 2021, we paid the entire balance of two series of private placement notes totaling $100,000, primarily using cash from operations and borrowings from our revolving credit facility. In fiscal year 2022, we had outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility whereas in fiscal year 2021 we had no borrowings.\nOther income, net was $26,691 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $36,493 for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in other income in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to a loss on investments in our deferred compensation program, whereas a gain on investments was recognized in the prior fiscal year.\nIncome taxes were provided at an effective rate on earnings before income taxes of 14.1% for fiscal year 2022, compared to 15.1% for fiscal year 2021.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to a partial release of valuation allowance related to state credits and increased Research and Development Credit in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was partially offset by a reduced stock-based compensation tax benefit in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nSegment Results\nThe following table presents sales by segment:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet sales:\nAerospace\n$\n1,519,322\n63.8%\n$\n1,404,117\n62.5%\nIndustrial\n863,468\n36.2%\n841,715\n37.5%\nConsolidated net sales\n$\n2,382,790\n100%\n$\n2,245,832\n100%\nThe following table presents earnings by segment and reconciles segment earnings to consolidated net earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAerospace\n$\n230,933\n$\n234,356\nIndustrial\n82,788\n108,672\nNonsegment expenses\n(81,092\n)\n(64,442\n)\nInterest expense, net\n(32,731\n)\n(32,787\n)\nConsolidated earnings before income taxes\n199,898\n245,799\nIncome tax expense\n28,200\n37,150\nConsolidated net earnings\n$\n171,698\n$\n208,649\nThe following table presents segment earnings as a percent of segment net sales:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAerospace\n15.2%\n16.7%\nIndustrial\n9.6%\n12.9%\n2022 Segment Results Compared to 2021\nAerospace\nAerospace segment net sales increased by $115,205, or 8.2% to $1,519,322 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $1,404,117 for fiscal year 2021. Segment net sales increased for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 primarily due to significantly higher commercial OEM and aftermarket sales due to higher OEM aircraft production rates, continued recovery in passenger traffic, and increasing aircraft utilization. The increase in aerospace segment sales was partially offset by lower defense OEM and aftermarket sales, driven primarily by lower sales for guided weapons and global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Aerospace segment net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $40 million due to global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nAerospace segment earnings decreased by $3,423, or 1.5%, to $230,933 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $234,356 for fiscal year 2021.\nThe net decrease in Aerospace segment earnings for fiscal year 2022 was due to the following:\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2021\n$\n234,356\nSales volume\n36,867\nPrice, sales mix and productivity\n(17,491\n)\nManufacturing costs related to hiring and training\n(20,772\n)\nAnnual variable incentive compensation costs\n(6,809\n)\nOther, net\n4,782\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2022\n$\n230,933\nThe decrease in Aerospace segment earnings for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to net inflationary impacts, as well as increases in manufacturing costs related to global supply chain disruptions and inefficiencies related to hiring and training, partially offset by higher commercial OEM and aftermarket sales volume. Aerospace segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 15.2% for fiscal year 2022 and 16.7% for fiscal year 2021.\nIndustrial\nIndustrial segment net sales increased by $21,753, or 2.6%, to $863,468 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $841,715 for fiscal year 2021. Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative impact on segment net sales of $50,767 for fiscal year 2022.\nThe increase in Industrial segment net sales in fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily attributable to increased industrial turbomachinery sales supporting increasing demand for power generation and process industries as well as higher marine sales driven by increased utilization of the in-service fleet, partially offset by lower sales of natural gas-powered engines in China and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.\nAs of September 30, 2022, Industrial segment net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $45 million due to global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nIndustrial segment earnings decreased by $25,884, or 23.8%, to $82,788 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $108,672 for fiscal year 2021.\nThe net decrease in Industrial segment earnings for fiscal year 2022 was due to the following:\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2021\n$\n108,672\nSales volume\n29,229\nPrice, sales mix and productivity\n(24,222\n)\nManufacturing costs related to hiring and training\n(19,400\n)\nEffects of changes in foreign currency rates\n(8,809\n)\nAnnual variable incentive compensation costs\n(3,762\n)\nOther, net\n1,080\nEarnings for the period ended September 30, 2022\n$\n82,788\nThe decrease in Industrial segment earnings for fiscal year 2022 as compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to net inflationary impacts, increases in manufacturing costs related to global supply chain disruptions and inefficiencies related to hiring and training, as well as unfavorable foreign currency impacts. Industrial segment earnings as a percentage of segment net sales were 9.6% for fiscal year 2022, compared to 12.9% for fiscal year 2021.\nNonsegment\nNonsegment expenses increased to $81,092 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $64,442 for fiscal year 2021. The increase in nonsegment expenses for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was primarily a result of a non-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business and certain business development activities, neither of which occurred in fiscal year 2021, as well as the timing of certain expenses and the return of annual variable incentive compensation costs.\nFor a discussion of the 2021 Results of Operations, including a discussion of the financial results for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, refer to Part I, Item 7 of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on November 19, 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, we have satisfied our working capital needs, as well as capital expenditures, product development and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations, with cash flow provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facilities. We have also issued debt to supplement our cash needs, repay our other indebtedness, or finance our acquisitions. We expect that cash generated from our operating activities, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility and other borrowing capacity, will be sufficient to fund our continuing operating needs for the next 12 months and the foreseeable future.\nOur aggregate cash and cash equivalents were $107,844 at September 30, 2022 and $448,462 at September 30, 2021, and our working capital was $772,856 at September 30, 2022 and $1,098,466 at September 30, 2021. Of the cash and cash equivalents held at September 30, 2022, $87,639 was held by our foreign locations. We are not presently aware of any significant restrictions on the repatriation of these funds, although a portion is considered indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the United States, then they could be repatriated and their repatriation into the United States may cause us to incur additional U.S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes. Any additional U.S. taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is impractical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these funds were to be repatriated.\nOur revolving credit facility, as amended, provides a borrowing capacity of up to $1,000,000 with the option to increase total available borrowings to up to $1,500,000, subject to lenders participation. We can borrow against our revolving credit facility as long as we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility can be made in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar provided that the U.S. dollar equivalent of any foreign currency borrowings and U.S. dollar borrowings does not, in total, exceed the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility. Historically, we have used borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to meet certain short-term working capital needs, as well as for strategic uses, including repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends, acquisitions, and facility expansions.\nIn addition to our revolving credit facility, we have various foreign credit facilities, some of which are tied to net amounts on deposit at certain foreign financial institutions. These foreign credit facilities are reviewed annually for renewal. We use borrowings under these foreign credit facilities to finance certain local operations on a periodic basis. For further discussion of our revolving credit facility and our other credit facilities, see Note 15, Credit facilities, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had total outstanding debt of $777,416 consisting of various series of unsecured notes due between 2023 and 2033, and amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility, and our finance leases. On November 15, 2020, we paid the entire principal balance of $100,000 on our Series G and J Notes using primarily free cash flow and proceeds from borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility. At September 30, 2022, we had additional borrowing availability of $923,506 under our revolving credit facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, and additional borrowing availability of $27,266 under various foreign credit facilities.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $66,800 outstanding on our revolving credit facility, all of which is classified as short-term borrowings based on our intent and ability to pay this amount in the next twelve months. Revolving credit facility and short-term borrowing activity during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nMaximum daily balance during the period\n$\n264,500\nAverage daily balance during the period\n$\n86,795\nWeighted average interest rate on average daily balance\n2.88\n%\nWe believe we were in compliance with all our debt covenants as of September 30, 2022. See Note 15, Credit facilities, short-term borrowings and long-term debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplemental Data, for more information about our covenants.\nIn addition to utilizing our cash resources to fund the working capital needs of our business, we evaluate additional strategic uses of our funds, including the repurchase of our common stock, payment of dividends, significant capital expenditures, consideration of strategic acquisitions and other potential uses of cash.\nOur ability to service our long-term debt, to remain in compliance with the various restrictions and covenants contained in our debt agreements, and to fund working capital, capital expenditures and product development efforts will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which in turn is subject to, among other things, future operating performance as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control.\nWe believe that cash flows from operations, along with our contractually committed borrowings and other borrowing capability, will continue to be sufficient to fund anticipated capital spending requirements and our operations for the foreseeable future. However, we could be adversely affected if the financial institutions providing our capital requirements refuse to honor their contractual commitments, cease lending, or declare bankruptcy. We believe the lending institutions participating in our credit arrangements are financially stable.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n193,638\n$\n464,669\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(65,449\n)\n(35,297\n)\nNet cash used in financing activities\n(442,378\n)\n(136,318\n)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(26,429\n)\n2,138\nNet change in cash and cash equivalents\n(340,618\n)\n295,192\nCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, at beginning of year\n448,462\n153,270\nCash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, at end of year\n$\n107,844\n$\n448,462\n2022 Cash Flows Compared to 2021\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2022 was $193,638, compared to $464,669 for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to production delays from global supply chain disruptions leading to increases in working capital (excluding cash) to support anticipated growth in the next fiscal year, and the timing of cash payments to suppliers.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal year 2022 was $65,449, compared to $35,297 in fiscal year 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to the purchase of PM Control as well as increased payments for property, plant and equipment, partially offset by certain proceeds received in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 in connection with the sale of the renewable power systems business and other related businesses.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal year 2022 was $442,378, compared to net cash flows used in financing activities of $136,318 in fiscal year 2021. The increase in net cash flows used in financing activities in fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 was attributable to repurchases of common stock, partially offset by the change in net debt payments. During fiscal year 2022, we made $485,300 of cash repurchases of common stock, compared to $33,344 of cash repurchases of common stock during fiscal year 2021. During fiscal year 2022, we had net debt payments in the amount of $66,003, compared to net debt payments in the amount of $101,639 in fiscal year 2021.\nNew Accounting Standards\nFrom time to time, the FASB or other standards-setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update.\nTo understand the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted, please review the information provided in Note 2, New accounting standards, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe that the impact of recently issued guidance, whether adopted or to be adopted in the future, is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements upon adoption.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted net earnings, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow are financial measures not prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide additional information that enables readers to evaluate our business from the perspective of management.\nEarnings based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures\nAdjusted net earnings is defined by the Company as net earnings excluding, as applicable, (i) a charge in connection with a non-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, (ii) costs related to business development activities, and (iii) restructuring activities. The Company believes that these excluded items are short-term in nature, not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business and therefore, the exclusion of them illustrates more clearly how the underlying business of Woodward is performing. Management uses adjusted net earnings to evaluate the Companys performance excluding these infrequent or unusual period expenses that are not necessarily indicative of the Companys operating performance for the period. Management defines adjusted earnings per share as adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by the weighted-average number of diluted shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nManagement uses both adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share when comparing operating performance to other periods which may not have similar infrequent or unusual charges.\nThe reconciliation of net earnings and earnings per share to adjusted net earnings and adjusted earnings per share, respectively, for the fiscal years ended and are shown in the tables below.\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Per\nShare\nNet Earnings\nEarnings Per\nShare\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n171,698\n$\n2.71\n$\n208,649\n$\n3.18\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments:\nNon-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, net of tax\n2,454\n0.04\n-\n-\nBusiness development activities, net of tax\n2,236\n0.04\n-\n-\nRestructuring activities, net of tax\n(2,565\n)\n(0.04\n)\n3,736\n0.06\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments\n2,125\n0.04\n3,736\n0.06\nAdjusted net earnings (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n173,823\n$\n2.75\n$\n212,385\n$\n3.24\nManagement uses EBIT to evaluate Woodwards performance without financing and tax related considerations, as these elements may not fluctuate with operating results. Management uses EBITDA in evaluating Woodwards operating performance, making business decisions, including developing budgets, managing expenditures, forecasting future periods, and evaluating capital structure impacts of various strategic scenarios. Securities analysts, investors and others frequently use EBIT and EBITDA in their evaluation of companies, particularly those with significant property, plant, and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization. The Company believes that EBIT and EBITDA are useful measures to the investor when measuring operating performance as they eliminate the impact of financing and tax expenses, which are non-operating expenses and may be driven by factors outside of our operations, such as changes in tax laws or regulations, and, in the case of EBITDA, the noncash charges associated with depreciation and amortization. Further, as interest from financing, income taxes, depreciation and amortization can vary dramatically between companies and between periods, management believes that the removal of these items can improve comparability.\nAdjusted EBIT and adjusted EBITDA represent further non-U.S. GAAP adjustments to EBIT and EBITDA, in each case adjusted to exclude, as applicable, (i) a charge in connection with a non-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business, (ii) costs related to business development activities, and (iii) restructuring activities. As these charges are infrequent or unusual items that can be variable from period to period and do not fluctuate with operating results, management believes that by removing these gains and charges from EBIT and EBITDA it improves comparability of past, present and future operating results and provides consistency when comparing EBIT and EBITDA between periods.\nEBIT and adjusted EBIT reconciled to net earnings were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n171,698\n$\n208,649\nIncome tax expense\n28,200\n37,150\nInterest expense\n34,545\n34,282\nInterest income\n(1,814\n)\n(1,495\n)\nEBIT (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n232,629\n278,586\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments:\nNon-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business\n3,272\n-\nBusiness development activities\n2,982\n-\nRestructuring activities\n(3,420\n)\n5,008\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments\n2,834\n5,008\nAdjusted EBIT (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n235,463\n$\n283,594\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA reconciled to net earnings were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet earnings (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n171,698\n$\n208,649\nIncome tax expense\n28,200\n37,150\nInterest expense\n34,545\n34,282\nInterest income\n(1,814\n)\n(1,495\n)\nAmortization of intangible assets\n37,609\n41,893\nDepreciation expense\n83,019\n87,631\nEBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n353,257\n408,110\nNon-U.S. GAAP adjustments:\nNon-recurring matter unrelated to the ongoing operations of the business\n3,272\n-\nBusiness development activities\n2,982\n-\nRestructuring activities\n(3,420\n)\n5,008\nTotal non-U.S. GAAP adjustments\n2,834\n5,008\nAdjusted EBITDA (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n356,091\n$\n413,118\nThe use of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted effective tax rate, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA exclude certain financial information compared with net earnings, the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, users of this financial information should consider the information that is excluded. Our calculations of adjusted net earnings, adjusted net earnings per share, EBIT, adjusted EBIT, EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures.\nCash flow-based non-U.S. GAAP financial measures\nManagement uses free cash flow, which is defined by the Company as net cash flows provided by operating activities less payments for property, plant and equipment, in reviewing the financial performance of and cash generation by Woodwards various business groups and evaluating cash levels. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it portrays our ability to grow organically and generate cash from our businesses for purposes such as paying interest on our indebtedness, repaying maturing debt, funding business acquisitions, investing in research and development, purchasing our common stock, and paying dividends. In addition, securities analysts, investors, and others frequently use free cash flow in their evaluation of companies. Adjusted free cash flow represents a further non-U.S. GAAP adjustment to free cash flow to exclude the effect of cash paid for business development activities and cash paid for restructuring activities. Management believes that by excluding these infrequent or unusual items from free cash flow it better portrays our ability to generate cash, as such items are not indicative of the Companys operating performance for the period.\nThe use of these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation of, or as substitutes for, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow do not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and are not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Our calculation of free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure.\nFree cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNet cash provided by operating activities (U.S. GAAP)\n$\n193,638\n$\n464,669\nPayments for property, plant and equipment\n(52,868\n)\n(37,689\n)\nFree cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n140,770\n$\n426,980\nCash paid for business development activities\n2,982\n-\nCash paid for restructuring activities\n-\nAdjusted free cash flow (Non-U.S. GAAP)\n$\n144,257\n$\n426,980\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Note 1, Operations and summary of significant accounting policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. The estimates and assumptions described below are those that we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. All of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates, future economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. As estimates are updated or actual amounts are known, our critical accounting estimates are revised, and operating results may be affected by the revised estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosures in this Managements Discussion and Analysis.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue is recognized on contracts with customers for arrangements in which quantities and pricing are fixed and/or determinable and are generally based on customer purchase orders, often within the framework of a long-term supply arrangement with the customer. We recognize revenue for performance obligations within a customer contract when control of the associated product or service is transferred to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Each product within a contract generally represents a separate performance obligation as we do not provide significant installation and integration services, the products do not customize each other, and the products can function independently of each other.\nA contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer obtains control of the associated product or service. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we generally use the observable standalone sales price for each distinct product or service within the contract to allocate the transaction price to the distinct products or services. In instances when a standalone sales price for each product or service is not observable within the contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price for each product or service, which is generally based on incurred costs plus a reasonable margin, for each distinct product or service in the contract.\nWhen determining the transaction price of each contract, we consider contractual consideration payable by the customer and variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration, consisting of early payment discounts, rebates and other sources of price variability, are included in the estimated transaction price based on both customer-specific information as well as historical experience. We regularly review our estimates of variable consideration on the transaction price and recognize changes in estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis as if the most current estimate of the transaction price adjusted for variable consideration had been known as of the inception of the contract.\nPoint in time and over time revenue recognition\nControl of the products generally transfers to the customer at a point in time, as the customer does not control the products as they are produced. We exercise judgment and consider the timing of right of payment, transfer of the risk and rewards, transfers of title, transfer of physical possession, and customer acceptance when determining when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon shipment of products. Performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized over time if: (i) the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being enhanced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use to us; and (ii) we have an enforceable right to payment with a profit. When services are provided, revenue from those services is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to customers as we perform the work.\nFor services that are not short-term in nature, manufacturing, repair and overhaul (MRO), and sales of products that have no alternative use to us and an enforceable right to payment with a profit, we use an actual cost input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For these revenue streams, revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to-date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (the cost-to-cost method). We have concluded that this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, because\nincurred costs are integral to our completion of the performance obligation under the specific customer contract and correlate directly to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Contract cost estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\nInventory\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory cost is determined using methods that approximate the first-in, first-out basis. We include product costs, labor and related fixed and variable overhead in the cost of inventories. Inventory net realizable values are determined by giving substantial consideration to the expected product selling price. We estimate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates, general economic and market conditions, the expected channel of disposition, and current customer contracts and preferences. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to changes in resale or market value and the mix of these factors.\nWe monitor inventory for events or circumstances, such as negative margins, recent sales history suggesting lower sales value, or changes in customer preferences, which would indicate the net realizable value of inventory is less than the carrying value of inventory, and management records adjustments as necessary. When inventory is written down below cost, such reduced amount is considered the cost for subsequent accounting purposes. Our recording of inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value has not historically required material adjustments once initially established.\nThe carrying value of inventory was $514,287 at September 30, 2022 and $419,971 at September 30, 2021. If economic conditions, customer product requirements, or other factors significantly reduce future customer demand for our products from forecast levels, then future adjustments to the carrying value of inventory may become necessary. We attempt to maintain inventory quantities at levels considered necessary to fill firm and expected orders in a reasonable time frame, which we believe mitigates our exposure to future inventory carrying cost adjustments.\nReviews for impairment of goodwill and other indefinitely lived intangible assets\nGoodwill\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $772,559 of goodwill representing 20% of our total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount.\nThe identification of reporting units and consideration of the aggregation of components into a single reporting unit under U.S. GAAP requires management judgment. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of reporting units, determined using discounted cash flows, with their carrying amount including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2022 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The results of our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2022, indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nIndefinitely lived intangible asset\nWe have one indefinitely lived intangible asset consisting of the Woodward LOrange trade name. At September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset was $56,838, representing 2% of our total assets. The Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward LOrange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recorded any impairment charges associated with the indefinitely lived intangible asset.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we completed the annual impairment test, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset as of July 31, 2022. The results of the annual impairment test performed as of July 31, 2022 indicated the estimated fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nAs part of our ongoing monitoring efforts to assess goodwill and the Woodward LOrange trade name indefinite lived asset for possible indications of impairment, we will continue to consider a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to the global economic environment and its potential impact on our business. There can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows of certain reporting units or the Woodward LOrange business, the current economic environment, or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows will prove to be accurate projections of future performance.\nIncome taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The reserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate. Although we believe our reserves are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be consistent with what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the current provision for income taxes.\nSignificant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. The determination of the amount of valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences, expected future taxable income, and the impact of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is established to offset any deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income, and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. Changes in the relevant facts can significantly impact the judgment or need for valuation allowances. In the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nOur provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by earnings that are different than those anticipated in countries which have lower or higher tax rates; by transfer pricing adjustments; and/or changes in tax laws, regulations, and accounting principles, including accounting for uncertain tax positions, or interpretations thereof. There can be no assurance that these items will remain stable over time. Additionally, Woodward records through income tax expense all future excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from stock options exercised. This creates unpredictable volatility in the effective tax rate because the additional expense or benefit recognized each quarter is based on the timing of the employees election to exercise any vested stock options outstanding, which is outside Woodwards control, and the market price of Woodwards shares at the time of exercise, which is subject to market volatility.\nOur effective tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations, adjustments of valuation allowances, research tax credits, state taxes, and tax audit settlements. In addition to potential local country tax law and policy changes that could impact the provision for income taxes, managements judgment about\nand intentions concerning the repatriation of foreign earnings could also significantly impact the provision for income taxes. Management reassesses its judgment regularly, taking into consideration the potential tax impacts of these judgments and intentions. Item 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIn the normal course of business, we have exposures to interest rate risk from our long-term and short-term debt, and our postretirement benefit plans, and foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations and foreign currency transactions.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk, Interest Rate Risk, and Related Hedging Activities\nWe are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates when we sell product in currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred. The functional currencies and our purchasing and sales activities primarily include USD, EUR, RMB, JPY and GBP. We may also be impacted by changes in the relative buying power of our customers, which may impact sales volumes either positively or negatively. As these currencies fluctuate against each other, and other currencies, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk on sales, purchasing transactions, and labor. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is reduced through the maintenance of local production facilities in the markets we serve, which we believe creates a natural hedge to our foreign currency exchange rate exposure.\nThe percentages of our net sales denominated in a currency other than the USD were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\nFunctional currency:\nEUR\n15.7\n%\n14.2\n%\nRMB\n3.4\n%\n8.0\n%\nJPY\n2.9\n%\n1.3\n%\nGBP\n1.7\n%\n2.6\n%\nAll other foreign currencies\n1.9\n%\n1.5\n%\n25.6\n%\n27.6\n%\nCurrency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the USD while another currency weakens. Because of the complex interrelationship of our worldwide supply chains and distribution channels, it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates.\nWe use derivative instruments as risk management tools that involve complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. From time to time, we will enter into a foreign currency exchange rate contract to hedge against changes in foreign currency exchange rates on liabilities expected to be settled at a future date. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative instruments that result from a change in foreign currency exchange rates. We minimize this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types of, and degree to which we enter into, derivative instruments. We enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only. We do not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had no open foreign currency exchange rate contracts and all previous exchange rate derivative instruments were settled or terminated.\nFor more information on derivative instruments, see Note 8, Derivative instruments and hedging activities, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Woodward, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Woodward, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive earnings, shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and\ndirectors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nIntangible Assets, net - Trade name - Refer to Notes 1 and 14 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has one indefinitely lived intangible asset consisting of the Woodward LOrange trade name (trade name). As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the trade name is $56.8 million. The trade name is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the trade name may be below its carrying amount. The Company completed its annual impairment test of the trade name as of July 31, 2022. The results of impairment test indicated the estimated fair value of the trade name was in excess of its carrying value and, accordingly, no impairment existed.\nThe fair value of the trade name was determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates and the present value of the forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate. The Company projects revenue growth rates and cash flows based on Woodward LOranges current operational results, expected performance and operational strategies over a five-year period. These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products and require considerable management judgment. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value.\nWe identified the fair value of the trade name as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments and assumptions management makes related to the projection of revenue growth rates and the selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and royalty rate. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements projection of revenue growth rates and selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and royalty rate.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the projection of revenue growth rates and selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate used in determining the fair value of the trade name included the following, among others:\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the fair value of the trade name, including those over the projection of revenue growth rates and the selection of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and royalty rate.\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rate, terminal growth rate, and royalty rate by:\n\u2212\nTesting the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate, terminal growth rate and royalty rate and recalculating the mathematical accuracy of managements calculation of the discount rate\n\u2212\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates over the discount rate and terminal growth rate and comparing those to the discount and terminal growth rates selected by management\n\u2212\nComparing the royalty rate from comparable licensing agreements to the rate selected by management\n\u2212\nSearching for any events which could adversely impact the fair value of the brand\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of managements projected revenue growth rates by:\n\u2212\nComparing managements projections to:\n\u2212\nHistorical revenue results for Woodward LOrange\n\u2212\nInternal communications to management and the board of directors\n\u2212\nAnalyst and industry reports\n\u2212\nPeer company forecasts\n\u2212\nConsidering the impact of changes in managements projections from the July 31, 2022, annual assessment date to September 30, 2022 by comparing actual results for the period to management projections within the original valuation model.\nWe evaluated whether a triggering event existed subsequent to managements impairment testing date, but prior to the balance sheet date.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nDenver,

Consolidated Financial Statements\nWOODWARD, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\nNote 1. Operations and summary of significant accounting policies\nBasis of presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include the accounts of Woodward, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively Woodward or the Company). Dollar amounts contained in these Consolidated Financial Statements are in thousands, except per share amounts.\nNature of operations\nWoodward is an independent designer, manufacturer, and service provider of energy control and optimization solutions. Woodward designs, produces and services reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applications in challenging environments. Woodward has significant production and assembly facilities primarily in the United States, Europe and Asia, and promotes its products and services through its worldwide locations.\nWoodwards strategic focus is providing energy control and optimization solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets. The precise and efficient control of energy, including motion, fluid, combustion and electrical energy, is a growing requirement in the markets Woodward serves. Woodwards customers look to it to optimize the efficiency, emissions and operation of power equipment in both commercial and defense operations. Woodwards core technologies leverage well across its markets and customer applications, enabling it to develop and integrate cost-effective and state-of-the-art fuel, combustion, fluid, actuation and electronic systems. Woodward focuses its solutions and services primarily on serving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and equipment packagers, partnering with them to bring superior component and system solutions to their demanding applications. Woodward also provides aftermarket repair, maintenance, replacement and other service support for its installed products.\nWoodwards components and integrated systems optimize performance of commercial aircraft, defense aircraft, military ground vehicles and other equipment, gas and steam turbines, industrial diesel, gas, biodiesel and dual-fuel reciprocating engines, and electrical power systems. Woodwards innovative motion, fluid, combustion and electrical energy control systems help its customers offer more cost-effective, cleaner, and more reliable equipment.\nGlobal Business Conditions\nWe continue to monitor a variety of external issues impacting our business, including ongoing global supply chain and labor disruptions and rising labor and material inflation which together have led to a challenging industry-wide operating environment.\nIn fiscal year 2022 we experienced strong demand for our products and services, although our financial performance during fiscal year 2022 was adversely impacted by these issues. We are actively implementing strategies to mitigate our supply chain risk to better position us for future success. We also continue to assess the environment and are taking appropriate price actions in response to rising costs; however, the timing of many price increases can be delayed due to various pre-existing contractual arrangements. We remain focused on operational excellence initiatives, talent development and innovation to help drive the company forward and create value for our stockholders. We are unable to predict the full extent to which these issues will continue to adversely impact our business, including our operational performance, results of operations, cash flows, financial position, and the achievement of our strategic objectives. Such uncertainty may affect our ability to accurately predict our future performance and financial results.\nWe may take further actions to alter our business operations if we determine such actions are in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, customers and other stakeholders as appropriate. It is not currently clear what the potential effects of any such alterations or modifications may have on our business in future periods, including the effects on our customers, employees and prospects, or on our financial results.\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation: These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of Woodward and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. Transactions within and between these companies are eliminated.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period, and certain financial statement disclosures. Significant estimates include allowances for uncollectible amounts, net realizable value of inventories, customer rebates earned, useful lives of property and identifiable intangible assets, the evaluation of impairments of property, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, the provision for income tax and related valuation reserves, the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations, assumptions used in the determination of the funded status and annual expense of pension and postretirement employee benefit plans, the valuation of stock compensation instruments granted to employees, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign currency exchange rates: The assets and liabilities of substantially all subsidiaries outside the United States are translated at fiscal year-end rates of exchange, and earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted-average rates of exchange. The exchange rate in effect at the time of the cash flow is used for significant or infrequent cash flows, such as payments for a business acquisition, for which the use of weighted-average rates of exchange would result in a substantially different cash flow. Translation adjustments are accumulated with other comprehensive (losses) earnings as a separate component of stockholders equity and are presented net of tax effects in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity. The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on loans between consolidated subsidiaries that are considered permanent in nature are also accumulated with other comprehensive earnings, net of tax.\nThe Company is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because some sales transactions, and certain assets and liabilities of its domestic and foreign subsidiaries, are denominated in foreign currencies. Selling, general, and administrative expenses include a net foreign currency gain of $1,450 in fiscal year 2022, a net foreign currency loss of $1,986 in fiscal year 2021, and a net foreign currency gain of $194 in fiscal year 2020.\nRevenue recognition: Revenue is recognized on contracts with customers for arrangements in which quantities and pricing are fixed and/or determinable and are generally based on customer purchase orders, often within the framework of a long-term supply arrangement with the customer. Woodward has determined that it is the principal in its sales transactions, as Woodward is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promised performance obligations, has discretion to establish the selling price, and generally assumes the inventory risk. Woodward recognizes revenue for performance obligations within a customer contract when control of the associated product or service is transferred to the customer. Some of Woodwards contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while other contracts contain multiple performance obligations. Each product within a contract generally represents a separate performance obligation as Woodward does not provide significant installation and integration services, the products do not customize each other, and the products can function independently of each other.\nA contract's transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the customer obtains control of the associated product or service. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, Woodward generally uses the observable standalone sales price for each distinct product or service within the contract to allocate the transaction price to the distinct products or services. In instances when a standalone sales price for each product or service is not observable within the contract, Woodward allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price for each product or service, which is generally based on incurred costs plus a reasonable margin, for each distinct product or service in the contract.\nWhen determining the transaction price of each contract, Woodward considers contractual consideration payable by the customer and variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price. Variable consideration, consisting of early payment discounts, rebates and other sources of price variability, are included in the estimated transaction price based on both customer-specific information as well as historical experience.\nCustomers sometimes trade in used products in exchange for new or refurbished products. In addition, Woodwards customers sometimes provide inventory to Woodward which will be integrated into final products sold to those customers. Woodward obtains control of these exchanged products and customer provided inventory, and therefore, both are forms of noncash consideration. Noncash consideration paid by customers on overall sales transactions is additive to the transaction price. Woodwards net sales and cost of goods sold include the value of such noncash consideration for the same amount, with no resulting impact to earnings before income taxes. Upon receipt of such inventory, Woodward recognizes an inventory asset and a contract liability.\nPoint in time and over time revenue recognition: Control of the products generally transfers to the customer at a point in time, as the customer does not control the products as they are produced. Performance obligations are satisfied and revenue is recognized over time if: (i) the customer receives the benefits as Woodward performs work, if the customer\ncontrols the asset as it is being enhanced, or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use to Woodward; and (ii) Woodward has an enforceable right to payment with a profit. For products being produced for the customer that have no alternative use to Woodward and Woodward has an enforceable right to payment with a profit, and where the products are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer, revenue is recognized as a series of distinct products. As Woodward satisfies manufacturing, repair and overhaul (MRO) performance obligations, revenue is recognized over time, as the customer, rather than Woodward, controls the asset being enhanced. When services are provided, revenue from those services is recognized over time because control is transferred continuously to customers as Woodward performs the work.\nFor services that are not short-term in nature, MRO, and sales of products that have no alternative use to Woodward and an enforceable right to payment with a profit, Woodward uses an actual cost input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. For these revenue streams, revenue is recognized over time as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to-date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (the cost-to-cost method). Woodward has concluded that this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of assets to the customer, because incurred costs are integral to Woodwards completion of the performance obligation under the specific customer contract and correlate directly to the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Contract cost estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\nIf at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, Woodward recognizes provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in the period in which such losses are determined. In situations where the creditworthiness of a customer becomes in doubt, Woodward ceases to recognize the over-time revenue on the associated customer contract.\nOccasionally, Woodward sells maintenance or service arrangements, extended warranties, or other stand ready services. Woodward recognizes revenue from such arrangements as a series of performance obligations over the time period in which the services are available to the customer.\nPurchase accounting: Business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Under this method, assets and liabilities, including intangible assets, are recorded at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Acquisition costs in excess of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded as goodwill. Transaction-related costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred.\nMaterial Rights and Costs to Fulfill a Contract: Customers sometimes pay consideration to Woodward for product engineering and development activities that do not result in the immediate transfer of distinct products or services to the customer. There is an implicit assumption that without the customer making such advance payments to Woodward, Woodwards future sales of products or services to the customer would be at a higher selling price; therefore, such payments create a material right to the customer that effectively gives the customer an option to acquire future products or services, at a discount, that are dependent upon the product engineering and development. Material rights are recorded as contract liabilities and will be recognized when control of the related products or services are transferred to the customer.\nWoodward capitalizes costs of product engineering and development identified as material rights up to the amount of customer funding as costs to fulfill a contract because the costs incurred up to the amount of the customer funding commitment are recoverable. Due to the uncertainty of the product success and/or demand, fulfillment costs in excess of the customer funding are expensed as incurred. Woodward recognizes the deferred material rights as revenue based on a percentage of actual sales to total estimated lifetime sales of the related developed products as the customers exercise their option to acquire additional products or services at a discount. Woodward amortizes the capitalized costs to fulfill a contract as cost of goods sold proportionally to the recognition of the associated deferred material rights. Estimated total lifetime sales are reviewed at least annually and more frequently when circumstances warrant a modification to the previous estimate.\nWoodward does not capitalize incremental costs of obtaining a contract, as Woodward does not pay sales commissions or incur other incremental costs related to contracts with Woodwards customers for arrangements in which quantities and pricing are fixed and/or determinable.\nContract liabilities: Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized represent contract liabilities and are recorded as deferred revenues when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of Woodward satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations satisfied over time. Woodward generally receives advance payments from customers related to maintenance or service arrangements, extended warranties, or other stand ready services, which it recognizes over the performance period. Contract liabilities are satisfied when revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized are included in deferred revenue, which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when Woodward expects to recognize revenue.\nCustomer payments: Woodward occasionally agrees to make payments to certain customers in order to participate in anticipated sales activity. Payments made to customers are accounted for as a reduction of revenue unless they are made in exchange for identifiable goods or services with fair values that can be reasonably estimated. Reductions in revenue associated with these customer payments are recognized immediately to the extent that the payments cannot be attributed to anticipated future sales, and are recognized in future periods to the extent that the payments relate to anticipated future sales. Such determinations are based on the facts and circumstances underlying each payment.\nStock-based compensation: Compensation cost relating to stock-based payment awards made to employees and directors is recognized in the financial statements using a fair value method. Non-qualified stock option awards and restricted stock awards are issued under Woodwards stock-based compensation plans. The cost of such awards, measured at the grant date, is based on the estimated fair value of the award.\nForfeitures are estimated at the time of each grant in order to estimate the portion of the award that will ultimately vest. The estimate is based on Woodwards historical rates of forfeitures and is updated periodically. The portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods, which is generally the vesting period of the awards.\nResearch and development costs: Company funded expenditures related to new product development, and significant product enhancement and/or upgrade activities are expensed as incurred and are separately reported in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIncome taxes: Deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of Woodwards assets, liabilities, and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive (losses) earnings. Woodward provides for taxes that may be payable if undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries were to be remitted to the United States, except for those earnings that it considers to be indefinitely invested.\nCash equivalents: Highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts receivable: Almost all of Woodwards sales are made on credit and result in accounts receivable, which are recorded at the amount invoiced and are generally not collateralized. In the normal course of business, not all accounts receivable are collected and, therefore, an allowance for uncollectible amounts is provided equal to the amount that Woodward believes ultimately will not be collected, either from credit risk or other adjustments to the original selling price or anticipated cash discounts. In establishing the amount of the allowance related to the credit risk of accounts receivable, customer-specific information is considered related to delinquent accounts, past loss experience, bankruptcy filings, deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position, current and forecasted economic conditions, and other relevant factors. Bad debt losses are deducted from the allowance, and the related accounts receivable balances are written off when the receivables are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recognized when received. The allowance associated with anticipated other adjustments to the selling price or cash discounts is also established and is included in the allowance for uncollectible amounts. In establishing this amount, both customer-specific information as well as historical experience is considered.\nIn coordination with its customers and when terms are considered favorable to Woodward, Woodward from time-to-time transfers ownership to collect amounts due to Woodward for outstanding accounts receivable to third parties in exchange for cash. When the transfer of accounts receivable meets the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 860-10, Transfers and Servicing, and are without recourse, it is recognized as a sale and the accounts receivable is derecognized.\nUnbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions require revenue to be recognized over time rather than at a point in time. Unbilled\nreceivables primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to payment in accordance with contractual terms. Unbilled receivables are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nConsistent with common business practice in China, Woodwards Chinese subsidiaries accept bankers acceptance notes from Chinese customers in settlement of certain customer billed accounts receivable. Bankers acceptance notes are financial instruments issued by Chinese financial institutions as part of financing arrangements between the financial institution and a customer of the financial institution. Bankers acceptance notes represent a commitment by the issuing financial institution to pay a certain amount of money at a specified future maturity date to the legal owner of the bankers acceptance note as of the maturity date. The maturity date of bankers acceptance notes varies, but it is Woodwards policy to only accept bankers acceptance notes with maturity dates no more than 180 days from the date of Woodwards receipt of such draft. Woodward has elected to adopt the practical expedient to not adjust the promised amounts of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component at contract inception as the financing component associated with accepting bankers acceptance notes has a duration of less than one year. Woodwards contracts with customers generally have no other financing components.\nFor composition of accounts receivable, see Note 3, Revenue.\nInventories: Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using methods that approximate a first-in, first-out basis.\nShort-term investments: From time to time, certain of Woodwards foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term time deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial institutions. Amounts with maturities of less than 365 days are classified as Other current assets.\nProperty, plant, and equipment: Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Assets are generally depreciated using the straight-line method. Assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nEstimated lives over which fixed assets are generally depreciated at September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nLand improvements\n-\nyears\nBuildings and improvements\n-\nyears\nLeasehold improvements\n-\nyears\nMachinery and production equipment\n-\nyears\nComputer equipment and software\n-\nyears\nOffice furniture and equipment\n-\nyears\nOther\n-\nyears\nIncluded in computer equipment and software are Woodwards enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, which have an estimated useful life of 15 years. All other computer equipment and software is generally depreciated over three years to five years.\nLeases: Right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the remaining fixed lease payments over the lease term. In determining the estimated present value of lease payments, Woodward discounts the fixed lease payments using the rate implicit in the agreement or, if the implicit rate is not known, using the incremental borrowing rate. Woodwards incremental borrowing rate is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, with consideration given to Woodwards recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics.\nFor operating leases, lease expense is recognized over the expected lease term and classified as a cost of goods sold or selling, general and administrative expense based on the nature of the underlying leased asset. For finance leases, the ROU asset is recognized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset, consistent with Woodwards normal depreciation policy, or the lease term, and is classified as a cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expense, or research and development expense, based on the nature and use of the underlying leased asset.\nCertain of Woodwards operating lease agreements include variable payments that are passed through by the landlord, such as insurance, taxes, and common area maintenance, payments based on the usage of the asset, and rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Pass-through charges, payments due to changes in usage of the asset, and\npayments due to changes in indexation are included within variable rent expense and are recognized in the period in which the variable obligation for the payments was incurred.\nGoodwill: Woodward tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the fair value of a reporting unit may be below its carrying amount. Based on the relevant U.S. GAAP authoritative guidance, Woodward aggregates components of a single operating segment into a reporting unit, if appropriate. The impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount that includes goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value, Woodward compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the recorded carrying amount of goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value.\nBased on the results of Woodwards annual goodwill impairment testing, no impairment charges were recorded in the year ended September 30, 2022 or since the goodwill was originally recorded due to the annual goodwill impairment test.\nOther intangibles: Other intangibles are recognized apart from goodwill whenever an acquired intangible asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, or whenever it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented, or exchanged, either individually or in combination with a related contract, asset, or liability. Woodward amortizes the cost of other intangibles over their useful lives unless such lives are deemed indefinite. The cost of finite-lived other intangibles are amortized over their respective useful life using patterns that reflect the periods over which the economic benefits of the assets are expected to be realized. Amortization expense is allocated to cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses based on the nature of the intangible asset. Finite-lived other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change indicating that the related carrying amount of the other intangible asset may not be recoverable. Impairment losses are recognized if the carrying amount of an intangible is both not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWoodward has recorded no impairment charges related to its other intangibles as of September 30, 2022.\nEstimated lives over which intangible assets are amortized at September 30, 2022 were as follows:\nCustomer relationships and contracts\n-\nyears\nIntellectual property\n-\nyears\nProcess technology\n-\nyears\nOther\n-\nyears\nWoodward has one indefinitely lived intangible asset consisting of the Woodward LOrange trade name. The Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset is tested for impairment on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the fair value of the Woodward LOrange intangible asset may be below its carrying amount. The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward LOrange intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recorded any impairment charges.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: Woodward reviews the carrying amount of its long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others.\nIf such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying amount of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.\nInvestment in marketable equity securities: Woodward holds marketable equity securities related to its deferred compensation program. Based on Woodwards intentions regarding these instruments, marketable equity securities are classified as trading securities. The trading securities are reported at fair value, with realized gains and losses recognized in Other (income) expense, net. The trading securities are included in Other assets. The associated obligation to provide benefits under the deferred compensation program is included in Other liabilities.\nInvestments in unconsolidated subsidiaries: Investments in, and operating results of, entities in which Woodward does not have a controlling financial interest or the ability to exercise significant influence over the operations are included in the financial statements using the cost method of accounting. Investments and operating results of entities in which Woodward does not have a controlling interest but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations are included in the financial statements using the equity method of accounting.\nDeferred compensation: The Company maintains a deferred compensation plan, or rabbi trust, as part of its overall compensation package for certain employees.\nDeferred compensation obligations will be settled either by delivery of a fixed number of shares of Woodwards common stock (in accordance with certain eligible members irrevocable elections) or in cash. Woodward has contributed shares of its common stock into a trust established for the future settlement of deferred compensation obligations that are payable in shares of Woodwards common stock. Common stock held by the trust is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Treasury stock held for deferred compensation and the related deferred compensation obligation is reflected as a separate component of equity in amounts equal to the fair value of the common stock at the dates of contribution. These accounts are not adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of the common stock. Deferred compensation obligations that will be settled in cash are accounted for on an accrual basis in accordance with the terms of the underlying contract and are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as Other liabilities.\nFinancial instruments: The Companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, investments in the deferred compensation program, notes receivable from municipalities, investments in term deposits, cross-currency interest rate swaps and debt. Because of their short-term maturity, the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, and short-term debt approximate fair value. Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into the following levels:\nLevel 1: Inputs based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable and can be corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3: Inputs reflect managements best estimates and assumptions of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the valuation of the instruments.\nFurther information on the fair value of financial instruments can be found at Note 7, Financial instruments and fair value measurements.\nDerivatives: The Company is exposed to various global market risks, including the effect of changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, changes in certain commodity prices and fluctuations in various producer indices. From time to time, Woodward enters into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as accounting hedges and/or those utilized as economic hedges. Woodward uses interest rate related derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations of interest rates. Woodward does not enter into or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nBy using derivative and/or hedging instruments to manage its risk exposure, Woodward is subject, from time to time, to credit risk and market risk on those derivative instruments. Credit risk arises from the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative and/or hedging instrument. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes Woodward, which creates credit risk for Woodward. Woodward mitigates this credit risk by entering into transactions only with counterparties that are believed to be creditworthy. Market risk arises from the potential adverse effects on the value of derivative and/or hedging instruments that result from a change in interest rates, commodity prices, or foreign currency exchange rates. Woodward minimizes this market risk by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.\nFrom time to time, in order to hedge against foreign currency exposure, Woodward designates certain non-derivative financial instrument loans as net investment hedges. Foreign exchange gains or losses on these loans are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments within total comprehensive (losses) earnings. Also, to hedge against the foreign currency exposure attributable to non-functional currency denominated intercompany loans, Woodward has entered into derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships and cash flow hedging relationships.\nFurther information on net investment hedges and derivative instruments in fair value and cash flow hedging relationships, including the Companys policy in accounting for these derivatives, can be found at Note 8, Derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nPostretirement benefits: The Company provides various benefits to certain current and former employees through defined benefit pension and postretirement plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic benefits expense and related obligations are calculated using a number of significant actuarial assumptions. Changes in net periodic expense and funding status may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. The funded status of defined pension and postretirement plans recognized in the statement of financial position is measured as the difference between the fair market value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other defined benefit postretirement plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated benefit obligation. Any over-funded status is recognized as an asset and any underfunded status is recognized as a liability.\nProjected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation, if applicable, prior to that date. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels.\nNote 2. New accounting standards\nFrom time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements. Updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) are communicated through issuance of an Accounting Standards Update (ASU). Recently adopted or anticipated impacts of significant future ASUs are described below, as applicable.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting. The purpose of ASU 2020-04 is to provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on financial reporting. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates, and, in particular, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), reference rate reform refers to a global initiative to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction-based and less susceptible to manipulation. ASU 2020-04 is effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. Once elected for a topic or an industry subtopic, the amendments in ASU 2020-04 must be applied prospectively for all eligible contract modifications for that topic or industry subtopic. Woodward has assessed the accounting and financial impact of ASU 2020-04, and concluded no financial assets or liabilities, including those involved in hedging relationships, will be materially impacted as a result of the cessation of LIBOR. Accordingly, Woodward will not elect to apply the amendments in ASU 2020-04 for contract modifications.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 amends ASC 740 to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for investments, intraperiod allocations and interim calculations, and adding guidance to reduce complexity in the accounting standard under the FASBs simplification initiative. ASU 2019-12 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 (fiscal year 2022 for Woodward). Upon adoption, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 should be applied on a prospective basis to all periods presented. Woodward elected to early adopt the new guidance effective January 1, 2021, which did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 adds a current expected credit loss (CECL) impairment model to U.S. GAAP that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Modified retrospective adoption is required with any cumulative-effect adjustment recorded to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal year 2021 for Woodward), including interim periods within the year of adoption. Woodward adopted ASU 2016-13, and all applicable amendments, on October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective adoption method. Based on the nature of the Companys financial instruments included within the scope of this standard, the adoption did not have a material effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements. See details of the Companys allowance for uncollectible amounts and change in expected credit losses for billed receivables and unbilled receivables (contract assets) at Note 3, Revenue.\nNote 3. Revenue\nSales of Products\nWoodward primarily generates revenue through the manufacture and sale of engineered aerospace and industrial products, including revenue derived from MRO performance obligations performed on products originally manufactured by Woodward and subsequently returned by OEM or other end-user customers. The majority of Woodwards costs incurred to satisfy MRO performance obligations are related to replacing and/or refurbishing component parts of the returned products to restore the units back to a condition generally comparable to that of the unit upon its initial sale to an OEM customer. Therefore, Woodward considers almost all of its revenue to be derived from product sales, including those related to MRO.\nYear Ended September 30,\nManufactured products\n%\n%\n%\nMRO\n%\n%\n%\nServices\n%\n%\n%\nPoint in time and over time revenue recognition\nThe amount of revenue recognized as point in time or over time follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nPoint in time\n$\n593,233\n$\n509,737\n$\n1,102,970\n$\n481,422\n$\n527,233\n$\n1,008,655\n$\n590,817\n$\n592,157\n$\n1,182,974\nOver time\n926,089\n353,731\n1,279,820\n922,695\n314,482\n1,237,177\n1,000,146\n312,545\n1,312,691\nTotal net sales\n$\n1,519,322\n$\n863,468\n$\n2,382,790\n$\n1,404,117\n$\n841,715\n$\n2,245,832\n$\n1,590,963\n$\n904,702\n$\n2,495,665\nMaterial Rights and Costs to Fulfill a Contract\nAmounts recognized related to changes in estimated total lifetime sales for material rights and costs to fulfill contracts with customers follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue\n$\n1,514\n$\n2,671\n$\n6,784\nCost of goods sold\n1,961\n6,638\nAmounts recognized related to amortization of costs to fulfill contracts and contract liabilities, which were not related to changes in estimate, follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nRevenue\n$\n4,107\n$\n4,455\n$\n1,664\nCost of goods sold\n3,077\n3,466\n1,241\nAs of September 30, 2022, Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets included $167,610 of capitalized costs to fulfill contracts with customers, compared to $152,885 as of September 30, 2021.\nAccounts Receivable and Contract assets\nCustomer receivables include amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as unbilled amounts (contract assets) and are included in Accounts receivable in Woodwards Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts are billed in accordance with contractual terms, which are generally tied to shipment of the products to the customer, or as work progresses in accordance with contractual terms. Billed accounts receivable are typically due within 60 days. Woodwards contracts with customers generally have no financing components.\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nBilled receivables\nTrade accounts receivable\n$\n359,364\n$\n298,951\nOther (Chinese financial institutions)\n9,405\n23,168\nTotal billed receivables\n368,769\n322,119\nCurrent unbilled receivables (contract assets)\n245,117\n204,596\nTotal accounts receivable\n613,886\n526,715\nLess: Allowance for uncollectible amounts\n(3,922\n)\n(3,664\n)\nTotal accounts receivable, net\n$\n609,964\n$\n523,051\nAs of September 30, 2022, Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes $6,649 of unbilled receivables not expected to be invoiced and collected within a period of twelve months, compared to $9,424 as of September 30, 2021. Unbilled receivables not expected to be invoiced and collected within a period of twelve months are primarily attributable to customer delays for deliveries on firm orders in the Aerospace segment due to global supply chain and labor disruptions.\nBilled and unbilled accounts receivable from the U.S. Government were less than 10% of total billed and unbilled accounts receivable at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nThe allowance for uncollectible amounts and change in expected credit losses for trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables (contract assets) consisted of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\nBalance, beginning\n$\n3,664\n$\n8,359\n$\n8,936\nCharged to costs and expenses, or sales allowance\n1,866\n2,382\n4,735\nDeductions\n(1,587\n)\n(7,255\n)\n(5,342\n)\nOther (deductions)/additions1\n(21\n)\nBalance, ending\n$\n3,922\n$\n3,664\n$\n8,359\n(1)\nIncludes effects of foreign exchange rate changes during the period.\nWoodward adopted ASU 2016-13 on October 1, 2021. The change in the allowance for uncollectible amounts during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, is based on incurred losses rather than expected credit losses per the CECL impairment model.\nContract liabilities\nContract liabilities consisted of the following:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCurrent\nNoncurrent\nCurrent\nNoncurrent\nDeferred revenue from material rights from GE joint venture formation\n$\n5,754\n$\n234,516\n$\n4,771\n$\n234,237\nDeferred revenue from advanced invoicing and/or prepayments from customers\n4,120\n4,192\nLiability related to customer supplied inventory\n12,442\n-\n14,169\n-\nDeferred revenue from material rights related to engineering and development funding\n8,347\n161,791\n6,395\n151,797\nNet contract liabilities\n$\n30,663\n$\n396,345\n$\n29,527\n$\n386,324\nThe current portion of contract liabilities is included in Accrued liabilities and the noncurrent portion is included in Other liabilities of Woodwards Consolidated Balance Sheets. Woodward recognized revenue of $22,313 in the year ended September 30, 2022 from contract liabilities balances recorded as of September 30, 2021, compared to $19,925 in the year ended September 30, 2021 from contract liabilities balances recorded as of September 30, 2020.\nWoodward recognized revenue of $65,702 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $71,517 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and $79,569 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, related to noncash consideration received from customers. The Aerospace segment recognized $63,358 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $69,195 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and $78,179 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, while the Industrial segment recognized $2,343 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2,322 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and $1,390 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nRemaining performance obligations\nRemaining performance obligations related to the aggregate amount of the total contract transaction price of firm orders for which the performance obligation has not yet been recognized in revenue as of September 30, 2022 was $1,558,588, compared to $1,283,311 as of September 30, 2021, the majority of which in both periods relate to Woodwards Aerospace segment. Woodward expects to recognize almost all of these remaining performance obligations within two years after September 30, 2022.\nRemaining performance obligations related to material rights that have not yet been recognized in revenue as of September 30, 2022 was $448,370, of which $12,718 is expected to be recognized in fiscal year 2023, and the balance is expected to be recognized thereafter. Woodward expects to recognize revenue from performance obligations related to material rights over the life of the underlying programs, which may be as long as forty years.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWoodward designs, produces and services reliable, efficient, low-emission, and high-performance energy control products for diverse applications in markets throughout the world. Woodward reports financial results for each of its Aerospace and Industrial reportable segments. Woodward further disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by primary market and by geographical area as Woodward believes this best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nRevenue by primary market for the Aerospace reportable segment was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nCommercial OEM\n$\n499,438\n$\n386,543\n$\n434,306\nCommercial aftermarket\n420,881\n306,547\n399,843\nDefense OEM\n422,016\n509,815\n526,264\nDefense aftermarket\n176,987\n201,212\n230,550\nTotal Aerospace segment net sales\n$\n1,519,322\n$\n1,404,117\n$\n1,590,963\nRevenue by primary market for the Industrial reportable segment was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nReciprocating engines\n$\n636,866\n$\n639,946\n$\n632,555\nIndustrial turbines\n226,602\n201,769\n222,366\nRenewables1\n-\n-\n49,781\nTotal Industrial segment net sales\n$\n863,468\n$\n841,715\n$\n904,702\n(1)\nSales in the renewables market were discontinued as of May 1, 2020 following the closing of the divestiture of the disposal group (see Note 10, Acquisitions and Divestitures).\nThe customers who account for approximately 10% or more of net sales of each of Woodwards reportable segments are as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\nAerospace\nRaytheon Technologies, The Boeing Company, GE\nThe Boeing Company, Raytheon Technologies, GE\nIndustrial\nRolls-Royce PLC,\nW\u00e4rtsil\u00e4, Caterpillar\nRolls-Royce PLC,\nWeichai Westport, GE\nNet sales by geographic area, as determined based on the location of the customer, were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nAerospace\nIndustrial\nConsolidated\nUnited States\n$\n1,105,860\n$\n205,740\n$\n1,311,600\n$\n1,103,373\n$\n174,750\n$\n1,278,123\n$\n1,231,004\n$\n195,450\n$\n1,426,454\nGermany\n57,840\n174,216\n232,056\n31,005\n152,691\n183,696\n52,635\n181,330\n233,965\nEurope, excluding Germany\n128,719\n234,795\n363,514\n95,984\n195,957\n291,941\n122,938\n214,033\n336,971\nChina\n49,407\n86,972\n136,379\n35,286\n178,983\n214,269\n38,359\n171,526\n209,885\nAsia, excluding China\n23,334\n128,855\n152,189\n23,363\n114,137\n137,500\n27,068\n113,001\n140,069\nOther countries\n154,162\n32,890\n187,052\n115,106\n25,197\n140,303\n118,959\n29,362\n148,321\nTotal net sales\n$\n1,519,322\n$\n863,468\n$\n2,382,790\n$\n1,404,117\n$\n841,715\n$\n2,245,832\n$\n1,590,963\n$\n904,702\n$\n2,495,665\nNote 4. Earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period.\nDiluted earnings per share reflects the weighted-average number of shares outstanding after consideration of the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net earnings to basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share:\nYear Ended September 30,\nNumerator:\nNet earnings\n$\n171,698\n$\n208,649\n$\n240,395\nDenominator:\nBasic shares outstanding\n61,517\n63,287\n62,267\nDilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units\n1,737\n2,268\n1,942\nDiluted shares outstanding\n63,254\n65,555\n64,209\nIncome per common share:\nBasic earnings per share\n$\n2.79\n$\n3.30\n$\n3.86\nDiluted earnings per share\n$\n2.71\n$\n3.18\n$\n3.74\nThe following stock option grants were outstanding during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, but were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.\nYear Ended September 30,\nOptions\n1,019\nWeighted-average option price\n$\n110.71\n$\n116.38\n$\n104.45\nThe weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share included the weighted-average treasury stock shares held for deferred compensation obligations of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\nWeighted-average treasury stock shares held for deferred compensation obligations\nNote 5. Leases\nWoodward is primarily a lessee in lease arrangements but has some embedded lessor arrangements.\nLessee arrangements\nWoodward has entered into operating leases for certain facilities and equipment with terms in excess of one year under agreements that expire at various dates. Some leases require the payment of property taxes, insurance, maintenance costs, or other similar costs in addition to rental payments. Woodward has also entered into finance leases for equipment with terms in excess of one year under agreements that expire at various dates.\nNone of Woodwards lease agreements contain significant residual value guarantees, restrictions, or covenants. As of September 30, 2022, Woodward has not entered into any lease arrangements that have not yet commenced but would create significant rights and obligations. Woodward does not have any lease transactions between related parties.\nLease-related assets and liabilities follows:\nClassification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nAssets:\nOperating lease assets\nOther assets\n$\n25,144\n$\n19,370\nFinance lease assets\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n5,474\nTotal lease assets\n30,618\n20,151\nCurrent liabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities\nAccrued liabilities\n4,587\n5,260\nFinance lease liabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\nNoncurrent liabilities:\nOperating lease liabilities\nOther liabilities\n21,443\n14,770\nFinance lease liabilities\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n4,405\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n31,291\n$\n21,233\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Woodward determined that the approved plan to divest of the renewable power systems business and other related businesses (as described more fully in Note 10, Acquisitions and Divestitures, and defined therein as the disposal group) represented a triggering event requiring the long-lived assets attributable to the disposal group be assessed for impairment. Given the facts and circumstances at that time, Woodward determined that the remaining value of the ROU assets of the disposal group were not recoverable, and a $639 non-cash impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nSupplemental lease-related information follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases\n8.3 years\n4.3 years\nFinance leases\n9.7 years\n1.7 years\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases\n3.6\n%\n3.2\n%\nFinance leases\n3.4\n%\n2.8\n%\nLease-related expenses were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nOperating lease expense\n$\n6,335\n$\n6,559\n$\n6,164\nAmortization of financing lease assets\nInterest on financing lease liabilities\nVariable lease expense\n1,495\n1,101\nShort-term lease expense\nSublease income1\n(192\n)\n(680\n)\n(697\n)\nTotal lease expense\n$\n7,767\n$\n8,140\n$\n7,597\n(1)\nRelates to two separate subleases Woodward has entered into for a leased manufacturing building in Niles, Illinois.

The specific manufacturing contracts that met the criteria were those that utilized Woodward property, plant and equipment and which is substantially (more than 90%) dedicated to the manufacturing of the product(s) for a single customer. Woodward has dedicated manufacturing lines with four of its customers representing embedded leases, all of which qualified as operating leases with undefined quantities of future customer purchase commitments.\nAlthough Woodward expects to allocate some portion of future net sales to these customers to embedded lessor arrangements, it cannot provide expected future undiscounted lease payments from property, plant and equipment leased to customers as of September 30, 2022. If, in the future, customers reduce purchases of related products from Woodward, the Company believes it will derive additional value from the underlying equipment by repurposing its use to support other customer arrangements.\nWoodward recognizes revenue from the embedded lessor arrangements based on the value of the underlying dedicated property, plant, and equipment. There are no fixed payments that the customers under the embedded lessor arrangements are obligated to pay. Therefore, all the customer payments under the embedded lessor arrangements are considered variable with the associated leasing revenue recognized when the revenue from underlying product sale related to variable lease payment is recognized. Revenue from contracts with customers that included embedded operating leases, which is included in Net sales at the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, was $5,528 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $6,305 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe carrying amount of property, plant and equipment leased to others through embedded leasing arrangements, included in Property, plant and equipment, net at the Consolidated Balance Sheets, follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nProperty, plant and equipment leased to others through embedded leasing arrangements\n$\n44,912\n$\n93,732\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(25,508\n)\n(35,733\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment leased to others through embedded leasing arrangements, net\n$\n19,404\n$\n57,999\nNote 6. Joint venture\nIn fiscal year 2016, Woodward and GE, acting through its GE Aviation business unit, consummated the formation of a strategic joint venture between Woodward and GE (the JV) to develop, manufacture and support fuel systems for specified existing and all future GE commercial aircraft engines that produce thrust in excess of fifty thousand pounds.\nUnamortized deferred revenue from material rights in connection with the JV formation included:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nAccrued liabilities\n$\n5,754\n$\n4,771\nOther liabilities\n234,516\n234,237\nAmortization of the deferred revenue (material right) recognized as an increase to sales was $3,633 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, $4,191 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and $5,493 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nWoodward and GE jointly manage the JV and any significant decisions and/or actions of the JV require the mutual consent of both parties. Neither Woodward nor GE has a controlling financial interest in the JV, but both Woodward and GE do have the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial decisions of the JV. Therefore, Woodward is accounting for its 50% ownership interest in the JV using the equity method of accounting. The JV is a related party to Woodward. In addition, GE will continue to pay contingent consideration to Woodward consisting of fifteen annual payments of $4,894 each, which began on January 4, 2017, subject to certain claw-back conditions. Woodward received its fifth and six annual payments of $4,894 during the three-months ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, respectively, which were recorded as deferred income and included in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Neither Woodward nor GE contributed any tangible assets to the JV.\nOther income related to Woodwards equity interest in the earnings of the JV was as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\nOther income\n$\n18,193\n$\n11,366\n$\n15,580\nCash distributions to Woodward from the JV, recognized in Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, from the JV include:\nYear Ended September 30,\nCash distributions\n$\n17,000\n$\n13,500\n$\n14,000\nNet sales to the JV were as follows:\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\nNet sales1\n$\n28,100\n$\n35,957\n$\n48,222\n(1)\nNet sales include a reduction of $28,054 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, $21,101 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, and $23,904 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 related to royalties owed to the JV by Woodward on sales by Woodward directly to third party aftermarket customers.\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets include Accounts receivable related to amounts the JV owed Woodward, Accounts payable related to amounts Woodward owed the JV, and Other assets related to Woodwards net investment in the JV, as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nAccounts receivable\n$\n4,172\n$\n3,639\nAccounts payable\n4,069\n2,823\nOther assets\n8,181\n6,988\nWoodward records in Other liabilities amounts invoiced to the JV for support of the JVs engineering and development projects as an increase to contract liabilities, and records in Other assets related incurred expenditures as costs to fulfill a contract. Woodwards contract liabilities classified as Other liabilities included amounts invoiced to the JV as of September 30, 2022 of $79,257 compared to $73,657 as of fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. Woodwards costs to fulfill a contract included in Other assets related to JV activities were $79,257 as of September 30, 2022 and $73,657 as of fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, Woodward recognized a $1,146 reduction in the contract liability in Other liabilities and a $1,146 reduction in costs to fulfill a contract in Other assets related to the recognition of revenue and cost of goods sold that was included in the contract liability and contract asset, respectively, at the beginning of the fiscal year. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, Woodward recognized a $2,072 reduction in the contract liability in Other liabilities and a $2,072 reduction in costs to fulfill a contract in Other assets related to the termination of a JV engineering and development project previously recognized as a material right. No reductions in costs to fulfill a contract or contract liabilities were recorded during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 as a result of the termination of joint venture engineering and development projects.\nNote 7. Financial instruments and fair value measurements\nThe table below presents information about Woodwards financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques Woodward utilized to determine such fair value.\nAt September 30, 2022\nAt September 30, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nFinancial assets:\nInvestments in term deposits with foreign banks\n$\n37,605\n-\n-\n$\n37,605\n$\n13,187\n-\n-\n$\n13,187\nEquity securities\n22,800\n-\n-\n22,800\n29,714\n-\n-\n29,714\nCross currency interest rate swaps\n-\n38,168\n-\n38,168\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal financial assets\n$\n60,405\n$\n38,168\n$\n-\n$\n98,573\n$\n42,901\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n42,901\nFinancial liabilities:\nCross currency interest rate swaps\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n50,185\n$\n-\n$\n50,185\nTotal financial liabilities\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n50,185\n$\n-\n$\n50,185\nInvestments in term deposits with foreign banks: Woodwards foreign subsidiaries sometimes invest excess cash in various highly liquid financial instruments that Woodward believes are with creditworthy financial institutions. Such investments are reported in Cash and cash equivalents at fair value, with realized gains from interest income recognized in earnings. The carrying value of Woodwards investments in term deposits with foreign banks are considered equal to the fair value given the highly liquid nature of the investments.\nEquity securities: Woodward holds marketable equity securities, through investments in various mutual funds, related to its deferred compensation program. Based on Woodwards intentions regarding these instruments, marketable equity securities are classified as trading securities. The trading securities are reported at fair value, with realized gains and losses recognized in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The trading securities are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of Woodwards trading securities are based on the quoted market prices for the net asset value of the various mutual funds.\nCross-currency interest rate swaps: Woodward holds cross currency interest rate swaps, which are accounted for at fair value. The swaps in an asset position are included in Other current assets and Other assets, and swaps in a liability position are included in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair values of Woodwards cross currency interest rate swaps are determined using a market approach that is based on observable inputs other than quoted market prices, including contract terms, interest rates, currency rates, and other market factors.\nCash, trade accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings are not remeasured to fair value, as the carrying cost of each approximates its respective fair value.\nThe estimated fair values and carrying costs of other financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nAt September 30, 2022\nAt September 30, 2021\nFair Value\nHierarchy\nLevel\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCarrying\nCost\nEstimated\nFair Value\nCarrying\nCost\nAssets:\nNotes receivable from municipalities\n$\n9,010\n$\n8,992\n$\n11,413\n$\n10,193\nNote receivable from sale of disposal group\n-\n-\n6,288\n6,061\nInvestments in short-term time deposits\n8,026\n7,893\n11,587\n11,580\nLiabilities:\nLong-term debt\n$\n646,696\n$\n712,054\n$\n812,866\n$\n736,706\nIn connection with certain economic incentives related to Woodwards development of a second campus in the greater-Rockford, Illinois area for its Aerospace segment and Woodwards development of a new campus at its corporate headquarters in Fort Collins, Colorado, Woodward received long-term notes from municipalities within the states of Illinois and Colorado. The fair value of the long-term notes was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments received at an interest rate available to the Company at the end of the period for similarly rated municipal notes of similar maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to estimate the fair value of the long-term notes were 3.5% at September 30, 2022 and 1.3% at September 30, 2021.\nIn connection with the sale of the disposal group (See Note 10, Acquisitions and Divestitures), Woodward received a promissory note from the buyer for deferral of a portion of the purchase price. The full amount of the promissory note was received during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nFrom time to time, certain of Woodwards foreign subsidiaries will invest excess cash in short-term time deposits with a fixed maturity date of longer than three months but less than one year from the date of the deposit. Woodward believes that the investments are with creditworthy financial institutions. The fair value of the investments in short-term time deposits was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments to be received at an interest rate available to the foreign subsidiary entering into the investment for similar short-term time deposits of similar maturity. This was determined to be a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The interest rates used to estimate the fair value of the short-term time deposits was 6.1% at September 30, 2022 and 3.3% at September 30, 2021.\nThe fair value of long-term debt was estimated based on a model that discounted future principal and interest payments at interest rates available to the Company at the end of the period for similar debt of the same maturity, which is a level 2 input as defined by the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy. The weighted-average interest rates used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt were 5.6% at September 30, 2022 and 1.6% at September 30, 2021.\nNote 8. Derivative instruments and hedging activities\nDerivative instruments not designated or qualifying as hedging instruments\nIn May 2018, Woodward entered into cross currency interest rate swap agreements that synthetically converted $167,420 of floating-rate debt under Woodwards then existing revolving credit agreement to Euro denominated floating-rate debt in conjunction with the LOrange acquisition (the Floating-Rate Cross Currency Swap). Also, in May 2018, Woodward entered into cross currency interest rate swap agreements that synthetically converted an aggregate principal amount of $400,000 of fixed-rate debt associated with the 2018 Note Purchase Agreement (as defined in Note 15, Credit facilities short-term borrowings and long-term debt) to Euro denominated fixed-rate debt (the Fixed-Rate Cross Currency Swaps). The cross-currency interest rate swaps, which effectively reduce the interest rate on the underlying fixed and floating-rate debt under the 2018 Notes (as defined in Note 15, Credit facilities short-term borrowings and long-term debt) and Woodwards then existing revolving credit agreement, respectively, is recorded as a reduction to Interest expense in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nIn May 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties in future cash flows, Woodward terminated the Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps. At the date of settlement, the total notional value of the Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps was $108,823 and $400,000, respectively. Woodward received net cash proceeds of $59,571, which includes $58,191 related to the fair value of the\nderivative assets and $4,380 of net accrued interest, less payment of $3,000 for fees to terminate the swap agreements. The proceeds received for the fair value of the instruments is recorded in Other, while net accrued interest is recorded in Other and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in cash flows provided by operating activities of Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The fees to terminate the swap agreements were expensed as incurred and presented in the line item Selling, general and administrative expenses in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nUpon termination and settlement of the instruments, Woodward entered into a new floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap (the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap), with a notional value of $45,000, and five fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swap agreements (the 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps), with an aggregate notional value of $400,000, which effectively reduce the interest rates on the underlying fixed and floating-rate debt under the 2018 Notes and Woodwards existing revolving credit agreement, respectively. The net interest income of the cross-currency interest rate swaps is recorded as a reduction to Interest expense in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of September 30, 2022, the total notional value of the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps was $11,250 and $400,000, respectively. See Note 7, Financial Instruments and fair value measurements, for the related fair value of the derivative instruments as of September 30, 2022.\nDerivatives instruments in fair value hedging relationships\nConcurrent with the entry into the Floating-Rate Cross Currency Swap in May 2018, a corresponding Euro denominated intercompany loan receivable with identical terms and notional amount as the underlying Euro denominated floating-rate debt, with a reciprocal cross currency interest rate swap, was entered into by Woodward Barbados Financing SRL (Barbados), a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward, and is designated as a fair value hedge under the criteria prescribed in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The objective of the derivative instrument is to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk attributable to the spot remeasurement of the Euro denominated intercompany loan.\nIn May 2020, Woodward settled the Euro denominated intercompany loan receivable with identical terms and notional value to the Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and reciprocal intercompany cross-currency interest rate swap. The fair value hedge designated on these instruments was discontinued at the date of settlement and resulted in a reclassification of $1,719 of previously unrecognized losses from accumulated OCI into earnings. The loss on discontinuation of the fair value hedging relationship is recognized in Gain on cross-currency interest rate swaps, net in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Concurrent with settlement of the Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and discontinuation of the previous fair value hedging relationship, a US dollar denominated intercompany loan payable with identical terms and notional value as the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap, together with a reciprocal intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap, was entered into by Woodward Barbados Euro Financing SRL (Euro Barbados), a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward. The US dollar denominated intercompany loan and reciprocal intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap is designated as a fair value hedge under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objective of the derivative instrument is to hedge against the foreign currency exchange risk attributable to the spot remeasurement of the US dollar denominated intercompany loan, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro functional currency.\nFor each floating-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swap, only the change in the fair value related to the cross-currency basis spread, or excluded component, of the derivative instrument is recognized in accumulated OCI. The remaining change in the fair value of the derivative instrument is recognized in foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in Selling, general and administrative costs in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The change in the fair value of the derivative instrument in foreign currency transaction gain or loss offsets the change in the spot remeasurement of the intercompany Euro and US dollar denominated loans. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the fair value changes of the derivative instrument, after excluding any fair value changes related to the cross-currency basis spread. The initial cost of the cross-currency basis spread is recorded in earnings each period through the swap accrual process. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with the intercompany floating-rate cross-currency interest rate swap.\nDerivative instruments in cash flow hedging relationships\nIn conjunction with the entry into the Fixed-Rate Cross Currency Swaps in May 2018, five corresponding intercompany loans receivable, with identical terms and amounts of each tranche of the underlying aggregate principal amount of $400,000 of fixed-rate debt, and reciprocal cross currency interest rate swaps were entered into by Barbados, which are designated as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objective of these derivative instruments is to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to the foreign currency exchange risk of cash flows for future principal and interest payments associated with the Euro denominated intercompany loans over a fifteen-year period.\nIn May 2020, Woodward settled the Euro denominated intercompany loans receivable with identical terms and notional value to the Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps and reciprocal cross-currency interest rate swaps. The cash flow hedges designated on these instruments were discontinued at the date of settlement and resulted in a reclassification of $32,200 of previously unrecognized gains from accumulated OCI into earnings. The gain on discontinuation of the cash flow hedging relationships is recognized in Gain on cross-currency interest rate swaps, net in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Concurrent with settlement of the Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps and the discontinuation of the previous cash flow hedging relationships, five corresponding US dollar intercompany loans payable, with identical terms and notional values of each tranche of the 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, together with reciprocal fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps were entered into by Euro Barbados, which are designated as cash flow hedges under the criteria prescribed in ASC 815. The objective of these derivative instruments is to hedge the risk of variability in cash flows attributable to the foreign currency exchange risk of cash flows for future principal and interest payments associated with the US dollar denominated intercompany loans over a thirteen-year period, as Euro Barbados maintains a Euro functional currency.\nFor each of the fixed-rate intercompany cross-currency interest rate swaps, changes in the fair values of the derivative instruments are recognized in accumulated OCI and reclassified to foreign currency transaction gain or loss included in Selling, general and administrative costs in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Reclassifications out of accumulated OCI of the change in fair value occur each reporting period based upon changes in the spot rate remeasurement of the Euro and US dollar denominated intercompany loans, including associated interest. Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the fair value changes of the derivative instruments and such hedges are deemed to be highly effective in offsetting exposure to variability in foreign exchange rates. There are no credit-risk-related contingent features associated with these fixed-rate cross-currency interest rate swaps.\nDerivatives instruments in net investment hedging relationships\nOn September 23, 2016, Woodward and Woodward International Holding B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward organized under the laws of The Netherlands (the BV Subsidiary), each entered into a note purchase agreement (the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) relating to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions. Woodward issued \u20ac40,000 aggregate principal amount of Woodwards Series M Senior Notes due September 23, 2026 (the Series M Notes). Woodward designated the Series M Notes as a hedge of a foreign currency exposure of Woodwards net investment in its Euro denominated functional currency subsidiaries. Related to the Series M Notes, included in foreign currency translation adjustments within total comprehensive (losses) earnings are net foreign exchange gains of $7,206 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, compared to net foreign exchanges gains of $592 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 and net foreign exchange losses of $3,199 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nImpact of derivative instruments designated as qualifying hedging instruments\nThe following table discloses the amount of (income) expense recognized in earnings on derivative instruments designated as qualifying hedging instruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDerivatives in:\nLocation\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair value hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n(2,844\n)\n$\n$\n4,592\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n(66,036\n)\n(3,725\n)\n(3,190\n)\nTreasury lock agreement designated as cash flow hedge\nInterest expense\n-\n-\n(72\n)\n$\n(68,880\n)\n$\n(3,702\n)\n$\n1,330\nThe following table discloses the amount of (gain) loss recognized in accumulated OCI on derivative instruments designated as qualifying hedging instruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDerivatives in:\nLocation\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair value hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n(2,854\n)\n$\n$\n4,832\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n(86,194\n)\n1,612\n13,430\n$\n(89,048\n)\n$\n1,672\n$\n18,262\nThe following table discloses the amount of (gain) loss reclassified in accumulated OCI on derivative instruments designated as qualifying hedging instruments:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDerivatives in:\nLocation\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreement designated as fair value hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n(2,844\n)\n$\n$\n5,396\nCross-currency interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n(66,036\n)\n(3,725\n)\n(3,190\n)\nTreasury lock agreement designated as cash flow hedge\nInterest expense\n-\n-\n(72\n)\n$\n(68,880\n)\n$\n(3,702\n)\n$\n2,134\nThe remaining unrecognized gains and losses in Woodwards Consolidated Balance Sheets associated with derivative instruments that were previously entered into by Woodward, which are classified in accumulated OCI were net losses of $6,338 as of September 30, 2022 and $26,506 as of September 30, 2021.\nNote 9.

Acquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nOn August 2, 2022, we entered into a series of Purchase Agreements with one of our Asia pacific channel partners, PM Control PLC (the PM Agreements). Pursuant to the PM Agreements, we agreed to acquire business assets and shares of stock of PM Control PLC and its affiliates (collectively, PM Control), for a total consideration (excluding cash acquired from the acquisition and including the settlement of pre-existing relationships) of $22,299 (the PM Acquisition). The PM Acquisition closed on August 31, 2022 (the PM Closing) and PM Control PLC became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), provides a framework to account for acquisition transactions under U.S. GAAP. The purchase price of PM Control, prepared consistent with the required ASC 805 framework, is allocated as follows:\nCash paid to Sellers\n$\n22,890\nLess acquired cash and restricted cash\n(1,341\n)\nPlus settlement of pre-existing relationships\nTotal purchase price\n$\n22,299\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recorded as of the end of business on August 31, 2022 using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, while transaction costs associated with the acquisition were expensed as incurred. Woodwards allocation was based on an evaluation of the appropriate fair values and represents managements best estimate.\nThe following table summarizes, as of August 31, 2022, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the PM Closing.\nAccounts receivable\n$\n4,334\nInventories\n2,464\nOther current assets\nProperty, plant, and equipment\n2,488\nGoodwill\n8,526\nIntangible assets\n9,916\nTotal assets acquired\n28,114\nOther current liabilities\n(2,688\n)\nDeferred income tax liabilities\n(1,842\n)\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n(1,285\n)\nTotal liabilities assumed\n(5,815\n)\nNet assets acquired\n$\n22,299\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation resulted in the recognition of $8,526 of goodwill, which is expected to be non-deductible for tax purposes. The Company has included all the goodwill in its Industrial segment. The goodwill represents the estimated value of potential expansion with new customers, the opportunity to further develop sales opportunities with new customers, other synergies expected to be achieved through the integration of PM Control with Woodwards Industrial segment.\nA summary of the intangible assets acquired, weighted-average useful lives, and amortization methods follows:\nEstimated\nAmounts\nWeighted-\nAverage\nUseful Life\nAmortization\nMethod\nIntangible assets with finite lives:\nCustomer relationships and contracts\n$\n8,332\n11 years\nStraight-line\nTrade name\n1,584\n5 years\nStraight-line\nTotal\n$\n9,916\nFuture amortization expense associated with the acquired intangibles as of September 30, 2022, is expected to be $1,074 for the next five years ended.\nDue to the timing of the acquisition, we are still finalizing valuations of intangible assets and related tax impacts. The final determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities will be completed within the one-year measurement period as permitted by ASC 805.\nWe have not presented pro forma results because the PM Acquisition was not deemed significant at the date of PM Closing.\nDivestitures\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Woodwards board of directors (the Board) approved a plan to divest Woodwards renewable power systems business, protective relays business, and other businesses within the Companys Industrial segment (collectively, the disposal group).\nWoodward determined that the approved plan to divest the disposal group represented a triggering event requiring (i) the net assets of the disposal group to be classified as held for sale and (ii) the long-lived assets attributable to the disposal group be assessed for impairment. Given the facts and circumstances at that time, Woodward determined that the value of the long-lived assets of the disposal group, including goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets and property, plant, and equipment, were not recoverable and a $22,900 non-cash impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The non-cash impairment charge removed all the goodwill, intangible assets, ROU assets and\nproperty, plant, and equipment associated with the disposal group from the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of June 30, 2020.\nFurther, on the approval of the divestiture plan and subsequent marketing of the disposal group, Woodward determined that based on the current market conditions, the carrying value of the disposal groups remaining held for sale net assets exceeded the fair value. As a result, Woodward recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the net assets of the disposal group to their fair value. The non-cash impairment charge associated with the long-lived assets, and related valuation allowance for the other remaining net assets attributable to the disposal group, resulted in a total impairment charge of $37,902.\nIn determining the amount by which the carrying value of the disposal groups remaining net assets exceeded their fair value, Woodward considered primarily the market value of the assets held for sale based on negotiations it had entered into with affiliates of the AURELIUS Group for the sale of the majority of the disposal group. On January 31, 2020, Woodward entered into a definitive agreement to sell the majority of the disposal group to affiliates of the AURELIUS Group for $23,400, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, consisting of cash and a $6,000 promissory note, which was due by April 30, 2022. The assets were primarily located in Germany, Poland and Bulgaria and accounted for approximately $88,000 of sales in fiscal year 2019. The valuation reserve recorded to reduce the carrying value of the net assets held for sale was based on the estimated selling price pursuant to the definitive agreement reduced by the estimated working capital adjustments, transaction costs, and anticipated losses on assets held for sale that were not included in the disposal group to be sold to the AURELIUS Group.\nThe transactions consummating the sale of the disposal group were completed on April 30, 2020.

On December 30, 2019, the Company closed on the sale of one of two parcels of real property at the Duarte facility and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of assets of $13,522. On August 11, 2020, the Company closed on the sale of the final parcel of real property at the Duarte facility and recorded a pre-tax gain on sale of assets of $8,801.\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Woodward determined that the approved plan to divest of the disposal group (see Note 10, Acquisitions and Divestitures) represented a triggering event requiring the long-lived assets attributable to the disposal group be assessed for impairment. Given the facts and circumstances at that time, Woodward determined that the remaining value of the plant, property and equipment of the disposal group was not recoverable, and a $13,421 non-cash impairment charge was recorded during fiscal year 2020.\nOn September 25, 2020, the Company closed on the sale of its Loveland, Colorado campus with a concurrent purchase of a new property in Windsor, Colorado for future operations, resulting in recognition of a pre-tax gain on sale of assets of $2,330.\nFor the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Woodward had depreciation expense as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDepreciation expense\n$\n83,019\n$\n87,631\n$\n91,700\nNote 13.

Given the facts and circumstances at the time, Woodward determined that the remaining value of the goodwill of the disposal group was not recoverable and an $8,640 non-cash impairment charge was recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nWoodward tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or at any time there is an indication goodwill may be impaired, commonly referred to as triggering events. Woodward completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 31, 2022 during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. The fair value of each of Woodwards reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow method. This method represents a level 3 input and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, earnings margins, future tax rates, and the present value, based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of forecasted cash flows. Management projects revenue growth rates, earnings margins and cash flows based on each reporting units current operational results, expected performance and operational strategies over a five-year period. These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products, and require considerable management judgment.\nForecasted cash flows used in the July 31, 2022 impairment test were discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assumptions ranging from 8.93% to 17.43%. The terminal values of the forecasted cash flows were calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after five years of 3.95%. These inputs, which are unobservable in the market, represent managements best estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the Companys forecasted cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows. Woodward evaluated the reasonableness of the reporting units resulting fair values utilizing a market multiple method. The results of Woodwards goodwill impairment test performed as of July 31, 2022 did not indicate impairment of any of Woodwards reporting units.\nNote 14.

The impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset, determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach, with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its fair value. Woodward has not recognized any impairment charges for this asset.\nDuring the fourth quarter, Woodward completed its annual impairment test of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset as of July 31, 2022 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. The fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible assets was determined using discounted cash flows based on the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method represents a Level 3 input (based upon a fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP) and incorporates various estimates and assumptions, the most significant being projected revenue growth rates, royalty rates, future tax rates and the present value, based on an estimated weighted-average cost of capital (or the discount rate) and terminal growth rate, of the forecasted cash flow. Management projects revenue growth rates and cash flows based on Woodward LOranges current operational results, expected performance and operational strategies over a five year period. These projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products, and require considerable management judgment.\nThe forecasted cash flow used in the July 31, 2022 impairment test was discounted using weighted-average cost of capital assumption of 9.70%. The terminal value of the forecasted cash flow was calculated using the Gordon Growth Model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after five years of 3.95%. These inputs, which are unobservable in the market, represent managements best estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the Companys forecasted cash flows. Changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of the forecasted cash flow. The results of impairment test performed as of July 31, 2022 indicated the estimated fair value of the Woodward LOrange trade name intangible asset was in excess of its carrying value, and accordingly, no impairment existed.\nFinite-lived intangible assets\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, Woodward determined that the approved plan to divest of the disposal group represented a triggering event requiring the long-lived assets attributable to the disposal group be assessed for impairment. Given the facts and circumstances at that time, Woodward determined that the remaining value of the intangible assets of the disposal group was not recoverable and a $200 non-cash impairment charge was recorded for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.\nWoodward recorded amortization expense associated with intangibles of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAmortization expense\n$\n37,609\n$\n41,893\n$\n39,458\nFuture amortization expense associated with intangibles is expected to be:\nYear Ending September 30:\n$\n35,885\n32,014\n26,852\n26,816\n26,750\nThereafter\n255,425\n$\n403,742\nNote 15.

Pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, the lenders party thereto have agreed to extend revolving loans and letters of credit to Woodward and certain of its foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1,000,000. The Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement provides for the option to increase available borrowings up to $1,500,000, in the aggregate, subject to lenders participation.\nAs of October 1, 2021, Woodward maintained a revolving credit agreement dated as of June 19, 2019 (the 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement). On November 24, 2021, Woodward amended the 2019 Revolving Credit Agreement (such amended agreement, the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement) to, among other things, (i) replace the Euro London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the British pound sterling LIBOR, and the Japanese yen LIBOR rates with the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor), Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA), and Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (TIBOR) rates, respectively, and (ii) replace the US LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement was set to mature on June 19, 2024. As of September 30, 2022, there were $66,800 in principal amount of borrowings outstanding, at an effective interest rate of 4.24% under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2022, all of borrowings outstanding were classified as short-term borrowings based on Woodwards intent and ability to pay this amount in the next twelve months. As of September 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding.\nOn October 21, 2022, Woodward amended and restated the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement). Effective as of October 21, 2022, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, extended the termination date of the revolving loan commitments of all the lenders from June 19, 2024 to October 21, 2027; removed the covenants restricting investments, acquisitions, dividends and distributions; and, subject to removal from the Companys existing note purchase agreements or the termination or maturation of such note purchase agreements, removed the minimum consolidated net worth covenant. Borrowings under the Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement could, and borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement can, be made by Woodward and certain of its foreign subsidiaries in U.S. dollars or in foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar and generally bear interest at the new base rates listed above plus 0.875% to 1.75%.\nThe revolving credit agreements described in this Note 15 all contain (or contained, as applicable) certain covenants customary with such agreements, which are generally consistent with the covenants applicable to Woodwards long-term debt agreements, and contains customary events of default, including certain cross default provisions related to Woodwards other outstanding material debt arrangements, the occurrence of which would permit the lenders to accelerate the amounts due thereunder. In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes the following financial covenants: (i) a maximum permitted leverage ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, stock-based compensation, and amortization, plus any usual non-cash charges to the extent deducted in computing net income and transaction costs associated with permitted acquisitions (incurred within six-months of the permitted acquisition), minus any usual non-cash gains to the extent added in computing net income (Leverage Ratio) for Woodward and its consolidated subsidiaries of 3.5 to 1.0, which ratio, subject to certain restrictions, may increase to 4.0 to 1.0 for each period of four consecutive quarters during which a permitted acquisition occurs, and (ii) a minimum consolidated net worth of $1,156,000 plus (a) 50% of Woodwards positive net income for the prior fiscal year and (b) 50% of Woodwards net cash proceeds resulting from certain issuances of stock, subject to certain adjustments.\nThe obligations of Woodward and from time-to-time certain of Woodwards foreign subsidiaries, under the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Woodward MPC, Inc., Woodward HRT, Inc., or in case of obligations with any foreign subsidiaries of Woodward that are borrowers thereunder, Woodward LOrange GmbH, each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward.\nShort-term borrowings\nWoodward has other foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities at various financial institutions, which are generally reviewed annually for renewal and are subject to the usual terms and conditions applied by the financial institutions. Pursuant to the terms of the related facility agreements, Woodwards foreign performance guarantee facilities are limited in use to providing performance guarantees to third parties. There were no borrowings outstanding on Woodwards foreign lines of credit and foreign overdraft facilities as of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nLong-term debt\nSeptember 30, 2022\nSeptember 30, 2021\nSeries H notes - 4.03%, due November 15, 2023; unsecured\n$\n25,000\n$\n25,000\nSeries I notes - 4.18%, due November 15, 2025; unsecured\n25,000\n25,000\nSeries K notes - 4.03%, due November 15, 2023; unsecured\n50,000\n50,000\nSeries L notes - 4.18%, due November 15, 2025; unsecured\n50,000\n50,000\nSeries M notes - 1.12% due September 23, 2026; unsecured\n39,198\n46,376\nSeries N notes - 1.31% due September 23, 2028; unsecured\n75,457\n89,273\nSeries O notes - 1.57% due September 23, 2031; unsecured\n42,138\n49,854\nSeries P notes - 4.27% due May 30, 2025; unsecured\n85,000\n85,000\nSeries Q notes - 4.35% due May 30, 2027; unsecured\n85,000\n85,000\nSeries R notes - 4.41% due May 30, 2029; unsecured\n75,000\n75,000\nSeries S notes - 4.46% due May 30, 2030; unsecured\n75,000\n75,000\nSeries T notes - 4.61% due May 30, 2033; unsecured\n80,000\n80,000\nFinance leases (Note 5)\n5,261\n1,203\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(1,438\n)\n(1,856\n)\nTotal long-term debt\n710,616\n734,850\nLess: Current portion of long-term debt\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n$\n709,760\n$\n734,122\nThe Notes\nOn September 23, 2016, Woodward and the BV Subsidiary each entered into note purchase agreements (the 2016 Note Purchase Agreements) relating to the sale by Woodward and the BV Subsidiary of an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac160,000 of senior unsecured notes in a series of private placement transactions. Woodward issued \u20ac40,000 Series M Notes. The BV Subsidiary issued (a) \u20ac77,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiarys Series N Senior Notes (the Series N Notes) and (b) \u20ac43,000 aggregate principal amount of the BV Subsidiarys Series O Senior Notes (the Series O Notes and together with the Series M Notes and the Series N Notes, the 2016 Notes).\nOn May 31, 2018, Woodward entered into a note purchase agreement (the 2018 Note Purchase Agreement) relating to the sale by Woodward of an aggregate principal amount of $400,000 of senior unsecured notes comprised of (a) $85,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series P Senior Notes (the Series P Notes), (b) $85,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series Q Senior Notes (the Series Q Notes), (c) $75,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series R Senior Notes (the Series R Notes), (d) $75,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series S Senior Notes (the Series S Notes), and (e) $80,000 aggregate principal amount of its Series T Senior Notes (the Series T Notes, and together with the Series P Notes, the Series Q Notes, the Series R Notes, and the Series S Notes, the 2018 Notes, and, together with the USD Notes and 2016 Notes, the Notes), in a series of private placement transactions.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes, the Company entered into cross currency swap transactions in respect of each tranche of the 2018 Notes, which effectively reduced the interest rates on the Series P Notes to 1.82% per annum, the Series Q Notes to 2.15% per annum, the Series R Notes to 2.42% per annum, the Series S Notes to 2.55% per annum and the Series T Notes to 2.90% per annum. Following the termination and settlement of the Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps entered into in 2018, the Company entered into the 2020 Floating-Rate Cross-Currency Swap and 2020 Fixed-Rate Cross-Currency Swaps, which effectively resulted in the interest rates on the Series P Notes being 3.44% per annum, the Series Q Notes to 3.44% per annum, the Series R Notes to 3.45% per annum, the\nSeries S Notes to 3.50% per annum and the Series T Notes to 3.62% per annum (see Note 8, Derivative instruments and hedging activities).\nInterest on the remaining First Closing Notes, and the Series K and L Notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year until all principal is paid. Interest on the 2016 Notes is payable semi-annually on March 23 and September 23 of each year, until all principal is paid.\nNone of the Notes were registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and they may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements. Holders of the Notes do not have any registration rights. All of the issued Notes are held by multiple institutions.\nWoodwards payment and performance obligations under the Notes, including without limitation the obligations for payment of all principal, interest and any applicable prepayment compensation amount, are guaranteed by (i) Woodward FST, Inc., Woodward MPC, Inc., and Woodward HRT, Inc., each of which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Woodward, and (ii) in the case of the BV Subsidiarys Series N and O Notes, by Woodward. Woodwards obligations under the Notes rank equal in right of payment with all of Woodwards other unsecured unsubordinated debt, including its outstanding debt under its revolving credit facility.\nThe Notes contain restrictive covenants customary for such financings, including, among other things, covenants that place limits on Woodwards ability to incur liens on assets, incur additional debt (including a leverage or coverage-based maintenance test), transfer or sell Woodwards assets, merge or consolidate with other persons and enter into material transactions with affiliates. Under the financial covenants contained in the note purchase agreement governing each series of the Notes, Woodwards priority debt may not exceed, at any time, 25% of its consolidated net worth. Woodwards Leverage Ratio cannot exceed 4.0 to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, or 3.5 to 1.0 at any other time on a rolling four quarter basis. In the event that Woodwards Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.5 to 1.0 during any material acquisition period, the interest rate on each series of Notes will increase. The minimum consolidated net worth, prior year positive net income, and net cash proceeds resulting from certain issuances of stock for satisfaction of Woodwards leverage ratio are consistent between the Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nRequired future principal payments of the Notes as of September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nYear Ending September 30:\n$\n-\n75,000\n85,000\n114,198\n85,000\nThereafter\n347,595\n$\n706,793\nCertain financial and other covenants under Woodwards debt agreements contain customary restrictions on the operation of its business. Management believes that Woodward was in compliance with the covenants under the long-term debt agreements at September 30, 2022.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nAmounts recognized as interest expense from the amortization of debt issuance costs were $917 in fiscal year 2022, $922 in fiscal year 2021, and $892 in fiscal year 2020. Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the Notes of $1,438 as of September 30, 2022 and $1,856 as of September 30, 2021 were recorded as a reduction in Long-term debt, less current portion in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unamortized debt issuance costs associated with Woodwards Revolving Credit Agreements of $1,046 as of September 30, 2022 and $1,644 as of September 30, 2021 were recorded as Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amortization of debt issuance costs is included in operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNote 16.

In connection with leadership changes arising from such reorganization, we recorded $1,083 of restructuring charges as nonsegment expenses, the majority of which are expected to be paid within twelve months.\nIn fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded aggregate restructuring charges totaling $5,008 as nonsegment expenses for two separate workforce management actions, one in our hydraulics systems business and one in our engine systems business. In fiscal year 2022, we experienced a challenging operating environment that included the ongoing impact of global supply chain and labor disruptions, along with high inflation, which resulted in changed business conditions as compared to when we initially recorded the restructuring charges in fiscal year 2021. We adapted to the changed business conditions by, among other initiatives, (i) developing and implementing plans to insource select machined components, (ii) redeploying talent and adding indirect resources to our factories to stabilize the production environment, and (iii) determining to retain employees that otherwise would have been impacted by the planned restructuring activities to support a stable workforce and effectively manage through attrition. As such, the remaining unpaid accrued restructuring charges, which amounted to $4,503, were no longer needed and were reversed.\nIn fiscal year 2020, the Company committed to a plan of termination (the COVID-19 Termination Plan), as well as other cost savings actions, in response to the ongoing global economic challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Companys business. The COVID-19 Termination Plan involved the termination and/or furlough of employees and contractors at certain of the Companys operating facilities, primarily in the United States. As a result of the COVID-19 Termination Plan and other related actions, the Company incurred $23,673 of restructuring charges for employee severance and benefits costs as of September 30, 2020, with the majority of the cash expenditures being paid by September 30, 2020. All of the restructuring charges recorded during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 were (i) recorded as nonsegment expenses and (ii) were paid or reversed, as appropriate, as of September 30, 2021.\nThe summary of activity in accrued restructuring charges during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 is as follows:\nPeriod Activity\nBalances\nas of\nSeptember 30,\nCharges\nPayments\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\nNon-cash\nactivity\nBalances\nas of\nSeptember 30,\nWorkforce management costs associated with:\nHydraulics Systems Realignment\n$\n3,758\n$\n-\n$\n(505\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(3,253\n)\n$\n-\nEngine Systems Realignment\n1,250\n-\n-\n-\n(1,250\n)\n-\nAerospace\n-\n-\n-\n-\nIndustrial\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n5,008\n$\n1,083\n$\n(505\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(4,503\n)\n$\n1,083\nPeriod Activity\nBalances\nas of\nSeptember 30,\nCharges\nPayments\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\nNon-cash\nactivity\nBalances\nas of\nSeptember 30,\nWorkforce management costs associated with:\nHydraulics Systems Realignment\n$\n-\n$\n3,758\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n3,758\nEngine Systems Realignment\n-\n1,250\n-\n-\n-\n1,250\nCOVID-19 pandemic\n3,395\n-\n(2,409\n)\n(1,166\n)\n-\nTotal\n$\n3,395\n$\n5,008\n$\n(2,409\n)\n$\n$\n(1,166\n)\n$\n5,008\nNote 17.

The majority of the NOL carryforwards as of September 30, 2022 expire at various times beginning in fiscal years 2023 through 2029.\nWoodward has recorded tax credits and incentives deferred tax assets of $25,623 as of September 30, 2022 and $22,756 as of September 30, 2021. The majority of the tax credit and incentive carryforwards as of September 30, 2022 expire at various times beginning in fiscal year 2023 through 2034.\nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when the realization of the deferred tax asset is less than 50 percent likely. Both positive and negative evidence are considered in forming Woodwards judgment as to whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, and more weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. Valuation allowances are reassessed whenever there are changes in circumstances that may cause a change in judgment.\nThe change in the valuation allowance was primarily the result of releasing a valuation allowance related to certain state tax credit carryforwards that we determined are now more likely than not realizable.\nAt September 30, 2022, Woodward has not provided for taxes on undistributed foreign earnings of $346,000 that it considered indefinitely reinvested. These earnings could become subject to income taxes if they are remitted as dividends, are loaned to Woodward or any of Woodwards subsidiaries located in the United States, or if Woodward sells its stock in the foreign subsidiaries. Any additional U.S. taxes could be offset, in part or in whole, by foreign tax credits. The amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time these amounts are repatriated. Based on these variables, it is impractical to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these funds were to be repatriated.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax 21% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, September 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 to Woodwards effective income tax rate:\nYear Ending September 30,\nPercent of pretax earnings\nStatutory tax rate\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n(2.5\n)\n(0.5\n)\n0.3\nTaxes on international activities\n0.8\n(0.1\n)\n(2.1\n)\nResearch credit\n(4.5\n)\n(3.1\n)\n(3.6\n)\nNet excess income tax benefit from stock-based compensation\n(2.5\n)\n(4.2\n)\n(2.8\n)\nAdjustments of prior period tax items\n-\n0.4\n1.0\nCompensation and benefits\n0.3\n0.5\n0.4\nOther items, net\n1.5\n1.1\n0.5\nEffective tax rate\n14.1\n%\n15.1\n%\n14.7\n%\nIn determining the tax amounts in Woodwards financial statements, estimates are sometimes used that are subsequently adjusted in the actual filing of tax returns or by updated calculations. In addition, Woodward occasionally has resolutions of tax items with tax authorities related to prior years due to the conclusion of audits and the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are included in the Adjustments of prior period tax items line in the above table.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021 is primarily attributable to a partial release of valuation allowance related to state credits and increased Research and Development Credit in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease was partially offset by a smaller stock-based compensation tax benefit in the current fiscal year when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\nBeginning balance\n$\n15,199\n$\n9,851\n$\n10,305\nAdditions to current year tax positions\n1,783\n2,289\n1,890\nReductions to prior year tax positions\n(963\n)\n-\n(2,415\n)\nAdditions to prior year tax positions\n3,166\nLapse of applicable statute of limitations\n(4,193\n)\n(107\n)\n-\nEnding balance\n$\n11,938\n$\n15,199\n$\n9,851\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were $8,092 as of September 30, 2022 and $8,724 as of September 30, 2021 of tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate. At this time, Woodward estimates that it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as $4,203 in the next twelve months due to the completion of review by tax authorities, lapses of statutes, and the settlement of tax positions. Woodward accrues for potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits and all other interest and penalties related to tax payments in tax expense.\nWoodwards tax returns are subject to audits by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities, and these audits are at various stages of completion at any given time. Reviews of tax matters by authorities and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitation may result in changes to tax expense. Woodwards fiscal years remaining open to examination for U.S. Federal income taxes include fiscal years 2019 and thereafter. In fiscal year 2020, Woodward concluded its U.S. Federal income tax examination through fiscal year 2017, which included a foreign tax carryback to fiscal year 2016. Woodwards fiscal years remaining open to examination for significant U.S. state income tax jurisdictions include fiscal years 2018 and thereafter. Woodwards, fiscal years remaining open to examination in significant foreign jurisdictions include 2017 and thereafter.\nNote 20. Retirement benefits\nWoodward provides various retirement benefits to eligible members of the Company, including contributions to various defined contribution plans, pension benefits associated with defined benefit plans, postretirement medical benefits and postretirement life insurance benefits. Eligibility requirements and benefit levels vary depending on employee location.\nDefined contribution plans\nMost of the Companys U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the U.S. defined contribution plan. The U.S. defined contribution plan allows employees to defer part of their annual income for income tax purposes into their personal 401(k) accounts. The Company makes matching contributions to eligible employee accounts, which are also deferred for employee personal income tax purposes. Certain non-U.S. employees are also eligible to participate in similar non-U.S. plans.\nPrior to January 1, 2021 most of Woodwards U.S. employees with at least two years of qualifying service (such two years of service, the Initial Period of Service) received an annual contribution of Woodward stock, generally equal to 5% of their eligible prior year wages, to their personal Woodward Retirement Savings Plan accounts (the Stock Contribution). Effective as of January 1, 2021, the Board amended the Woodward Retirement Savings Plan to eliminate the Initial Period Service for purposes of the Stock Contribution. Eligible U.S. employees are now generally eligible to receive the Stock Contribution if they are employed by the Company on the last day of the applicable calendar year without regard to service time. The first Company Stock Contribution under the amended contribution rules were made during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nIn the second quarters of fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, Woodward fulfilled its annual Woodward stock contribution obligation using shares held in treasury stock by issuing a total of 150 shares of common stock for a value of $17,132 in fiscal year 2022, 128 total shares of common stock for a value of $14,900 in fiscal year 2021, and 124 shares of common stock for a value of $14,748 in fiscal year 2020. The Woodward Retirement Savings Plan (the WRS Plan) held 2,553 shares of Woodward stock as of September 30, 2022 and 2,760 shares as of September 30, 2021. The shares held in the WRS Plan participate in dividends and are considered issued and outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. Accrued liabilities included obligations to contribute shares of Woodward common stock to the WRS Plan in the amount of $14,769 as of September 30, 2022 and $11,588 as of September 30, 2021.\nThe amount of expense associated with defined contribution plans was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nCompany costs\n$\n40,898\n$\n33,717\n$\n33,769\nDefined benefit plans\nWoodward has defined benefit plans that provide pension benefits for certain retired employees in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany. Woodward also provides other postretirement benefits to its employees including postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits. Postretirement medical benefits are provided to certain current and retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States and the United Kingdom. Life insurance benefits are provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans, which are no longer available to current employees. A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for all of Woodwards defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nExcluding the Woodward HRT Plan, which is only partially frozen to salaried participants, the defined benefit plans in the United States were frozen in fiscal year 2007 and no additional employees may participate in the U.S. plans and no additional service costs will be incurred.\nPension Plans\nThe actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations of retirement pension benefits were as follows:\nAt September 30,\nUnited States:\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine benefit obligation:\nDiscount rate\n5.70%\n3.05%\n2.75%\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate\n3.05\n2.75\n3.25\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n5.00\n7.15\n7.39\nThe discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the retirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments.\nIn the United States, Woodward uses a bond portfolio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or better that have at least $50 million outstanding to determine the benefit obligations at year end.\nAt September 30,\nUnited Kingdom:\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine benefit obligation:\nDiscount rate\n5.35%\n2.05%\n1.62%\nRate of compensation increase\n4.00\n3.80\n3.30\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost\n2.15\n1.71\n1.79\nDiscount rate - interest cost\n1.83\n1.41\n1.59\nRate of compensation increase\n4.00\n3.30\n3.50\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n3.80\n4.00\n4.75\nAt September 30,\nJapan:\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine benefit obligation:\nDiscount rate\n1.60%\n0.92%\n1.10\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n2.00\n2.00\n2.00\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost\n1.13\n1.33\n0.72\nDiscount rate - interest cost\n0.65\n0.74\n0.31\nRate of compensation increase\n2.25\n2.00\n2.00\nLong-term rate of return on plan assets\n2.00\n2.00\n2.50\nAt September 30,\nGermany:\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine benefit obligation:\nDiscount rate\n3.97\n%\n1.36\n%\n0.97\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n2.50\n2.50\n2.50\nWeighted-average assumptions to determine periodic benefit costs:\nDiscount rate - service cost\n1.54\n1.11\n1.01\nDiscount rate - interest cost\n1.06\n0.76\n0.56\nRate of compensation increase\n2.50\n2.50\n2.50\nIn the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan, Woodward uses a high-quality corporate bond yield curve matched with separate cash flows to develop a single rate to determine the single rate equivalent to settle the entire benefit obligations in each jurisdiction. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the discount rate used to determine periodic service cost and interest cost components of the overall benefit costs was based on spot rates derived from the same high-quality corporate bond yield curve used to determine the September 30, 2021 and 2020 benefit obligation, respectively, matched with separate cash flows for each future year.\nCompensation increase assumptions, where applicable, are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions.\nIn determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, Woodward assumes that the historical long-term compound growth rates of equity and fixed-income securities will predict the future returns of similar investments in the plan portfolio. Investment management and other fees paid out of the plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions.\nMortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends. The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were based on the Society of Actuaries (SOA) Pri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOAs Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2019 (MP-2019) and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2019 with a 5-year convergence period and a long-term rate of 0.75%.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, mortality assumptions in Japan were based on the Standard rates 2020 and mortality assumptions for the United Kingdom pension scheme were based on the Self-administered pension scheme (SAPS) S3 all tables with a projected 1.5% annual improvement rate. As of September 30, 2022, and September 30, 2021, mortality assumptions in Germany were based on the Heubeck 2018 G mortality tables.\nNet periodic benefit costs consist of the following components reflected as expense in Woodwards Consolidated Statement of Earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States\nOther Countries\nTotal\nService cost\n$\n1,554\n$\n1,729\n$\n1,659\n$\n2,339\n$\n2,922\n$\n2,865\n$\n3,893\n$\n4,651\n$\n4,524\nInterest cost\n5,281\n4,957\n5,590\n1,612\n1,361\n1,278\n6,893\n6,318\n6,868\nExpected return on plan assets\n(10,853\n)\n(14,144\n)\n(12,346\n)\n(2,434\n)\n(2,482\n)\n(2,827\n)\n(13,287\n)\n(16,626\n)\n(15,173\n)\nAmortization of:\nNet losses\n1,430\n1,046\n1,472\n2,476\nNet prior service cost\n1,004\nNet periodic (benefit) cost\n$\n(2,778\n)\n$\n(5,948\n)\n$\n(2,731\n)\n$\n2,095\n$\n2,757\n$\n2,385\n$\n(683\n)\n$\n(3,191\n)\n$\n(346\n)\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the projected benefit obligation and fair value of assets for the defined benefit pension plans:\nAt or for the Year Ended September 30,\nUnited States\nOther Countries\nTotal\nChanges in projected benefit obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n177,346\n$\n184,077\n$\n122,018\n$\n123,546\n$\n299,364\n$\n307,623\nPlan amendment\n-\n-\n-\n-\nService cost\n1,554\n1,729\n2,339\n2,922\n3,893\n4,651\nInterest cost\n5,281\n4,957\n1,612\n1,361\n6,893\n6,318\nNet actuarial losses (gains)\n(43,639\n)\n(6,496\n)\n(40,968\n)\n(3,459\n)\n(84,607\n)\n(9,955\n)\nContribution by participants\n-\n-\nBenefits paid\n(8,098\n)\n(7,532\n)\n(3,487\n)\n(3,782\n)\n(11,585\n)\n(11,314\n)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\n-\n-\n(16,047\n)\n1,420\n(16,047\n)\n1,420\nProjected benefit obligation at end of year\n$\n132,444\n$\n177,346\n$\n65,477\n$\n122,018\n$\n197,921\n$\n299,364\nChanges in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n221,263\n$\n201,555\n$\n69,844\n$\n65,154\n$\n291,107\n$\n266,709\nActual return on plan assets\n(58,684\n)\n27,240\n(9,822\n)\n4,675\n(68,506\n)\n31,915\nContributions by the Company\n-\n-\n2,370\n2,185\n2,370\n2,185\nContributions by plan participants\n-\n-\nBenefits paid\n(8,098\n)\n(7,532\n)\n(3,487\n)\n(3,782\n)\n(11,585\n)\n(11,314\n)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\n-\n-\n(11,336\n)\n1,602\n(11,336\n)\n1,602\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n$\n154,481\n$\n221,263\n$\n47,579\n$\n69,844\n$\n202,060\n$\n291,107\nNet over/(under) funded status at end of year\n$\n22,037\n$\n43,917\n$\n(17,898\n)\n$\n(52,174\n)\n$\n4,139\n$\n(8,257\n)\nAt September 30, 2022, the Companys defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, Japan and Germany represented $30,788, $6,976 and $27,713 of the total projected benefit obligation, respectively. At September 30, 2022, the United Kingdom and Japan pension plan assets represented $39,096 and $8,483 of the total fair value of all plan assets, respectively. The German pension plans are unfunded and have no plan assets.\nThe largest contributor to the net actuarial gains affecting the funded status for the defined benefit pension plans in the United States is due to an increase in the discount rate. The largest contributor to the net actuarial gains affecting the benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, Japan, and Germany is due to an increase in the discount rate.\nThe accumulated benefit obligations of the Companys defined benefit pension plans at September 30, 2022 was $132,444 in the United States, $30,342 in the United Kingdom, $6,432 in Japan, and $27,707 in Germany, and at September 30, 2021 was $177,346 in the United States, $60,690 in the United Kingdom, $8,958 in Japan, and $50,402 in Germany.\nPlans with accumulated\nbenefit obligation in\nexcess of plan assets\nPlans with accumulated\nbenefit obligation less\nthan plan assets\nAt September 30,\nAt September 30,\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n(48,371\n)\n$\n(112,302\n)\n$\n(149,550\n)\n$\n(187,062\n)\nAccumulated benefit obligation\n(48,354\n)\n(111,151\n)\n(148,571\n)\n(186,245\n)\nFair value of plan assets\n18,459\n57,945\n183,601\n233,161\nThe following tables provide the amounts recognized in the statement of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive losses for the defined benefit pension plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States\nOther Countries\nTotal\nAmounts recognized in statement of financial position consist of:\nOther non-current assets\n$\n24,159\n$\n43,917\n$\n9,892\n$\n2,182\n$\n34,051\n$\n46,099\nAccrued liabilities\n-\n-\n(976\n)\n(1,017\n)\n(976\n)\n(1,017\n)\nOther non-current liabilities\n(2,122\n)\n-\n(26,814\n)\n(53,339\n)\n(28,936\n)\n(53,339\n)\nNet over/(under) funded status at end of year\n$\n22,037\n$\n43,917\n$\n(17,898\n)\n$\n(52,174\n)\n$\n4,139\n$\n(8,257\n)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income consist of:\nUnrecognized net prior service cost\n$\n3,475\n$\n4,455\n$\n$\n$\n3,937\n$\n5,039\nUnrecognized net losses (gains)\n14,822\n(10,816\n)\n(5,459\n)\n24,860\n9,363\n14,044\nTotal amounts recognized\n18,297\n(6,361\n)\n(4,997\n)\n25,444\n13,300\n19,083\nDeferred taxes\n(7,801\n)\n(1,691\n)\n(697\n)\n(7,785\n)\n(8,498\n)\n(9,476\n)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income\n$\n10,496\n$\n(8,052\n)\n$\n(5,694\n)\n$\n17,659\n$\n4,802\n$\n9,607\nThe following table reconciles the changes in accumulated other comprehensive losses for the defined benefit pension plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nUnited States\nOther Countries\nTotal\nAccumulated other comprehensive losses at beginning of year\n$\n(6,361\n)\n$\n14,131\n$\n25,444\n$\n31,377\n$\n19,083\n$\n45,508\nNet loss (gain)\n25,898\n(19,593\n)\n(28,712\n)\n(5,832\n)\n(2,814\n)\n(25,425\n)\nPrior service cost due to plan amendment\n-\n-\n-\n-\nAmortization of:\nNet losses\n(259\n)\n(541\n)\n(555\n)\n(931\n)\n(814\n)\n(1,472\n)\nPrior service cost\n(981\n)\n(969\n)\n(23\n)\n(25\n)\n(1,004\n)\n(994\n)\nForeign currency exchange rate changes\n-\n-\n(1,151\n)\n(1,151\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive losses at end of year\n$\n18,297\n$\n(6,361\n)\n$\n(4,997\n)\n$\n25,444\n$\n13,300\n$\n19,083\nPension benefit payments are made from the assets of the pension plans. The German pension plans are unfunded; therefore, benefit payments are made from Company contributions into these plans as required to meet the payment obligations. Using foreign exchange rates as of September 30, 2022 and expected future service assumptions, it is anticipated that the future benefit payments will be as follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\nUnited States\nOther\nCountries\nTotal\n$\n8,839\n$\n3,184\n$\n12,023\n9,310\n3,083\n12,393\n9,673\n3,060\n12,733\n9,967\n3,069\n13,036\n10,235\n3,180\n13,415\n2028 - 2032\n52,807\n19,239\n72,046\nWoodward expects its pension plan contributions in fiscal year 2023 will be $1,044 in the United Kingdom, $134 in Japan and $990 in Germany. Woodward expects to have no pension plan contributions in fiscal year 2023 in the United States.\nPension plan assets\nThe overall investment objective of the pension plan assets is to earn a rate of return over time which, when combined with Company contributions, satisfies the benefit obligations of the pension plans and maintains sufficient liquidity to pay benefits.\nAs the timing and nature of the plan obligations varies for each Company sponsored pension plan, investment strategies have been individually designed for each pension plan with a common focus on maintaining diversified investment portfolios that provide for long-term growth while minimizing the risk to principal associated with short-term market behavior. The strategy for each of the plans balances the requirements to generate returns, using investments expected to produce higher returns, such as equity securities, with the need to control risk within the pension plans using less volatile investment assets, such as debt securities. A strategy of more equity-oriented allocation is adopted for those plans which have a longer-term investment plan based on the timing of the associated benefit obligations.\nRisks associated with the plan assets include interest rate fluctuation risk, market fluctuation risk, risk of default by debt issuers and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the assets are managed by established, professional investment firms and performance is evaluated regularly by the Companys pension oversight committee against specific benchmarks and each plans investment objectives. Liability management and asset class diversification are central to the Companys risk management approach and overall investment strategy.\nThe assets of the U.S. plans are invested in actively managed mutual funds. The assets of the plans in the United Kingdom and Japan are invested in actively managed pooled investment funds. Each individual mutual fund or pooled investment fund has been selected based on the investment strategy of the related plan, which mirrors a specific asset class within the associated target allocation. The plans in Germany are unfunded and have no plan assets. Pension plan assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021 do not include any direct investment in Woodwards common stock.\nThe asset allocations are monitored and rebalanced regularly by investment managers assigned to the individual pension plans. The actual allocations of pension plan assets and target allocation ranges by asset class, are as follows:\nAt September 30,\nPercentage of Plan\nAssets\nTarget Allocation\nRanges\nPercentage of Plan\nAssets\nTarget Allocation\nRanges\nUnited States:\nAsset Class\nEquity Securities\n29.5%\n2.4%\n-\n51.2%\n30.7%\n2.5%\n-\n51.2%\nDebt Securities\n69.0%\n58.8%\n-\n87.6%\n67.7%\n58.8%\n-\n87.5%\nOther\n1.5%\n0.0%\n1.6%\n0.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nUnited Kingdom:\nAsset Class\nEquity Securities\n46.2%\n50.0%\n-\n90.0%\n42.3%\n50.0%\n-\n90.0%\nDebt Securities\n52.3%\n45.0%\n-\n70.0%\n57.3%\n45.0%\n-\n70.0%\nOther\n1.5%\n0.0%\n0.4%\n0.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nJapan:\nAsset Class\nEquity Securities\n39.9%\n36.0%\n-\n44.0%\n40.3%\n36.0%\n-\n44.0%\nDebt Securities\n60.1%\n55.0%\n-\n63.0%\n58.8%\n55.0%\n-\n63.0%\nOther\n0.0%\n0.0%\n-\n2.0%\n0.9%\n0.0%\n-\n2.0%\n100.0%\n100.0%\nActual allocations to each asset class can vary from target allocations due to periodic market value fluctuations, investment strategy changes, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions.\nThe following tables present Woodwards pension plan assets using the fair value hierarchy established by U.S. GAAP:\nAt September 30, 2022\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nTotal\nAsset Category:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,265\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n2,732\nMutual funds:\nU.S. corporate bond fund\n106,653\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n106,653\nU.S. equity large cap fund\n28,088\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n28,088\nInternational equity large cap growth fund\n17,475\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n17,475\nPooled funds:\nJapanese equity securities\n-\n-\n-\n1,775\n-\n-\n1,775\nInternational equity securities\n-\n-\n-\n1,610\n-\n-\n1,610\nJapanese fixed income securities\n-\n-\n-\n3,875\n-\n-\n3,875\nInternational fixed income securities\n-\n-\n-\n1,325\n-\n-\n1,325\nGlobal target return equity/bond fund\n-\n-\n-\n11,533\n-\n-\n11,533\nIndex linked U.K. equity fund\n-\n-\n-\n2,253\n-\n-\n2,253\nIndex linked international equity fund\n-\n-\n-\n4,271\n-\n-\n4,271\nIndex linked U.K. corporate bonds fund\n-\n-\n-\n12,124\n-\n-\n12,124\nIndex linked U.K. government securities fund\n-\n-\n-\n3,701\n-\n-\n3,701\nIndex linked U.K. long-term government securities fund\n-\n-\n-\n4,645\n-\n-\n4,645\nTotal assets\n$\n154,481\n$\n$\n-\n$\n47,112\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n202,060\nAt September 30, 2021\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nUnited\nStates\nOther\nCountries\nTotal\nAsset Category:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,508\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n3,832\nMutual funds:\nU.S. corporate bond fund\n149,727\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n149,727\nU.S. equity large cap fund\n41,988\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n41,988\nInternational equity large cap growth fund\n26,040\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\n26,040\nPooled funds:\nJapanese equity securities\n-\n-\n-\n2,610\n-\n-\n2,610\nInternational equity securities\n-\n-\n-\n2,180\n-\n-\n2,180\nJapanese fixed income securities\n-\n-\n-\n5,224\n-\n-\n5,224\nInternational fixed income securities\n-\n-\n-\n1,775\n-\n-\n1,775\nGlobal target return equity/bond fund\n-\n-\n-\n15,201\n-\n-\n15,201\nIndex linked U.K. equity fund\n-\n-\n-\n3,236\n-\n-\n3,236\nIndex linked international equity fund\n-\n-\n-\n6,093\n-\n-\n6,093\nIndex linked U.K. corporate bonds fund\n-\n-\n-\n18,438\n-\n-\n18,438\nIndex linked U.K. government securities fund\n-\n-\n-\n6,047\n-\n-\n6,047\nIndex linked U.K. long-term government securities fund\n-\n-\n-\n8,716\n-\n-\n8,716\nTotal assets\n$\n221,263\n$\n$\n-\n$\n69,520\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n291,107\nCash and cash equivalents: Cash and cash equivalents held by the Companys pension plans are held on deposit with creditworthy financial institutions. The fair value of the cash and cash equivalents are based on the quoted market price of the respective currency in which the cash is maintained.\nPension assets invested in mutual funds: The assets of the Companys U.S. pension plans are invested in various mutual funds which invest in both equity and debt securities. The fair value of the mutual funds is determined based on the quoted market price of each fund.\nPension assets invested in pooled funds: The assets of the Companys Japan and United Kingdom pension plans are invested in pooled investment funds, which include both equity and debt securities. The assets of the United Kingdom pension plan are invested in index-linked pooled funds which aim to replicate the movements of an underlying market index to which the fund is linked. Fair value of the pooled funds is based on the net asset value of shares held by the plan as reported by the fund sponsors. All pooled funds held by plans outside of the United States are considered to be invested in international equity and debt securities. Although the underlying securities may be largely domestic to the plan holding the investment assets, the underlying assets are considered international from the perspective of the Company.\nThere were no transfers into or out of Level 3 assets in fiscal years 2022 or 2021.\nOther postretirement benefit plans\nWoodward provides other postretirement benefits to its employees including postretirement medical benefits and life insurance benefits. Postretirement medical benefits are provided to certain current and retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries in the United States. Benefits include the option to elect company provided medical insurance coverage to age 65 and a Medicare supplemental plan after age 65. Life insurance benefits are also provided to certain retirees in the United States under frozen plans which are no longer available to current employees. A September 30 measurement date is utilized to value plan assets and obligations for Woodwards other postretirement benefit plans.\nThe postretirement medical benefit plans, other than the plan assumed in an acquisition in fiscal year 2009, were frozen in fiscal year 2006 and no additional employees may participate in the plans. Generally, employees who had attained age 55 and had rendered 10 or more years of service before the plans were frozen were eligible for these postretirement medical benefits.\nCertain participating retirees are required to contribute to the plans in order to maintain coverage. The plans provide postretirement medical benefits for approximately 7 retired employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries and may provide future benefits to 401 active employees and their covered dependents and beneficiaries, upon retirement, if the employees elect to participate. All the postretirement medical plans are fully insured for retirees who have attained age 65.\nThe actuarial assumptions used in measuring the net periodic benefit cost and plan obligations of postretirement benefits were as follows:\nAt September 30,\nWeighted-average discount rate used to determine benefit obligation\n5.70\n%\n2.80\n%\n2.45\n%\nWeighted-average discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost\n2.80\n2.45\n3.05\nThe discount rate assumption is intended to reflect the rate at which the postretirement benefits could be effectively settled based upon the assumed timing of the benefit payments.\nWoodward used a bond portfolio matching analysis based on recently traded, non-callable bonds rated AA or better that have at least $50 million outstanding to determine the benefit obligations at year end.\nMortality assumptions are based on published mortality studies developed primarily based on past experience of the broad population and modified for projected longevity trends. The projected benefit obligations in the United States as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 were based on the SOA Pri-2012 Mortality Tables Report using the SOAs MP-2019 and projected forward using a custom projection scale based on MP-2019 with a 5-year convergence period and a long-term rate of 0.75%.\nAssumed healthcare cost trend rates at September 30, were as follows:\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n6.00\n%\n6.00\n%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline\n(the ultimate trend rate)\n5.00\n%\n5.00\n%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\nNet periodic benefit costs consist of the following components reflected as expense in Woodwards Consolidated Statements of Earnings:\nYear Ended September 30,\nService cost\n$\n$\n$\nInterest cost\nAmortization of:\nNet (gain) loss\n(94\n)\nNet prior service cost (benefit)\n-\nNet periodic cost\n$\n$\n$\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and fair value of assets for the postretirement benefits:\nYear Ended September 30,\nChanges in accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n21,544\n$\n25,445\nService cost\nInterest cost\nPremiums paid by plan participants\nNet actuarial gains\n(3,504\n)\n(2,422\n)\nBenefits paid\n(2,744\n)\n(3,072\n)\nAccumulated postretirement benefit obligation at end of year\n$\n16,797\n$\n21,544\nChanges in fair value of plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n-\n$\n-\nContributions by the company\n1,821\n2,079\nPremiums paid by plan participants\nBenefits paid\n(2,744\n)\n(3,072\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n$\n-\n$\n-\nFunded status at end of year\n$\n(16,797\n)\n$\n(21,544\n)\nThe following tables provide the amounts recognized in the statement of financial position and accumulated other comprehensive losses for the postretirement plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAmounts recognized in statement of financial position consist of:\nAccrued liabilities\n$\n(1,803\n)\n$\n(1,808\n)\nOther non-current liabilities\n(14,994\n)\n(19,736\n)\nFunded status at end of year\n$\n(16,797\n)\n$\n(21,544\n)\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income consist of:\nUnrecognized net prior service cost (benefit)\n$\n-\n$\n-\nUnrecognized net gains\n(6,225\n)\n(2,815\n)\nTotal amounts recognized\n(6,225\n)\n(2,815\n)\nDeferred taxes\n1,247\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income\n$\n(4,978\n)\n$\n(2,526\n)\nWoodward pays plan benefits from its general funds; therefore, there are no segregated plan assets as of September 30, 2022 or September 30, 2021.\nThe accumulated benefit obligations of the Companys postretirement plans were $16,797 at September 30, 2022 and $21,544 at September 30, 2021. The largest contributor to the actuarial gains affecting the Companys postretirement plans accumulated benefit obligations were the claims experience being lower than expected and increase in discount rate.\nThe following table reconciles the changes in accumulated other comprehensive losses for the other postretirement benefit plans:\nYear Ended September 30,\nAccumulated other comprehensive losses at beginning of year\n$\n(2,815\n)\n$\n(362\n)\nNet gain\n(3,504\n)\n(2,422\n)\nAmortization of:\nNet gains (losses)\n(30\n)\nPrior service cost\n-\n(1\n)\nAccumulated other comprehensive losses at end of year\n$\n(6,225\n)\n$\n(2,815\n)\nUsing expected future service, it is anticipated that the future Company contributions to pay benefits for other postretirement benefit plans, excluding participate contributions, will be as follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\n$\n2,816\n2,765\n2,691\n2,602\n2,490\n2028 - 2032\n10,659\nNote 21. Stockholders equity\nCommon Stock\nHolders of Woodwards common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Board and have the right to one vote per share on all matters requiring stockholder approval.\nDividends declared and paid were as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDividends declared and paid\n$\n44,978\n$\n36,041\n$\n37,664\nDividend per share amount\n0.7325\n0.5688\n0.6050\nStock repurchase program\nIn November 2019, the Board had authorized a program for the repurchase of up to $500,000 of Woodwards outstanding shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over a three-year period that was scheduled to expire in November 2022 (the 2019 Authorization). During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 233 shares of our common stock for $26,742 under the 2019 Authorization. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 404 shares of our common stock for $45,860 under the 2019 Authorization, of which 110 shares repurchased were in-transit for $12,516 as of September 30, 2021 and received in fiscal year 2022. During fiscal year 2020, we repurchased 124 shares of our common stock for $13,346 under the 2019 Authorization.\nIn January 2022, the Board terminated the 2019 Authorization and concurrently authorized a program for the repurchase of up to $800,000 of Woodwards outstanding shares of common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions over a two-year period ending in January 2024 (the 2022 Authorization). During fiscal year 2022, we repurchased 3,890 shares of our common stock for $446,042 under the 2022 Authorization.\nStock-based compensation\nNon-qualified stock option awards and restricted stock awards are granted to key management members and directors of the Company. The grant date for these awards is used for the measurement date. Vesting would be accelerated in the event of retirement, disability, or death of a participant, or change in control of the Company, as defined in the individual stock option agreements. These awards are valued as of the measurement date and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite vesting period for all awards, including awards with graded vesting. Stock for exercised stock options and for restricted stock awards is issued from treasury stock shares.\nProvisions governing outstanding stock option awards are included in the 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended from time to time (the 2017 Plan) and the 2006 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2006 Plan), as applicable.\nThe 2017 Plan was approved by Woodwards stockholders in January 2017 and is a successor plan to the 2006 Plan. As of September 14, 2016, the effective date of the 2017 Plan, the Board delegated authority to administer the 2017 Plan to the compensation committee of the board of directors (the Committee), including, but not limited to, the power to determine the recipients of awards and the terms of those awards. On January 29, 2020, Woodwards stockholders approved an additional 1,000 shares of Woodwards common stock to be made available for future grants. Under the 2017 Plan, there were approximately 2,938 shares of Woodwards common stock available for future grants as of September 30, 2022.\nIn connection with Thomas A. Gendrons retirement, Charles (Chip) Blankenship, Jr. was appointed as Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company effective May 9, 2022. Mr. Blankenship received a one-time grant of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") on his employment start date with a target delivered value of $3,400,000, all of which is scheduled to vest on the third anniversary of the grant date, generally subject to his continued employment. He also received a non-qualified stock option grant on his employment start date with a targeted delivered value of $2,200,000, the exercise price of which was equal to the closing price of the Companys stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market on the date of grant and which is scheduled to vest over four years at a rate of 25% per year subject to his continued employment.\nStock options\nWoodward believes that stock options align the interests of its employees and directors with the interests of its stockholders. Stock option awards are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of Woodwards stock at the date the grants are awarded, a ten-year term, and generally have a four-year vesting schedule at a rate of 25% per year.\nThe fair value of options granted is estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-valuation model using the assumptions in the following table. Woodward calculates the expected term, which represents the average period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding, based upon historical experience of plan participants. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility using daily stock price observations. The estimated dividend yield is based upon Woodwards historical dividend practice and the market value of its common stock.

The RSUs granted under this program have a weighted average grant date fair value of $99.15 per unit and are generally scheduled to vest on the third or fourth anniversary of the respective grant dates, generally subject to recipients continued employment.\nStock-based compensation expense\nWoodward recognizes stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Pursuant to the form stock option agreements used by the Company, with terms approved by the administrator of the applicable plan, the requisite service period can be less than the four-year vesting period based on grantees retirement eligibility. As such, the recognition of stock-based compensation expense associated with some stock option grants can be accelerated to a period of less than four years, including immediate recognition of stock-based compensation expense on the date of grant.\nStock-based compensation expense recognized was as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nEmployee stock-based compensation expense\n$\n20,109\n$\n21,475\n$\n22,903\nAt September 30, 2022, there was approximately $16,261 of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements, including both stock options and restricted stock awards. The pre-vesting forfeiture rates for purposes of determining stock-based compensation expense recognized were estimated to be 0% for members of Woodwards board of directors and 7.3% for all others. The remaining unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.8 years.\nNote 22. Commitments and contingencies\nWoodward enters into unconditional purchase obligation arrangements (i.e., issuance of purchase orders, obligations to transfer funds in the future for fixed or minimum quantities of goods or services at fixed or minimum prices, such as \"take-or-pay\" contracts) in the normal course of business to ensure that adequate levels of sourced product are available to Woodward. Future minimum unconditional purchase obligations are as follows:\nYear Ending September 30,\n$\n464,073\n29,887\n1,305\n2,156\n-\nThereafter\nTotal\n$\n498,083\nThe U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of Woodwards government contracts (and, in general, subcontracts) at their convenience, as well as for default based on specified performance measurements. If any of Woodwards government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, the Company generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of Woodwards government contracts were to be terminated for Woodwards default, the U.S. Government generally would pay only for the work accepted, and could require Woodward to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government could also hold Woodward liable for damages resulting from the default.\nWoodward is currently involved in claims, pending or threatened litigation or other legal proceedings, investigations and/or regulatory proceedings arising in the normal course of business, including, among others, those relating to product liability claims, employment matters, workers compensation claims, contractual disputes, product warranty claims and alleged violations of various laws and regulations. Woodward accrues for known individual matters using estimates of the most likely amount of loss where it believes that it is probable the matter will result in a loss when ultimately resolved and such loss is reasonably estimable. Legal costs are expensed as incurred and are classified in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nWoodward is partially self-insured in the United States for healthcare and workers compensation up to predetermined amounts, above which third party insurance applies. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of related claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities.\nWhile the outcome of pending claims, legal and regulatory proceedings, and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that any liabilities that may result from these claims, proceedings and investigations will not have a material effect on Woodwards liquidity, financial condition, or results of operations.\nIn the event of a change in control of Woodward, as defined in change-in-control agreements with its current corporate officers, Woodward may be required to pay termination benefits to any such officer if such officers employment is terminated within two years following the change of control.\nNote 23. Segment information\nWoodward serves the aerospace and industrial markets through its two reportable segments - Aerospace and Industrial. When appropriate, Woodwards reportable segments are aggregations of Woodwards operating segments. Woodward uses operating segment information internally to manage its business, including the assessment of operating segment performance and decisions for the allocation of resources between operating segments.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those of the Company. Woodward evaluates segment profit or loss based on internal performance measures for each segment in a given period. In connection with that assessment, Woodward generally excludes matters such as certain charges for restructuring, interest income and expense, certain gains and losses from asset dispositions, or other non-recurring and/or non-operationally related expenses.\nA summary of consolidated net sales and earnings by segment follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\nSegment external net sales:\nAerospace\n$\n1,519,322\n$\n1,404,117\n$\n1,590,963\nIndustrial\n863,468\n841,715\n904,702\nTotal consolidated net sales\n$\n2,382,790\n$\n2,245,832\n$\n2,495,665\nSegment earnings:\nAerospace\n$\n230,933\n$\n234,356\n$\n310,137\nIndustrial\n82,788\n108,672\n100,321\nNonsegment expenses\n(81,092\n)\n(64,442\n)\n(94,530\n)\nInterest Expense, net\n(32,731\n)\n(32,787\n)\n(34,047\n)\nConsolidated earnings before income taxes\n$\n199,898\n$\n245,799\n$\n281,881\nSegment assets consist of accounts receivable, inventories, property, plant, and equipment, net, goodwill, and other intangibles, net.

Item 9A.\nControls and Procedures\nWe have established disclosure controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Principal Executive Officer (Charles P. Blankenship, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President) and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer (Mark D. Hartman, Chief Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nCharles P. Blankenship, Jr. and Mark D. Hartman evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. Based on their evaluations, they concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2022.\nThere have been no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in managements evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. We have evaluated the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and, based on that evaluation, have concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2022, the end of the Companys most recent fiscal year.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (PCAOB ID No. 34), an independent registered public accounting firm, conducted an audit of Woodwards internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 as stated in their report included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nInternal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our Board of Directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B.\nOther Information\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company announced a streamlined Aerospace and Industrial organizational structure and leadership designed to enhance the sales experience for customers, simplify operations, and increase profitability through improved execution. In connection with the organizational changes, Sagar A. Patel, who previously served as President, Engine Systems, departed the Company effective as of such date.\nIn connection with his departure, on November 14, 2022, Mr. Patel entered into a Separation Agreement and Release with the Company. Pursuant to such agreement, Mr. Patel will receive a lump sum cash severance of $1,084,400, representing the sum of (i) Mr. Patels base salary and target annual incentive bonus under the Companys short-term annual incentive plan (the STI Plan) for fiscal year 2023 ($884,400), and (ii) an amount intended to partially offset the estimated costs of a relocation by Mr. Patel from the Fort Collins, Colorado area ($200,000), as Mr. Patel had recently relocated to Colorado in connection with his appointment to President, Engine Systems. At the time of Mr. Patels departure from the Company, he was retirement eligible and therefore will receive retirement treatment under both the STI Plan and the Companys cash long-term incentive plan (the \"Cash LTI Plan\") with resulting payments, if any, based on the achievement of previously established targets under each such plan. With respect to the STI Plan, if any payout is to be made under the STI Plan for fiscal year 2023, Mr. Patel will receive a prorated payout equal to 4.93% of what Mr. Patel otherwise would have earned under the STI Plan had he remained employed for the entirety of fiscal year 2023, such proration representing Mr. Patels number of completed days in fiscal year 2023. Mr. Patel will not be entitled to any additional payouts under the STI Plan following fiscal year 2023. With respect to the Cash LTI Plan, Mr. Patel will receive payouts (if any) for three open Cash LTI performance cycles, with such payouts prorated at 68.31% for the cycle ending 2023, 34.95% for the cycle ending 2024, and 1.64% for the cycle ending 2025. In addition, consistent with the Companys standard treatment of equity awards upon a retirement, all outstanding stock options and restricted stock units previously granted to Mr. Patel will continue to vest based on the original vesting schedule, and all of his vested, unexercised stock options will continue to be exercisable for their respective remaining ten-year terms. Additionally, the Company will provide Mr. Patel a one-time payment of $50,000, approximating the pre-tax costs of (and in lieu of providing) continued healthcare benefits for a twelve-month period. The severance benefits are conditioned upon Mr. Patel not revoking, within a seven day revocation period, the Separation Agreement and Release, which includes twelve-month non-competition and non-solicitation provisions, a full release of claims against the Company, and a non-disparagement provision.\nThe above description of the Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the actual terms of the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.34 to this Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9C.\nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot applicable.\nPART III Item 10.\nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nThe information required by this item relating to our directors and nominees, regarding compliance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Act of 1934, and regarding our Audit Committee is included under the captions Proposal 1: Election of Directors, Board Meetings and Committees - Audit Committee (including information with respect to audit committee financial experts), Stock Ownership of Management, and, Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance in our Proxy Statement related to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held virtually on January 25, 2023 and is incorporated herein by reference.
