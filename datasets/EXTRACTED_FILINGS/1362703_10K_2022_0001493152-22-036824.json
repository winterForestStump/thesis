    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCorporate History and Structure\nTheralink Technologies, Inc., formerly OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company), was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology. On June 5, 2020, the Company acquired the assets (the Asset Sale Transaction) of Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation established in 2009 (Avant), pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 12, 2020 between the Company and Avant (the Asset Purchase Agreement). Avant was a commercial-stage precision medicine and molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of patented, proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians and patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, in the areas of oncology.\nPursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Avant and assumed certain of its liabilities. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Avant sold to the Company, all of Avants title and interest in, to and under all of the assets, properties and rights of every kind and nature, whether real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible (including goodwill), wherever located and whether existing or hereafter acquired, except for the specific excluded assets, which relate to, or are used or held for use in connection with, Avants business. The Company also hired Avants employees upon consummation of the Asset Sale Transaction. As consideration for the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company issued to Avant 1,000 shares of a newly created Series D-1 Preferred Stock which held 54.55% of all voting rights on an as-converted basis with the common stock. Upon the effectiveness of an increase of the Companys authorized shares of common stock from 6,666,667 shares to 12,000,000,000 shares, all such shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock issued to Avant automatically converted into 5,081,549,184 shares of the Companys common stock. Avant possessed majority voting control of the Company immediately following the Asset Sale Transaction and controlled the Companys Board of Directors after the termination of the ten-day waiting period required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Asset Sale Transaction was accounted for, in substance, as an asset acquisition of the Companys net assets by Avant and a recapitalization of Avant. Avant is considered the historical registrant and the historical operations presented are those of Avant since Avant obtained 54.55% majority voting control of the Company. All share and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes has been retrospectively adjusted for the recapitalization.\nOn June 5, 2020, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company; (i) entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Michael Ruxin to serve as the Companys Chief Executive Officer, President and a director; (ii) entered into an employment agreement with Jeffery Busch to serve as the Companys Chairman of the Board of Directors and; (iii) appointed Yvonne Fors to its Board of Directors.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Board appointed Mr. Andrew Kucharchuk as Acting Chief Financial Officer of the Company.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Board approved a change in the Companys fiscal year end from December 31 to September 30, effective immediately for the current fiscal year, and for all subsequent years until such time as the Board resolves to amend such fiscal year end. The fiscal year has been changed to conform to the September 30 fiscal year end of Avant which is the historical registrant as a result of the Asset Sale Transaction consummated on June 5, 2020 and therefore, no transition report is required.\nOn September 24, 2020, Andrew Kucharchuk resigned from his position as Acting Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Kucharchuk continues to serve as a director on the Companys Board of Directors. On the same day, the Company appointed Thomas E. Chilcott, III, to serve as the Chief Financial Officer.\nOn April 1, 2022, the Board of Directors was expanded to six members. Danica Holley and Matthew Schwartz were appointed to these newly created positions.\nBusiness Model\nThe Company is a commercial-stage, precision medicine, molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians, patients and biopharmaceutical companies, in the area of oncology. The Companys objective is to commercialize the technology originally developed by Theranostics Health, Inc. This technology is differentiated due to:\n\u25cf An exclusive license agreement with George Mason University (GMU).\n\u25cf\nA patent portfolio licensed from GMU and the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\u25cf Access to GMUs well-published subject matter experts and their pioneering work in phosphoproteomic-based biomarker diagnostics.\n\u25cf Expertise in cancer biomarker and data-generating laboratory testing data.\n\u25cf Development of proprietary, cutting-edge assays focused on precision oncology care.\n\u25cf Building revenue streams based on our proprietary technology.\nTheralink is advancing proprietary technology in the field of phosphoproteomic research, a sector which has emerged as one of the most exciting new components in the high-growth field of precision molecular diagnostics. This technology is intended to make it possible to generate an accurate and comprehensive portrait of protein pathway activation in diseased cells from each patient, which may enable providers to identify and match individuals with optimal targeted molecular therapies. This technology enables the quantitative measurement of the active protein(s) in cancer cells and their level of activation. The technologys measurement sensitivity is many times greater than conventional mass spectrometry and other protein immunoassays. Initially spun-out from GMU in 2006, and subsequently elevated to the federal governments Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards, Theralinks assay may prove highly useful for oncology patient management by improving (i) chemotherapy drug selection; (ii) immunotherapy drug selection; and (iii) optimizing combination therapy selection.\nThe biomarker and data-generating tests provide biopharmaceutical companies, clinical scientists and physicians with molecular-based guidance as to which patients may benefit from new molecular targeted therapeutics being developed for use in treating various life-threatening oncology diseases. These tests may also provide guidance to physicians on existing treatment standards that are recognized as the standard of care in the oncology treatment community. This addresses the core aspect of precision oncology treatment by identifying which individuals are more likely to respond to specific targeted molecular therapies, thus forming the basis for personalized medicine.\nThe technology is based upon the pioneering work of three noted scientists, Drs. Lance Liotta, Emanuel Petricoin and Virginia Espina, in proteomic-based precision medicine. Theralink benefits from a portfolio of intellectual property derived from licensing agreements with:\n\u25cf The US Public Health Service (PHS), the federal agency that supervises the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provides the Company with broad protection around its technology platform; and\n\u25cf GMU, which provides access to additional intellectual property around improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures that form the basis for future phosphoproteomics products.\nTheralink is committed to advancing the technology from GMU and the NIH as a platform for the development of new clinical biomarkers. These biomarkers and monitoring products may have the ability to provide biopharmaceutical companies and doctors with critical molecular-based knowledge to potentially make the best therapeutic decisions based on a patients unique, individual medical needs.\nMilestones\nIn the twelve months following September 30, 2022, the Company intends to focus on completing key milestones to create value for both investors and the healthcare industry. These milestones include:\n\u25cf Establishing laboratory Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to comply with New York CLIA standards;\n\u25cf Hiring additional lab techs and sales consultants;\n\u25cf Choosing members to sit on our Clinical and Scientific Advisory Boards;\n\u25cf Continuing to validate additional Theralink cancer biomarker technology under CAP/CLIA standards for a pan tumor assay to provide personalized medicine regarding treatment options for biopharmaceutical companies, clinical oncologists and their cancer patients;\n\u25cf Continuing to partner with pharmaceutical companies to perform oncology-related data-generating testing services which may generate additional revenues and\n\u25cf Continuing to seek financing to grow the Company.\nMarket Overview\nThe Theralink technology focuses on the oncology discipline of molecular pathology. Within oncology, Theralink is developing tests related to breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, gastrointestinal (GI) cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. Within the clinical precision oncology space, Theralink aims to be a leading Companion Diagnostics (CDx) provider by delivering assays that are intended to assist physicians when making pharmaceutical treatment decisions for a given patient. The license granted under the GMU licensing agreement excludes biomarkers for lung, ovarian and breast cancer in a diagnostic field of use.\nCDx results are intended to facilitate therapy selection by elucidating the efficacy of a specific drug or drug class for specific cohorts of patients within which a given patient is placed. Companion diagnostic companies are of particular interest to both drug development companies and physicians. Drug development companies benefit from the results of CDx assays by improving their accuracy in selecting patients for clinical trials who are most likely to benefit from the therapeutic they are developing. Physicians may benefit from improved decision-making information by allowing them to match a specific patient with the most effective treatment option. The basis of the effectiveness of companion diagnostic assays is built upon surrogate biomarkers, which are intended to measure the effect of a specific pharmaceutical treatment and its correlation to a biomarker, or endpoint. Theralink believes the most effective method to aid in therapy selection is by taking a phosphoproteomic approach to tumor analysis.\nAsset Description and Intellectual Property\nBackground\nTheranostics Health was a privately held company founded in 2006. Its core technologies were focused on the quantitative measurement of proteins contained in the key signaling pathways of a disease. These measurements include pre-analytical processing of preclinical and clinical samples, Laser Capture Microdissection (LCM), and Reverse Phase Protein Array (RPPA). The application of the technology has enabled Theralink to work with both fresh frozen and formalin-fixed, paraffin encased research and clinical samples.\nLCM is used to isolate specific cell populations from the many different types of cells usually present in a clinical biopsy tissue sample. Therefore, information derived from subsequent molecular assays is specific to that targeted cell population. RPPA enables sensitive, quantitative, calibrated, multiplexed analysis of cellular proteins from a limited amount of starting materials, such as clinical specimens. Theranostics Health had an exclusive license from the NIH to commercialize LCM isolation of cells for the proteomic analysis used for cancer therapeutics and companion diagnostics of which Theralink now is the licensee.\nPatent Portfolio\nWe have licensed 9 granted U.S. patents from the NIH and GMU. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they were obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application.\nGMU License Agreement\nOur exclusive license agreement with GMU: (1) Grants an exclusive worldwide license, with the right to grant sublicenses, under the Licensed Inventions to make, have made, import, use, market, offer for sale and sell products designed, manufactured, used and/or marketed for all fields and for all uses, subject to the exclusions discussed below; (2) Grants an exclusive option to license past, existing, or future inventions in the field of proteomics, from inventors that are obligated to assign to GMU and who have signed a memorandum of understanding acknowledging that developed intellectual property will be offered, subject to the exclusions discussed below; (3) The license and option granted specifically excludes biomarkers for lung, ovarian, and breast cancers in a diagnostic field of use and GMU inventions developed using materials obtained from third parties under agreements granting rights to inventions made using said materials; and (4) Grants right to assign or otherwise transfer license so long as such assignment or transfer is accompanied by a change of control transaction and GMU is given 14 days prior notice. In addition, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $50,000 to GMU as well as pay GMU (i) a quarterly royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by one and one-half percent (1.5%), due on a quarterly basis or (i) a quarterly sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by fifteen percent (15%). In addition, Theralink has the right of first refusal for all technology associated with RPPA technology from GMU.\nNIH License Agreement\nIn March 2018, the Company entered into two license agreements (NIH License Agreements) with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) which grants the Company an exclusive and a nonexclusive United States license for certain patents. Pursuant to the NIH License Agreements, the Company is required to make an annual payment of $1,000 to the NIH as well as pay the NIH a royalty equal to the net sales multiplied by three percent (3.0%) every June 30th and December 31st. Commencing on January 1st of the year following the year of the first commercial sale, the Company is subject to a non-refundable minimum annual royalty of $5,000. In addition, a sublicense royalty equal to the net revenue multiplied by ten percent (10%) will be payable upon sublicensing.\nRegulatory Approvals - CAP/CLIA and FDA\nInitially, the Company can provide data-generating services to certain counterparties such as biopharmaceutical companies for research use only (RUO). These arrangements will provide service revenues for the Company during its early years of development.\nThe Company may expand its data-generating services to address a broader range of clients, specifically, either as a direct provider of services to hospitals and chronic care providers for precision health screening by oncologists, or indirectly as a reference laboratory, thereby increasing potential services revenues. Oncologists may eventually use our data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, pancreatic cancer, GI cancer and non-small cell lung cancer patients, among others.\nCLIA are federal regulations for United States based clinical laboratories to provide industry standards for testing human samples for various purposes. These amendments were added to the laboratory requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR 493. Three federal agencies are responsible for ensuring laboratories comply with CLIA standards: Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the CMS, and the Center for Disease Control.\nAdditionally, laboratories can pursue a higher level of designation by becoming accredited by a recognized accreditation agency. The College of American Pathologists (CAP) is such an agency. CAP releases its own requirements, which are built upon CLIAs regulations. Compliance is assessed by a peer group site inspection every two years. Meeting these criteria ensures that industry specific standards for laboratory operations are upheld in the lab. These requirements are designed to identify areas for improvement to reach the highest level of quality. Theralink is currently CAP accredited.\nSubsequently, if Theralink receives FDA approval as a CDx, the Company would consider expanding its data-generating services by opening additional laboratory sites to assist oncologists using precision therapy selection in hospitals and chronic care provider groups. These oncologists would be using the data-generating services to optimize potential treatment protocols for breast cancer, gynecologic cancer, pancreatic cancer, GI cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumor patients once the Theralink assays are fully developed for these applications.\nThe attainment and timing of key regulatory approvals are critical and required to commence marketing and subsequent realization of revenues. The Company already has CLIA certification in every state except New York. The Company has obtained national CAP accreditation.\nGoals for 2023 and Beyond\n\u25cf Attain reimbursement for our proprietary laboratory analyses (PLA) code for our pan-tumor Theralink assay, commence mass marketing: explore international partnerships and start to review potential opportunities in Canada, Asia and Europe;\n\u25cf Increase mass marketing and market share in all approved jurisdictions in 2023 and beyond\n\u25cf Work closely with biopharmaceutical companies to have the Theralink assay named as a Companion Diagnostic.\nCommercialization Strategy\nTheralink is a micro-volume multi-marker tumor analysis platform that has been developed to improve upon the limitations of current techniques (such as western blot, immunohistochemistry (IHC), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS)) that produce low resolution information with modest gains in predictive power on which to base treatment plans. Theralinks Next Generation Proteomics (NGP) may improve decision-making for biopharmaceutical companies, oncologists and patients because it recommends therapeutic options that may be optimal for a patients specific tumor. We believe that our proprietary micro-volume protein expression platform can potentially improve the management of over 800,000 cancer patients in the US alone based on figures provided by the American Cancer Society.\nWe believe that our platform has potential application along the entire continuum of drug development: from discovery, to pre-clinical through to drug commercialization.\nResearch Use Only (RUO) Segment\nFor our RUO segment, target customers fall into two main groups: those requiring discovery and early-stage drug development, and those requiring later stage drug development.\nA. For customers in the early-stage drug development, Theralink provides target identification and validation, model system validation (cells, xenografts), and optimization of compounds in specific absorption rate (SAR) studies. Because Theralink is able to directly measure the drug target, this allows customers to make smarter decisions regarding the efficacy of their drug, and whether to move forward or not, thus allowing them to reduce cost.\nTheralinks advantages over its potential competitors on the pre-clinical side include:\n\u25cf The ability to measure multiple endpoints simultaneously (over 300)\n\u25cf Flexibility in choice of endpoints (post-translational modifications)\n\u25cf The ability to process different samples (cells, CSF, tissues, etc.)\n\u25cf Sensitivity: nL sample, representing <2,000 cells\n\u25cf Robust assays, reproducible, sensitivity, and specificity\n\u25cf Calibration across experiments, direct comparison\nB. For customers requiring later stage drug development, Theralink identifies markers for the customers to use in clinical validation, identifies pathway/marker sets with potential utility in the clinical setting, validates selected efficacy markers in Phase I and Phase II clinical trials, identifies markers for patient stratification, and validates markers for future companion diagnostics. The value that Theralink provides these clients is to identify the appropriate individuals for the customers drug trials, i.e., those individuals that have the relevant activated pathways that make them most likely to be responsive to the drug. This potentially will allow the customers to reduce the size of their Phase III trials, allowing for a substantial cost and time savings.\nTheralinks advantages over its potential competitors on the clinical side include:\n\u25cf First in class profiling of activated proteins in signaling pathways\n\u25cf One stop shop: from sample handling to LCM to data generation and final report\n\u25cf Sensitivity allows use of small clinical biopsy (less than 30,000 cells).\n\u25cf LCM allows purification of relevant cell populations\n\u25cf Focusing directly on relevant drug targets (marketed molecular therapeutics) and potential drug targets (those in development)\n\u25cf Identifying specific pathway signatures with focus on relevant nodes\n\u25cf An advantage for combination therapy, high specificity on targeted pathway, monitor compensatory pathways, and activation through feedback signaling.\nCAP/CLIA Certified Laboratory Segment\nSample processing is conducted through a single certified laboratory. Strategically, the data-generating services can be delivered at two distinct channels and are not mutually exclusive (i.e. can execute at one or both levels). The direct sales channel typically refers to marketing, sales and execution of sample processing and specific phosphoproteomic services to the end-user as the hospital and cancer center for precision health screening by oncologists. The reference laboratory channel typically refers to providing a subcontract service to one or more counterparties (who have CAP/CLIA certification), so we are not direct to the end-user in this channel.\nCLIA Approved Laboratory Segment\nSample processing may also be conducted through the certified laboratory that the Company manages. In addition to the direct sales channel, there is the companion diagnostic aspect to the end-user as the hospital and chronic care provider for precision health screening by oncologists that is specifically related to a drugs indication and efficacy for the patients specific cancer biomarkers. Theralinks involvement with biopharmaceutical companies in various stages of drug development and RUO projects could lead to the Company becoming a successful companion diagnostic for those treatments.\nOur initial objective was to capitalize on successful pilots with biopharmaceutical companies and leading medical institutions in a clinical trial environment. Management accomplished this objective with the successful commercial launch of Theralink during Q1 2021. Now we plan to gain rapid adoption as a differentiated technology in the personalized healthcare marketplace by leveraging the strong support of the many key opinion leaders and users of the pilot platform.\nOur flagship product for our commercial strategy, will focus on precision health screening for oncologists.\nThe key ingredients to our commercial success will be:\n\u25cf A proprietary technology that provides a credible point of entry to a well-defined medical market;\n\u25cf Comprehensive protocols for cancer biomarkers positioned for seamless integration to established standards of care for oncologist treatment regimens;\n\u25cf Eventually, a data friendly format and HIPPA compliance for ease of integration to monitoring systems and artificial intelligence (AI) modalities for oncologist teams to track precision medicine and monitor patient treatment outcomes.\nProprietary Technology for credible commercial point of entry\nWe believe that our focused technologies are of particular value to oncologist teams developing molecular targeted and/or combination therapies because of our ability to make very small and precise measurements in the cellular microenvironment. The platforms are based on assessing protein activation status (via post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, cleavage, etc.) of drug targets and receptors, their downstream signal transduction pathways, and potential compensatory or adaptive mechanisms within targeted cell populations. These commercial collaborations are critically important as they may establish our Companys platform as a must have in specific cancers (e.g., breast cancer management), where precise and targeted chemotherapy and immunotherapies can make a dramatic difference in patient outcomes. We intend to collaborate with top industry and medical institution oncology experts, and key opinion leaders (KOLs), who are focused on developing precision oncology therapeutics.\nStrong pipeline of potential commercial partners\nTheralink intends to deliver a comprehensive precision cancer biomarker platform by seamlessly integrating its technology into the workflow of oncologists in various healthcare networked systems. Currently, the oncology precision tumor analysis market is dominated by genomic diagnostic companies such as Genomic Health and Foundation Medicine. Theralinks technologies may provide a unique, complementary and actionable knowledge base to existing market players, seeking to improve outcomes for oncologists and their patients. Our targeted commercial partners are seeking technologies that help differentiate their approach to oncology care, by using patient-centric solutions to help enable better chronic patient management during and after treatment to help maximize patient outcomes and prevent recurrences. Theralink sees this as a major commercial opportunity to serve both hospitals and primary care providers in the US. These same hospitals and primary care providers may have connections to cancer treatment programs abroad (i.e. Europe and Asia).\nOperations During the Year ended September 30, 2022\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the Company focused on executing its business plan by validating its equipment in order to meet CLIA and CAP standards. In addition, the Companys management team has been actively marketing its Theralink assay to KOLs, channel partners, and cancer centers throughout the US. Management believes the Companys lab now has all of the instruments necessary to service biopharma clients with oncology-focused preclinical and clinical drug development programs. Arrangements have been made to obtain the necessary population data (additional cancer tumor samples) to help the Company continue to build Lab Developed Tests (LDTs) for other cancers for clinical clients.\nMarketing and Pricing\nTo date, the Company has derived its revenues primarily from biopharma research and development contracts. These contracts require the Company to provide services directed towards specific objectives and include developmental milestones and deliverables. Up-front payments are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized when milestones are achieved.\nMarket Opportunity\nThere are a number of key trends having a significant impact on the clinical testing business and represent opportunities for companies that can develop novel assays. Clinical laboratory testing is an essential healthcare service and is being favorably impacted by the following:\n\u25cf Demographics: The growing and aging population is increasing the demand for clinical testing;\n\u25cf Increased testing: Physicians are increasingly relying on testing to help identify disease risk, detect the symptoms of disease earlier, aid in the choice of a therapeutic regimen, monitor patient compliance and evaluate treatment results;\n\u25cf Advances in science and technology: Recent medical advances have allowed earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases and continuing research and development in the area of genomics is expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in, and demand for, personalized or tailored medicine;\n\u25cf Prevention and wellness: There is an increased awareness of the benefits of preventative medicine and wellness. Consumers, employers, health plans, and government agencies are increasingly focusing on detecting diseases earlier and providing preventative care that helps avoid disease.\nAs a result of these significant changes in the laboratory testing market, it is evident that there is a significant commercial opportunity for companies that provide products or services that address the new needs of the evolving precision medicine marketplace. This is the market opportunity that the Company is pursuing through its introduction of data-generating assays that use patented and proprietary technology to help improve patient health and help reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention, and treatment.\nOur Strategy\nThe Companys strategy is to use the technology it has licensed from GMU and the NIH to take advantage of the new opportunities that are evolving in the precision medicine industry, both for biopharmas and for oncologists and their patients. The Company was created to specifically commercialize reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays and services that are focused on determining the right drug, for the right patient, at the right time. These novel data-generating technologies are based on patented and proprietary technology that is well-suited to be run in a central or regional laboratory utilizing samples that are collected by healthcare providers and sent to the authorized CLIA certified testing facility for processing. The Company will market data-generating assays that may be over 90% actionable for intended use by oncologists and may be used to potentially determine which FDA-approved or investigational drug may be most efficacious in each cancer. To achieve this goal of commercializing new data-generating opportunities, the Company is leveraging off the strategic relationships that have been established with organizations such as GMU and others to develop unique and high value-added data-generating assays.\nGovernmental Regulation\nThe services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, or exclusion from government health care programs. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.\nClinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation\nOur clinical laboratory must hold certain federal, state and local licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. Laboratories in the United States that perform testing on human specimens for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease are subject to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or (CLIA). CLIA requires such laboratories to be certified by the federal government and mandates compliance with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification also is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill state and federal health care programs, as well as many private insurers, for laboratory testing services. We have received CLIA certification for all states except New York, which we have applied for.\nIn addition, CLIA requires certified laboratories to enroll in an approved proficiency testing program if it performs testing in any category for which proficiency testing is required. Our laboratory will periodically test specimens received from an outside proficiency testing organization and then submit the results back to that organization for evaluation. If our laboratory would fail to achieve a passing score on a proficiency test, it could lose its right to perform testing. Further, failure to comply with other proficiency testing regulations, such as the prohibition on referral of a proficiency testing specimen to another laboratory for analysis, can result in revocation of our laboratories CLIA certification.\nAs a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), a CMS agent (typically a state agency), or a CMS-approved accreditation organization.\nCLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. Our laboratory will be licensed by the appropriate state agency in Colorado. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable licensing laws and regulations.\nFood and Drug Administration\nAlthough the FDA has consistently claimed that it has the authority to regulate laboratory-developed tests that are developed, validated and performed only by a CLIA certified laboratory, it has historically exercised enforcement discretion by not otherwise regulating most LDTs. Nevertheless, the FDA recently indicated that it is promulgating draft guidance for FDA regulation of most LDTs in the future. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published a non-binding Discussion Paper proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft guidance, to spur further dialogue and give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. Recent agency announcements made in the context of the coronavirus (COVID-19) public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding the FDAs role in regulating LDTs: in August 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that the FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDAs longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.\nCongress has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including, among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the Verifying Accurate Leading-edge IVCT Development (VALID) Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act of 2021 (VITAL Act), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will enact legislation regulating LDTs and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in FDAs 2014 draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. We cannot be certain as to which of our tests, if any, would require FDA approval or clearance under any of the proposed frameworks and, if required, that our tests could obtain such approval or clearance.\nHIPAA and Other Privacy Laws\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), established comprehensive federal protection for the privacy and security of health information. The HIPAA standards apply to three types of organizations: health plans, healthcare clearing houses, and healthcare providers which conduct certain healthcare transactions electronically (Covered Entities). Title II of HIPAA, the Administrative Simplification Act, contains provisions that address the privacy of health data, the security of health data, the standardization of identifying numbers used in the healthcare system and the standardization of certain healthcare transactions. The privacy regulations protect medical records and other protected health information by limiting their use and release, giving patients the right to access their medical records and limiting most disclosures of health information to the minimum amount necessary to accomplish an intended purpose. The HIPAA security standards require the adoption of administrative, physical, and technical safeguards and the adoption of written security policies and procedures.\nOn February 17, 2009, Congress enacted Subtitle D of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. HITECH amends HIPAA and, among other things, expands and strengthens HIPAA, creates new targets for enforcement, imposes new penalties for noncompliance and establishes new breach notification requirements for Covered Entities. Regulations implementing major provisions of HITECH were finalized on January 25, 2013, through publication of the HIPAA Omnibus Rule (the Omnibus Rule).\nUnder HITECHs new breach notification requirements, Covered Entities must report breaches of protected health information that has not been encrypted or otherwise secured in accordance with guidance from the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). Required breach notices must be made as soon as is reasonably practicable, but no later than 60 days following discovery of the breach. Reports must be made to affected individuals and to the Secretary and in some cases, they must be reported through local and national media, depending on the size of the breach. Breach reports can lead to investigation and enforcement.\nWe are currently subject to the HIPAA regulations, and we will maintain an active compliance program that is designed to identify security incidents and other issues in a timely fashion and enable us to remediate, mitigate harm or report if required by law. We are subject to prosecution and/or administrative enforcement and increased civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, including a new, four-tiered system of monetary penalties adopted under HITECH. We are also subject to enforcement by state attorney generals who were given authority to enforce HIPAA under HITECH. To avoid penalties under the HITECH breach notification provisions, we must ensure that breaches of protected health information are promptly detected and reported within the Company, so that we can make all required notifications on a timely basis. However, even if we make required reports on a timely basis, we may still be subject to penalties for the underlying breach.\nIn addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are a number of state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our clinical laboratories. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results by strictly limiting the disclosure of those results. State requirements are particularly stringent regarding predictive genetic tests, due to the risk of genetic discrimination against healthy patients identified through testing as being at a high risk for disease. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations, including genetic testing and genetic information privacy laws in all state and federal jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the United States Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We will use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nInternational Regulations\nWe may market our assays outside of the United States and will be subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing laboratory licensure, human clinical testing, use of tissue, privacy and data security, and marketing approval for our tests. These requirements vary by jurisdiction, differ from those in the United States and may require us to implement additional compliance measures or perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing. In many countries outside of the United States, coverage, pricing and reimbursement approvals are also required. We are also required to maintain accurate information and control over sales and distributors activities that may fall within the purview of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions.\nReimbursement and Billing\nReimbursement and billing for precision medicine services are generally highly complex. Laboratories must bill various payors, such as private third-party payors, including Managed Care Organizations (MCO) and state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and each may have different billing requirements. Additionally, the audit requirements we must meet to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as our internal compliance policies and procedures, add further complexity to the billing process. Other factors that complicate billing include:\n\u25cf variability in coverage and information requirements among various payors;\n\u25cf missing, incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians;\n\u25cf billings to payors with whom we do not have contracts;\n\u25cf disputes with payors as to which party is responsible for payment; and\n\u25cf disputes with payors as to the appropriate level of reimbursement.\nDepending on the reimbursement arrangement and applicable law, the party that reimburses us for our services may be:\n\u25cf a third party who provides coverage to the patient, such as an insurance company or MCO;\n\u25cf a governmental payor; or\n\u25cf the patient.\nWhile the Company did receive a Medicare reimbursement rate for our billing code in fiscal year 2022, we have not submitted any claims to Medicare to date. When we start submitting claims to Medicare, we expect Medicare to process claims on a case-by-case basis; Medicare may adjudicate those claims by providing broad coverage, limiting coverage to specific circumstances, or denying coverage altogether. We are currently working to establish coverage and billing rates with other payors outside of Medicare. On rare occasions during our 2022 fiscal year, private pay patients have paid us between $1,500 and $3,500 for the results of our test. Third-party payers coverage policies and payment rates may change at any time.\nFederal and State Fraud and Abuse Laws\nA variety of federal laws prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These laws are interpreted broadly and enforced aggressively by various state and federal agencies, including CMS, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG), and various state agencies. In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs increasingly use a variety of contractors to review claims data and to identify improper payments as well as fraud and abuse. Any overpayments identified must be repaid to the Medicare program unless a favorable decision is obtained on appeal. In some cases, these overpayments can be used as the basis for an extrapolation, by which the error rate is applied to a larger universe of claims, and which can result in even higher repayments.\nAnti-Kickback Laws\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. Remuneration is broadly defined to include anything of value, such as, for example, cash payments, gifts or gift certificates, discounts, or the furnishing of services, supplies or equipment. The Anti-Kickback Statue is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry.\nRecognizing the breadth of the Anti-Kickback Statute and the fact that it may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the OIG has issued a series of regulations, or safe harbors. Compliance with all requirements of a safe harbor immunizes the parties to the business arrangement from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a business arrangement to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the arrangement is illegal or that the OIG will pursue prosecution. Still, in the absence of an applicable safe harbor, a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute may occur even if only one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals. The penalties for violating the Anti-Kickback Statute can be severe. These sanctions include criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, and some apply to items and services reimbursable by any payor, including private third-party payors.\nPhysician Self-Referral Bans\nThe federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the Stark Law, prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain designated health services, which include laboratory services, if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. Several Stark Law exceptions are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (1) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (2) payments by physicians to a laboratory for clinical laboratory services; (3) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that satisfy certain requirements; and (4) personal services arrangements. Penalties for violating the Stark Law include the return of funds received for all prohibited referrals, fines, civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have their own self-referral bans, which may extend to all self-referrals, regardless of the payor.\nState and Federal Prohibitions on False Claims\nThe federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. Under the False Claims Act, a person acts knowingly if he has actual knowledge of the information or acts in deliberate ignorance or in reckless disregard of the truth or falsity of the information. Specific intent to defraud is not required. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring an action on behalf of the federal government and to share in any amounts paid by the defendant to the government in connection with the action. Penalties include payment of up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each false claim, as well as possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, various states have enacted similar laws modeled after the False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state health care programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to any payor.\nCivil Monetary Penalties Law\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or the CMP Law, prohibits, among other things (1) the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state health care program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiarys selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state health care program, unless an exception applies; (2) employing or contracting with an individual or entity that the provider knows or should know is excluded from participation in a federal health care program; (3) billing for services requested by an unlicensed physician or an excluded provider; and (4) billing for medically unnecessary services. The penalties for violating the CMP Law include exclusion, substantial fines, and payment of up to three times the amount billed, depending on the nature of the offense.\nEmployees\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had nineteen active employees. The Company has not experienced any work disruptions or stoppages and it considers relations with its employees to be good. No employee of the Company is covered by a collective-bargaining agreement. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Operations\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future. To date we have generated little revenue or profit from our technology. We may never realize revenue or profitability. There is substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe had net losses of $12,741,962 and $5,471,649 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The loss from operations was $11,640,006 and $5,565,979 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net cash used in operations were $5,389,695 and $4,780,930 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $62,807,817 and $49,825,855, on September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, had a stockholders deficit of $6,801,055 at September 30, 2022, and had a working capital deficit of $2,808,736 at September 30, 2022. The Company had revenues of $567,905 and $505,604, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.\nOur losses have resulted principally from interest expense, professional fees, compensation expenses, costs of revenue and general and administrative expenses incurred while building our business infrastructure. We expect to continue to incur losses for the near future. Furthermore, we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of and seek regulatory approval for Theralink and any other services we may develop, prepare for and begin to commercialize by adding infrastructure and personnel to support the development of our technology and operations as a public company. The net losses and negative cash flows from operations incurred to date, together with expected future losses, have had and likely will continue to have, an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital. The amount of future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue.\nManagement cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. Management believes that our capital resources are not currently adequate to continue operating and maintaining our business strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund its operations in the future.\nAlthough management believes there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that might result if we are unable to continue our business. Our financial statements contain additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements describing our current circumstances. Even if we are able to successfully realize our commercialization goals for Theralink, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with commercialization of our technology, we will require additional funding. We are unable to predict when we will become profitable, if at all. Even if we do produce revenues and achieve profitability, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nWe will need additional funding to achieve our goals and may be unable to raise additional capital when needed, which would force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development and commercialization efforts. Raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nWe expect to expend substantial resources for the foreseeable future to continue the development and commercialization of our technology. We may not be able to generate significant revenues for several years, if at all. Until such time as we can generate substantial service revenues, we may attempt to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, government and/or other third-party grants or other third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our investors ownership interest will be diluted. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more research or development programs, which would adversely impact potential revenues, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our research and development activities.\nThe recent COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected and will continue to negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been taken or that may be taken in the future by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit COVID-19s spread have had, and we expect will continue to have, a materially negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary.\nIn addition, economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19, and as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the prices of our publicly traded securities may be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to our Product Commercialization Pursuits\nIf we fail to achieve and sustain commercial success for our services, our business will suffer, our future prospects may be harmed, and our stock price would likely decline.\nWe have sold or marketed our technology on a very limited basis. Unless we can continue to successfully commercialize our services or acquire the right to market other approved products or services, our business will be materially adversely affected. Our ability to generate revenues for our services will depend on, and may be limited by, a number of factors, including the following:\n\u25cf acceptance of and ongoing satisfaction of our services by the medical community, patients receiving therapy and third-party payors in the United States, and eventually in foreign markets if we receive marketing approvals abroad;\n\u25cf our ability to develop and expand market share for analyzing late-stage cancer patients, both in the United States and potentially in the rest of the world if we receive marketing approvals outside of the United States, in the midst of numerous competing technologies for late-stage cancer, many of which are already generally accepted in the medical community;\n\u25cf adequate coverage or reimbursement for our services by government healthcare programs and third-party payors, including private health coverage insurers and health maintenance organizations; and\n\u25cf the ability of patients to afford any required co-payments for our services.\nIf for any reason we are unable to sell our services, our business would be seriously harmed and could fail.\nIf Theralink were to become the subject of concerns related to its efficacy, safety, or otherwise, our ability to generate revenues from Theralink could be seriously harmed.\nWith the use of any newly marketed technology by a wider patient population, serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the technology itself. Any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved technology, cause us to modify how we market our approved technology, subject us to substantial liabilities, and adversely affect our revenues and financial condition. In the event of a withdrawal of Theralink from the market, our revenues would decline significantly and our business would be seriously harmed and could fail.\nAdoption of Theralink for the analysis of patients with either early stage or advanced cancer may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons, including competing therapies and perceived difficulties in the treatment process or delays in obtaining reimbursement. If Theralink is not broadly accepted as a technology option for cancer, our business would be harmed.\nThe rate of adoption of Theralink for early stage or advanced cancer and the ultimate market size will be dependent on several factors, including the education of treating physicians on the information provided by Theralink. A significant portion of the prospective patient base for the Theralink may be under the care of oncologists who may have little or no experience with our technology. Acceptance by oncologists of Theralink may be slow and may require us to educate physicians on the benefits of using our technology.\nTo achieve global success for Theralink as a technology, we will need to obtain approvals by foreign regulatory authorities. Data from our completed clinical trials of Theralink may not be sufficient to support approval for commercialization by regulatory agencies governing the sale of drugs outside of the United States. This could require us to spend substantial sums to develop sufficient clinical data for licensure by foreign authorities. Submissions for approval by foreign regulatory authorities may not result in marketing approval by these authorities. In addition, certain countries require pricing to be established before reimbursement for the specific technology may be obtained. We may not receive or maintain marketing approvals at favorable pricing levels or at all, which could harm our ability to market Theralink globally. Cancer is common in many regions where the healthcare support systems are limited and reimbursement for Theralink may be limited or unavailable, which will likely limit or slow adoption in these regions. If we are unable to successfully achieve the full global market potential of Theralink due to diagnostic practices or regulatory hurdles, our future prospects would be harmed, and our stock price could decline.\nRisks from Competitive Factors\nOur competitors may develop and market products that are less expensive, more effective, safer or reach the market sooner, which may diminish or eliminate the commercial success of any products we may commercialize.\nCompetition in the cancer information field is intense and accentuated by the rapid pace of advancements in product development. Further, research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs that render potential technologies obsolete before they generate revenue.\nMany universities and private and public research institutes may in the future become active in cancer research, which may be in direct competition with us.\nSome of our competitors in the cancer predictive biomarker space have substantially greater research and development capabilities than we do. Their processing, marketing, financial and managerial resources may be greater than ours. Acquisitions of competing companies by large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies could enhance our competitors resources. In addition, our competitors may obtain patent protection or FDA approval and commercialize predictive biomarkers more rapidly than we do, which may impact future sales of our technology. We expect that competition among technology options will be based, among other things, on price, safety, reliability, availability, patent protection, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities. Our profitability and financial position will suffer if our technology cannot compete effectively in the marketplace.\nWe could face competition from other technologies and products that could impact our profitability.\nWe may face competition in Europe from other technologies and products, and we expect we may face competition from those technologies and products in the future in the United States as well. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive approval frameworks and competitors are able to obtain broader marketing approval for predictive biomarkers, our technology will become subject to increased competition. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights could trigger such competition, and we could face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. We cannot predict the end results other technologies or other competing products could have on the future potential sales of our services.\nFailure to retain key personnel could impede our ability to develop our technology and to obtain new collaborations or other sources of funding.\nCompanies like ours depend upon our scientific staff to discover new technologies and predictive biomarker. They utilize these biomarkers to recommend treatment guidance for cancer patients. The quality and reputation of our scientific, clinical and regulatory staff, especially the senior staff, and their success in performing their responsibilities, may directly influence the success of our technology development program. As we pursue successful commercialization of Theralink, we will need to hire sales and marketing, and operations executive management staff in order to ensure our organizational success. In addition, we require additional executive officers to provide strategic and operational guidance. Our inability to recruit key management, scientific, clinical, regulatory, medical, operational and other personnel, may delay or prevent us from achieving our business objectives. We face intense competition for personnel from other companies, universities, public and private research institutions, government entities and other organizations.\nRisks Relating to Collaboration Arrangements and Reliance on Third Parties\nWe must rely on relationships with third-party suppliers to supply necessary resources used in our technology. These relationships are not easy to replace.\nWe rely upon others for resources used in the production of predictive biomarkers for the Theralink assay. Problems with any of our suppliers facilities or processes could result in failure to produce or a delay in production of adequate information used in the production of the Theralink assay. This could delay or reduce commercial sales and materially harm our business. Any prolonged interruption in the operations of our suppliers facilities could result in a shortfall in the information necessary to complete our assay.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nTheralink in clinical development may be limited in use if we do not maintain or gain required regulatory approvals.\nOur clinical business maybe subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal governmental authorities in the United States and potentially by foreign regulatory authorities, with regulations differing from country to country.\nObtaining regulatory approval for marketing of a technology candidate in one country does not assure we will be able to obtain regulatory approval in other countries. However, a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in other countries.\nIn general, the FDA and equivalent other country authorities require labeling, advertising and promotional materials to be truthful and not misleading and marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. If the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to challenge our promotional materials or activities, they may bring enforcement action.\nRegulatory authorities could also add new regulations or reform existing regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our technology. Theralink is a novel technology. As a result, regulatory agencies lack experience with it, which may lengthen the regulatory review process, increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of Theralink outside of the United States. We are unable to predict when and whether any changes to regulatory policy affecting our business could occur, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business. If regulatory authorities determine that we have not complied with regulations in the research and development of our predictive biomarkers, they may not approve the technology candidate and we would not be able to market and sell it. If we were unable to market and sell our technology candidate, our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur prospective revenues will be diminished if payors do not adequately cover or reimburse our services.\nThere has been and will continue to be significant efforts by both federal and state agencies to reduce costs in government healthcare programs and otherwise implement government control of healthcare costs. In addition, private payors continually seek ways to reduce and control overall healthcare costs. An increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States will continue to put pressure on the pricing of healthcare services. Uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of new applications and services. Third-party payors, including governmental payors such as Medicare and private payors, are scrutinizing new medical products and services and may not cover or may limit coverage and the level of reimbursement for our services. Third-party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for any of our existing service candidates or for tests we discover and develop, and a substantial portion of the testing for which we bill our hospital and laboratory clients may ultimately be paid by third-party payers. Likewise, any pricing pressure exerted by these third-party payers on our clients may, in turn, be exerted by our clients on us. If government and other third-party payers do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our tests, it could adversely affect our operating results, cash flows and our financial condition.\nRegulatory changes, such as proposed government regulation of Laboratory Developed Tests, could require us to conduct additional clinical trials or result in delays, increased costs, or the failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, which could harm our business.\nWe intend to develop diagnostic tests for clients that cannot currently be provided using test kits approved or cleared by the FDA. The FDA has been considering changes to the way that it regulates these LDTs. Currently, all LDTs are conducted and offered in accordance with CLIA, and individual state licensing procedures. The FDA has published a draft guidance document that would require FDA clearance or approval of a subset of LDTs, as well as a modified approach for some lower risk LDTs that may require FDA oversight short of the full premarket approval or clearance process. Congress may enact legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the FDAs role with regard to LDTs. As a result, there is a risk that the FDAs proposed regulatory process could delay the offering of certain tests and result in additional validation costs and fees. This FDA approval or clearance process may be time-consuming and costly, with no guarantee of ultimate approval or clearance.\nIn 2014, FDA issued draft guidance announcing that it would end its historical policy of enforcement discretion regarding LDTs and outlining the first of multiple frameworks that have been proposed for their regulation. FDA announced in 2016 that it no longer planned to finalize its draft guidance and that it would continue to exercise enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On January 13, 2017, the FDA published a non-binding Discussion Paper proposing a framework of LDT oversight largely consistent with the draft guidance, to spur further dialogue and give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. Recent agency announcements made in the context of the COVID-19 public health emergency have produced a shifting policy landscape and further uncertainty regarding FDAs role in regulating LDTs: in August 2020, HHS announced that FDA would not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, but in November 2021, HHS issued a statement withdrawing that prior announcement, indicating a return to FDAs longstanding approach to the regulation and enforcement discretion toward LDTs.\nCongress has also considered a number of legislative proposals in recent years that would amend the regulatory framework for LDTs, including, among other requirements, FDA premarket review of certain LDTs. The most recent such proposal, the VALID Act, was introduced in both the House and Senate on June 24, 2021. A competing legislative proposal, the Verified Innovative Testing in American Laboratories Act of 2021 (VITAL Act), was introduced in the Senate on May 18, 2021. However, it remains uncertain whether Congress will enact legislation regulating LDTs, and, if so, whether the legislation will be similar to the framework described in FDAs 2014 draft guidance or Discussion Paper, or either the VITAL or VALID Acts. It is possible that legislation and resulting FDA regulation may result in increased regulatory burdens and costs for us to seek marketing authorization for and maintain ongoing compliance for our existing tests, any modifications thereto, or any future tests we may develop. If the government begins to regulate our tests, it could require a significant volume of applications, which would be burdensome. Furthermore, governmental bodies could take a long time to review such applications and/or document responses if other laboratories were also required to file applications and/or document responses for each of their LDTs.\nIn the event that the FDA begins to regulate our tests, it may require additional pre-market clinical testing prior to submitting a regulatory notification or application for commercial sales. Such pre-market clinical testing could delay the commencement or completion of clinical testing, significantly increase our test development costs, delay commercialization of any future tests, and interrupt sales of our current tests. Additionally, the results of pre-clinical trials or previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or other non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to delay or denial of regulatory clearance or approval. The commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment, which is a function of many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Each of these outcomes would harm our ability to market our tests and/or to achieve sustained profitability.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business and must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive.\nOur operations produce hazardous waste products, including chemicals, radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these materials complies with the standards prescribed by state and federal laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of such hazardous waste products. We are also subject to regulation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the Environmental Protection Agency (the EPA). Additionally, we must comply with the regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other regulatory statutes, and may in the future be subject to other federal, state or local regulations. OSHA and/or the EPA may promulgate regulations that may affect our research and development programs. We may be required to incur further costs to comply with current or future environmental and safety laws and regulations. In addition, in the event of accidental contamination or injury from these materials, we could be held liable for any damages that result, including remediation, and any such liability could exceed our resources.\nIf we are unable to safeguard against security breaches with respect to our information systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nIn the course of our business, we gather, transmit and retain confidential information through our information systems. Although we endeavor to protect confidential information through the implementation of security technologies, processes and procedures, it is possible that an individual or group could defeat security measures and access sensitive information about our business and employees. Any misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential information gathered, stored or used by us could have a material impact on the operation of our business, including damaging our reputation with our employees, third parties and investors. We could also incur significant costs implementing additional security measures and organizational changes, implementing additional protective technologies, training employees or engaging consultants. In addition, we could incur increased litigation as a result of any potential cyber-security breach. We are not aware that we have experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a cyber-security breach or other act, however, a cyber-security breach or other act and/or disruption to our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability claims, and insurance against these claims may not be adequate and may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future.\nOur business exposes us to potential liability risks inherent in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of our technology. We may be subject to liability for errors in the test results we provide to oncologists or for a misunderstanding of, or inappropriate reliance upon, the information we provide. We have commercial product liability insurance coverage. However, this insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims against us. There is also a risk that adequate insurance coverage will not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. The successful assertion of an uninsured product liability or other claim against us could cause us to incur significant expenses to pay such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development or technology sales and could cause a decline in our revenues. Even a successfully defended product liability claim could cause us to incur significant expenses to defend such a claim, could adversely affect our predictive biomarker development and could cause a decline in our revenues. In addition, product liability claims could result in an FDA or equivalent non-United States regulatory authority investigation of the safety or efficacy of our test, our manufacturing processes and facilities, or our marketing programs.\nRisks in Protecting Our Intellectual Property\nWe have exposure to general uncertainty and complex legal matters regarding the patents we license.\nThe patent positions of companies such as ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of method of use patents or reformulation patents has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology and to enforce the patent rights that we license, and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from using, selling, offering to sell, or importing technology that infringe on our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our technology or the methods of use. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our technology. The issued patents that we in-license and those that may be issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related technology or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our technology. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or exclusively in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our technology. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing, and regulatory review of a potential technology, it is possible that, before any particular technology can be commercialized, any patent protection for such technology may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.\nIf we are unable to protect the proprietary rights we license or to defend against infringement claims, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably.\nWe develop predictive biomarkers that are the basis for or incorporated in our potential testing products. We protect our technology through United States and foreign patent filings, trademarks and trade secrets that we license from others.\nThe fact that we may file a patent application or that a patent has been issued does not ensure that we will have meaningful protection from competition with regard to the underlying technology. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, declared unenforceable or circumvented or may not cover all applications we may desire. Any pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents. Patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with, or who could develop, similar or competing technologies or who could design around our patents. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the pharmaceutical field in which we operate is continually evolving and can be the subject of some uncertainty. The laws providing patent protection may change in a way that would limit our protection.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements. Our policy is to require our officers, employees, consultants, contractors, manufacturers, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to an individual during the course of their relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances. We also require signed confidentiality agreements from companies that receive our confidential data. For employees, consultants and contractors, we require confidentiality agreements providing that all inventions conceived while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our exclusive property. It is possible, however, that these parties may breach those agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for such a breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets or know-how will otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors.\nWe are also subject to the risk of claims, whether meritorious or not, that our technology infringes or misappropriates third-party intellectual property rights. Defending against such claims can be quite expensive even if the claims lack merit. If we are found to have infringed or misappropriated a third-partys intellectual property, we could be required to seek a license or discontinue using certain technologies or delay commercialization of the affected technologies, and we could be required to pay substantial damages, which could materially harm our business.\nWe may be subject to litigation with respect to the ownership and use of intellectual property that will be costly to defend. The outcome of such a defense in uncertain.\nOur business may bring us into conflict with our licensees, licensors or others with whom we have contractual or other business relationships, or with our competitors or others whose interests differ from ours. If we are unable to resolve those conflicts on terms that are satisfactory to all parties, we may become involved in litigation brought by or against us. That litigation is likely to be expensive and may require a significant amount of managements time and attention, at the expense of other aspects of our business.\nLitigation relating to the ownership and use of intellectual property is expensive, and our position as a relatively small company in an industry dominated by very large companies may cause us to be at a disadvantage in defending our intellectual property rights and in defending against claims that our technology infringes or misappropriate third-party intellectual property rights. Even if we are able to defend our position, the cost of doing so may adversely affect our profitability. We may in the future be subject to patent litigation and may not be able to protect our intellectual property at a reasonable cost if such litigation is initiated. The outcome of litigation is always uncertain, and in some cases could include judgments against us that require us to pay damages, enjoin us from certain activities or otherwise affect our legal or contractual rights, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents and/or applications may be due to be paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), GMU, the NIH, and various governmental patent agencies outside of the United States in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and/or applications. The USPTO and various non-U.S. governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. We employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply with these requirements. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, our competitors might be able to enter the market creating a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on our technology in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from using our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing technologies using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own technologies and may also export infringing technologies to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These technologies may compete with ours and our patents or other intellectual property rights.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in Our Common Stock\nWe have issued, and may in the future issue, a significant amount of equity and convertible debt securities and, as a result, your ownership interest in our Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted and your investment in our common stock could suffer a material decline in value.\nIn the Asset Sale Transaction, we issued a significant amount of equity securities, including Series D-1 and D-2 Preferred, which have subsequently converted into approximately 5.1 billion shares of common stock during fiscal 2020. On November 29, 2022, the Company consummated a private placement offering (the Offering). In the Offering, the Company issued (i) 10% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the Debentures) in an aggregate principal amount of $16.9 million and (ii) warrants (the Warrants and together with the Debentures, the Underlying Securities) to purchase up to approximately five billion shares of common stock of the Company (the Common Stock), subject to adjustments provided in the Warrants and as described below.\nThe Debentures are convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time after the maturity date and prior to Mandatory Conversion (as defined in the Debentures) at the conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $0.003 per share and (ii) 70% of the average of the VWAP (as defined in the Debentures) (or 50% of the average of such VWAP if an event of default has occurred and has not been cured) of the Common Stock during the ten Trading Day (as defined in the Debentures) period immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. Alternatively, upon a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of the Debentures may elect to exchange their Debentures for newly issued convertible preferred securities at a price per share equal to the Qualified Offering Price or the five-day VWAP of the Common Stock prior to the date that is 181 days after the closing of the Qualified Offering. Using a conversion rate of $0.003, the $16.9 million of Debentures are convertible into approximately 5.6 billion shares of common stock, but such amount could be more based on the calculations described above.\nThe Warrants are exercisable for five years and six months from the earlier of the maturity date of the Debentures and the closing of the Qualified Financing, at an exercise price equal to (i) in the event that a Qualified Offering is consummated prior to the exercise of the Warrant, the price per share at which the Qualified Offering is made (Qualified Offering Price), or (ii) in the event that no Qualified Offering has been consummated, the lower of: (A) $0.003 per share and (B) an amount equal to 70% of the average of the VWAP (or 50% of the average of the VWAP if an event of default has occurred and has not been cured) for the Common Stock over the ten Trading Days preceding the date of the delivery of the applicable exercise notice. If there is no effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares underlying the Warrants within 180 days following the closing of the Qualified Offering: (i) exercise may be via cashless exercise, and (ii) 5% additional Warrants will be issued by the Company to the holders for any portion of each month without such effective registration statement. Therefore, the Warrants may be exercisable into more than the initial five billion shares of common stock. The Debentures and Warrants also contain certain price protection provisions providing for adjustment of the amount of securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrants in case of certain future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends.\nIn addition to the Debentures, we currently have 141.5033 Series C-1 Preferred shares outstanding, which are convertible into approximately 21.3 million shares of common stock. In addition to the C-1 Preferred, we also have approximately 1.9 billion outstanding warrants that are convertible into common stock subject to certain adjustments. We also have outstanding approximately 1.9 billion stock options issued pursuant to our equity incentive plan. As a result of these past issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted. In addition, we will continue to issue shares of common stock equity linked securities to finance the business when necessary.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile, and these issuances could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially. Such issuances of additional securities would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may further exacerbate any or all of the above risks.\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price, and the value of an investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases.\nThe trading price for our common stock has been, and we expect it to continue to be, volatile. The price at which our common stock trades depends on a number of factors, including the following, many of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf the relative success of our commercialization efforts for Theralink;\n\u25cf our historical and anticipated operating results, including fluctuations in our financial and operating results or failure to meet revenue projections;\n\u25cf changes in government regulations affecting our technology, reimbursement or other aspects of our or our competitors businesses;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf developments concerning our key personnel;\n\u25cf our ability to protect our intellectual property, including in the face of changing laws;\n\u25cf announcements regarding significant collaborations or strategic alliances;\n\u25cf publicity regarding actual or potential performance of our technology under development;\n\u25cf market perception of the prospects for biotechnology companies as an industry sector; and\n\u25cf general market and economic conditions.\nDuring periods of extreme stock market price volatility, share prices of many biotechnology companies have often fluctuated in a manner not necessarily related to their individual operating performance. Furthermore, historically our common stock has experienced greater price volatility than the stock market as a whole.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We are not currently profitable. To the extent, we become profitable, we intend to retain any future earnings to fund the development and growth of our business and do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, our stockholders will not realize a return on their investment unless and until they sell shares if the trading price of our shares appreciates from the price at which the shareholder purchased them, of which there is no guarantee.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares. The market for our common stock is limited and persons who purchase our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the purchase price paid by them.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier of the OTC Markets. Trading in stock quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets are not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like the NASDAQ or a stock exchange like the New York Stock Exchange. The OTC Markets are not liquid markets. There is currently only a limited public market for our common stock. We cannot assure you that an active public market for our common stock will develop or be sustained in the future. If an active market for our common stock does not develop or is not sustained, the price may decline. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nWe are subject to the penny stock rules, which means brokers cannot generally solicit the purchase of our common stock, which adversely affects its liquidity and market price.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations, which generally define penny stock to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to specific exemptions. The market price of our common stock on the OTC has been substantially less than $5.00 per share and therefore we are currently considered a penny stock according to SEC rules. This designation requires any broker-dealer selling these securities to disclose certain information concerning the transaction, obtain a written agreement from the purchaser and determine that the purchaser is reasonably suitable to purchase the securities. These rules limit the ability of broker-dealers to solicit purchases of our common stock and therefore reduce the liquidity in the public markets for our shares.\nIn addition to the penny stock rules, FINRA has adopted FINRA Rule 2111, which requires a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds for believing that an investment is suitable for a customer before recommending the investment. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customers financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. The FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive office at 15000 W. 6th Avenue, Suite 400, Golden, CO 80401 is leased from a third party. In December 2019, we entered into a lease agreement for our corporate and laboratory facility in Golden, Colorado. The lease is for a period of 61 months, with continuing rental options, commencing in February 2020 and expiring in February 2025. Pursuant to the lease agreement, the lease requires the Company to pay a monthly base rent of; (i) $4,878 in the first year; (ii) $5,026 in the second year; (iii) $5,179 in the third year; (iv) $5,335 in the fourth year and; (v) $5,495 in the fifth year, plus a pro rata share of operating expenses beginning February 2020.\nOn June 10, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to its existing Warehouse Lease (the Lease Amendment), effective October 3, 2021, for its laboratory facility in Golden, CO (see Note 11). The Lease Amendment provided for: (i) an extension to the term of the original lease to five years following the completion of the Companys improvements to the Expansion Premises (defined below); (ii) an expansion of the premises to include the premises located at Unit 404, Building F, 15000 West 6th Avenue, Golden, Colorado 80401, consisting of approximately 4,734 rentable square feet (the Expansion Premises); (iii) an annual base rent modification; (iv) an increase to the security deposit; (v) tenant improvement allowance; (vi) additional parking and; (vii) two renewal options, each for five year terms, for a total of ten years.\nPursuant to the Lease Amendment, the Company must pay a total annual base rent of; (1) $115,823 for year one; (2) $119,310 for year two; (3) $122,893 for year three; (4) $126,580 for year four; (5) $130,377 for year five; (6) $135,163 for year six; (7) $139,218 for year seven; (8) $143,394 for year eight; (9) $147,696 for year nine; (10) $152,127 for year ten; (11) $156,331 for year eleven; (12) $161,391 for year twelve; (13) $166,233 for year thirteen; (14) $171,220 for year fourteen and; (15) $176,357 for year fifteen.\nWe believe our facilities are adequate for our current and future needs. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nOn December 10, 2021, YPH LLC filed a complaint against the Company in the District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Theralink breached its Certificate of Designation for Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock by failing to honor a conversion notice submitted to it by YPH. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserted a breach of contract claim claiming that it has damages in excess of $100 million. The case continues to be in the pleadings stage with Theralink filing its last response on March 30, 2022. The Company believes these claims are without merit and intends to defend plaintiffs lawsuits vigorously. The Company currently believes the likelihood of a loss contingency related to these matters is remote and, therefore, no provision for a loss contingency is required.\nOn August 16, 2022, Erika Singleton filed a complaint against the Company in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, Case No. A-22-857038-C. Plaintiff alleges that the Company did not provide her with physical stock certificates for 200,000 shares of common stock Plaintiff purchased for $2,000 in 2017. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims against the Company for breach of contract, violation of Florida securities law, fraud, and unjust enrichment. The Company is currently set to file its responsive pleading on or before January 6, 2023. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information and Holders of Common Stock\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink, operated by the OTC Markets Group. Our symbol is THER.\nAs of December 28, 2022, there were approximately 238 record holders of our common stock. The number of record holders does not include beneficial owners of common stock whose shares are held in the names of banks, brokers, nominees or other fiduciaries and holders of unissued shares common stock.\nDividends\nPreferred Stock\nSeries E Preferred Stock Dividends\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Series E Preferred stockholder earned dividends in the amount of $160,000 and $152,890, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2021, we made cash payments in total amount of $152,859 towards the outstanding dividend payable. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $40,329 and $13,151 of Series E Preferred stock dividend payable reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as accrued liabilities instead of temporary equity, respectively. On November 29,2022, all Series E Preferred stock was exchanged for Debentures.\nSeries F Preferred Stock Dividends\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Series F Preferred stockholder earned dividends in the amount of $80,000 and $6,728. During the year ended September 30, 2021, no cash payments were made and during the year ended September 30, 2022, we made cash payments in total amount of $66,564 towards the outstanding dividend payable. On September 30, 2022 and 2021, we had $20,164 and $6,728 of Series F Preferred stock dividend payable reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as accrued liabilities instead of temporary equity, respectively. On November 29,2022, all Series F Preferred stock was exchanged for Debentures.\nCommon Stock\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock and have no intention of paying any dividends on the shares of our common stock.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nNot applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSpecial Note Regarding COVID-19\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in China, and by March 2020 the spread of the virus had resulted in a world-wide pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has required alternative selling approaches such as through social media. We may be unable to avoid future reductions in net revenue using these alternative selling approaches that avoid direct contact with our customers. The worldwide response to the pandemic has resulted in a significant downturn in economic activity and there is no assurance that government stimulus programs will successfully restore the economy to the levels that existed before the pandemic. If an economic recession or depression is sustained, it could have a material adverse effect on our business as demand for our technology could decrease.\nThe overall impact of COVID-19 continues to have an adverse impact on business activities around the world. If the COVID-19 pandemic intensifies and expands geographically, its negative impacts on our sales could be more prolonged and may become more severe. The long-term financial impact on our business cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nOverview\nThe Company is a commercial-stage, precision medicine, molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians, patients and biopharmaceutical companies, in the area of oncology. The Companys objective is to commercialize the technology originally developed by Theranostics Health, Inc. This technology is differentiated due to:\n\u25cf An exclusive license agreement with George Mason University (GMU).\n\u25cf A patent portfolio licensed from GMU and the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\u25cf Access to GMUs well-published subject matter experts and their pioneering work in phosphoproteomic-based biomarker diagnostics.\n\u25cf Expertise in cancer biomarker and data-generating laboratory testing data.\n\u25cf Development of proprietary, cutting-edge assays focused on precision oncology care.\n\u25cf Building revenue streams based on our proprietary technology.\nTheralink is advancing proprietary technology in the field of phosphoproteomic research, a sector which has emerged as one of the most exciting new components in the high-growth field of precision molecular diagnostics. This technology is intended to make it possible to generate an accurate and comprehensive portrait of protein pathway activation in diseased cells from each patient, which may enable providers to identify and match individuals with optimal targeted molecular therapies. This technology enables the quantitative measurement of the active protein(s) in cancer cells and their level of activation. The technologys measurement sensitivity is many times greater than conventional mass spectrometry and other protein immunoassays. Initially spun-out from GMU in 2006, and subsequently elevated to the federal governments Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards, Theralinks assay may prove highly useful for oncology patient management by improving (i) chemotherapy drug selection; (ii) immunotherapy drug selection; and (iii) optimizing combination therapy selection.\nThe biomarker and data-generating tests provide biopharmaceutical companies, clinical scientists and physicians with molecular-based guidance as to which patients may benefit from new molecular targeted therapeutics being developed for use in treating various life-threatening oncology diseases. These tests may also provide guidance to physicians on existing treatment standards that are recognized as the standard of care in the oncology treatment community. This addresses the core aspect of precision oncology treatment by identifying which individuals are more likely to respond to specific targeted molecular therapies, thus forming the basis for personalized medicine.\nThe technology is based upon the pioneering work of three noted scientists, Drs. Lance Liotta, Emanuel Petricoin and Virginia Espina, in proteomic-based precision medicine. Theralink benefits from a portfolio of intellectual property derived from licensing agreements with:\n\u25cf The US Public Health Service (PHS), the federal agency that supervises the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which provides the Company with broad protection around its technology platform; and\n\u25cf GMU, which provides access to additional intellectual property around improvements to the technology platform and biomarker signatures that form the basis for future phosphoproteomics products.\nTheralink is committed to advancing the technology from GMU and the NIH as a platform for the development of new clinical biomarkers. These biomarkers and monitoring products may have the ability to provide biopharmaceutical companies and doctors with critical molecular-based knowledge to potentially make the best therapeutic decisions based on a patients unique, individual medical needs.\nOur plan of operation over the next 12 months is to:\n\u25cf Establishing laboratory Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) to comply with New York CLIA standards;\n\u25cf Hiring additional lab techs and sales consultants;\n\u25cf Choosing members to sit on our Clinical and Scientific Advisory Boards;\n\u25cf Continuing to validate additional Theralink cancer biomarker technology under CAP/CLIA standards for a pan tumor assay to provide personalized medicine regarding treatment options for biopharmaceutical companies, clinical oncologists and their cancer patients;\n\u25cf Continuing to partner with pharmaceutical companies to perform oncology-related data-generating testing services which may generate additional revenues and\n\u25cf Continuing to seek financing to grow the Company.\nAppointment of New Directors and Officers\nOn April 1, 2022, the Board of Directors (Board) of the Company, voted to appoint Danica Holley and Matthew M. Schwartz, M.D. to serve as members of the Board, effective April 4, 2022. Ms. Holley and Dr. Schwartz will serve as members of the Board until the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Company or until his or her resignation or removal and otherwise until his or her successor is elected. The Board determined that Ms. Holley and Dr. Schwartz each meet the independence standards of the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and the applicable rules of the SEC.\nOn December 5, 2022, we appointed Faith Zaslavsky, age 48, as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective December 5, 2022.\nResults of Operations\nComparison for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nRevenue\n\u25cf During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we generated revenues of $567,905 and $505,604, respectively, an increase of $62,301 or 12%. The increase was primarily attributable to services performed under research and development contracts for pharmaceutical companies.\nCosts of Revenues\n\u25cf During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we incurred cost of revenue of $224,886 and $117,456, respectively, an increase of $107,430 or 91%. The increase in 2022 cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue over 2021 was because the Company was required to purchase expensive third-party samples for certain pharmaceutical contracts. This increased cost significantly decreased the gross profit for the 2022 period.\nGross Margin\n\u25cf For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, gross profit was $343,019 and $388,148, respectively, a decrease of $45,129 or 12% which represents a gross margin of 60% in 2022 versus 77% in 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenue and increase in cost of revenue discussed above.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, operating expenses consisted of the following:\nFor the Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\nProfessional fees $ 2,311,098 $ 903,932\nCompensation expense 7,373,037 2,259,273\nLicensing fees 138,440 131,469\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,160,450 2,659,453\nTotal $ 11,983,025 $ 5,954,127\nProfessional fees:\n\u25cf For the year ended September 30, 2022, professional fees increased by $1,407,166, or 156%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based consulting fees of $1,370,261 related to accretion of stock option expense from the issuance of stock options to consultants in August 2022.\nCompensation expense:\n\u25cf For the year ended September 30, 2022, compensation expense increased by $5,113,764 or 226%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation of $4,645,361 related to accretion of stock option expense from the issuance of stock options to employees in August 2022, and an increase in administrative compensation and related employee benefits and expenses resulting from additional employees being hired and a bonus paid to our CFO.\nLicensing fees:\n\u25cf For the year ended September 30, 2022, licensing fees increased by $6,971 or 5%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. Licensing fees are mainly for the lab software, the GMU license and state licenses. During 2022, the company obtained licenses from numerous states to conduct business as a certified lab. The expanded national footprint is the driving force behind the increase in licensing fees.\nGeneral and administrative expenses:\n\u25cf For the year ended September 30, 2022, general and administrative expenses decreased by $499,003, or 19%, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in laboratory and biological supplies expense of approximately $420,000 due to a decrease in breast cancer research and development, and a decrease in sample analysis services expense of approximately $584,000 due to the termination of our relationship with our service provider and bringing this function in-house.

Accordingly, we will have to raise additional capital in the near future to meet our working capital requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease the operation of our business.\nGoing Concern\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had net loss and net cash used in operations of $12,741,962 and $5,416,965, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders deficit and working capital deficit of $62,807,817, $6,801,055 and $2,808,736 on September 30, 2022. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that it will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt or equity capital. Additionally, the current capital resources are not adequate to continue operating and maintaining the business strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional debt and equity financings to fund its operations in the future.\nAlthough the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and from the issuance of promissory notes, convertible notes and convertible debentures, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nFinancings During Fiscal 2022\nConvertible Debt - Related Parties\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (First November 2021 SPA) with a related party, who is an affiliate stockholder (First November 2021 Investor), to purchase three convertible notes (collectively as First November 2021 Notes) and three accompanying warrants (collectively as First November 2021 Warrants), for an aggregate investment amount of $1,000,000.

The July 2022 Note and July 2022 Warrants include a down-round provision under which the conversion price and exercise price are reduced if the Company sells or issues any securities including options, convertible securities, with the exception of exempt issuance (as defined in the agreements), or amended outstanding securities, at a lower conversion or exercise price than that of the July 2022 Note and July 2022 Warrants. The conversion and exercise price of the July 2022 Note and July 2022 Warrants are reduced equal to the lower conversion and exercise price of the new issuance or amended securities. For so long as the July 2022 Warrants remains outstanding and until the listing by the Company or the trading of the common stock on a Qualified National Exchange (as defined in the agreement); (i) if the Company issues warrants to investors in an offering of common stock or of any equity linked security (each a Subsequent Offering), and such warrants equal more than 20% warrant coverage, then a number of additional shares will be added to the July 2022 Warrants such that the July 2022 Warrants shall equal the same percentage of the warrant coverage offered to the investors in the Subsequent Offering and; (ii) if the Company issues warrants in a Subsequent Offering which may be exercised by means of cashless exercises, then the July 2022 Warrants shall be exercisable by the same cashless exercise feature of the warrants issued in the Subsequent Offering. As of September 30, 2022, the July 2022 Note had an outstanding principal balance of $50,000 and accrued interest of $953.\nNote Payable - Related Party\nOn May 5, 2022, the Company and Jeffrey Busch amended the April 26, 2021 note with principal amount of $100,000 (Original Note) pursuant to which the principal amount was increased to $350,000 (New Note) with the Company receiving additional $250,000 of proceeds and added a conversion feature. The New Note bears an annual interest rate of 1% (which shall increase to 2% in an event of a default) and matures on May 5, 2024. The New Note may not be prepaid and is only convertible upon an occurrence of a public offering. The outstanding principal plus any unpaid accrued interest (Conversion Amount) of the New Note is convertible into shares of common stock at the price for which the common stock was sold in the public offering. Pursuant to ASC 470-50 - Debt Modifications and Exchanges; the amendment was accounted for as a debt extinguishment because the contingent conversion feature added to the New Note resulted in a substantial modification of the Original Note. No gain or loss was recognized in connection with the debt extinguishment. As of September 30, 2022, the New Note had an outstanding principal balance of $350,000, reflected as notes payable - related party in the accompanying balance sheet since the conditions for its contingent conversion has not yet been met, and accrued interest of $2,474.\nFuture Financings\nWe will require additional financing to fund our planned operations. We currently do not have committed sources of additional financing and may not be able to obtain additional financing particularly, if the volatile conditions of the stock and financial markets, and more particularly the market for early development stage company stocks persist.\nThere can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, if and when it is needed, we will be forced to further delay or further scale down some or all of our activities or perhaps even cease the operations of the business.\nSince inception we have funded our operations primarily through equity and debt financings and we expect that we will continue to fund our operations through equity and debt financing, either alone or through strategic alliances. If we are able to raise additional financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted. Obtaining commercial or other loans, assuming those loans would be available, will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe have identified the following policies as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 include, but are not necessarily limited to, estimates of contingent liabilities, valuation of marketable securities, useful life of property and equipment, valuation of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, allowances for accounts receivable, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions.\nAdditionally, the full impact of COVID-19 is unknown and cannot be reasonably estimated. However, the Company has made appropriate accounting estimates based on the facts and circumstances available as of the reporting date. To the extent there are material differences between the Companys estimates and the actual results, the Companys future results of operation will be affected.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2021. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under the FASBs Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company provides research and development support to biopharmaceutical companies to assist their drug development programs. In January 2021, the Company began performing tumor profiling to support clinical patient therapeutic intervention. The services provided by the Company are performance obligations under services contracts. These contracts are completed over time and may lead to deferred revenue for services not completed at the end of a period which is reflected as contract liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company may include, in accounts receivable, amounts billed to customers in advance of services being initiated or completed. If the Company has a right to such consideration that is unconditional such as for contractually allowed billings under non-cancellable contracts, such amounts billed in advance would be offset by a contract liability. Management reviews the completion status of all jobs monthly to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize. The Company offers these services to biopharmaceutical companies and to private individuals. The Company uses various output methods to recognize revenues. The revenue recognized from services provided to private individuals during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were minimal and therefore was not disaggregated for disclosure purposes.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are cash deposits received from customers and advance billing included in accounts receivable on uncompleted contracts for which revenues have not been recognized as of the balance sheet date.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases using the method prescribed by ASC 842 - Lease Accounting. The Company assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of a contract which is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.\nOperating and financing lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. Operating and financing lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and edging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (ASU 2020-06) to simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470- 20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. Under the amendments in ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and a convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 provide financial statement users with a simpler and more consistent starting point to perform analyses across entities. The amendments also improve the operability of the guidance and reduce, to a large extent, the complexities in the accounting for convertible instruments and the difficulties with the interpretation and application of the relevant guidance. To further improve the decision usefulness and relevance of the information being provided to users of financial statements, amendments in ASU 2020-06 increased information transparency by making the following amendments to the disclosure for convertible instruments:\n1. Add a disclosure objective\n2. Add information about events or conditions that occur during the reporting period that cause conversion contingencies to be met or conversion terms to be significantly changed\n3. Add information on which party controls the conversion rights\n4. Align disclosure requirements for contingently convertible instruments with disclosure requirements for other convertible instruments\n5. Require that existing fair value disclosures in Topic 825, Financial Instruments, be provided at the individual convertible instrument level rather than in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, for convertible debt instruments with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, amendments in ASU 2020-06 added disclosures about (1) the fair value amount and the level of fair value hierarchy of the entire instrument for public business entities and (2) the premium amount recorded as paid-in capital.\nThe amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year and are allowed to adopt the guidance through either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition. In applying the modified retrospective method, entities should apply the guidance to transactions outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are adopted. Transactions that were settled (or expired) during prior reporting periods are unaffected. The cumulative effect of the change should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption. If an entity elects the fully retrospective method of transition, the cumulative effect of the change should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the first comparative period presented. The Company is evaluating the impact of the revised guidance and believes that it will not have a significant impact on its financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuers accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of the revised guidance and believes that it will not have a significant impact on its financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to our stockholders. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSee Index to Financial Statements and Financial Statement Schedules from page of this annual report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Companys reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to material weaknesses, which we identified, in our report on internal control over financial reporting.\nInternal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Annual report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. Our managements evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting was based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nThe ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in our internal controls over financial reporting:\n(1) The lack of multiple levels of management review on complex accounting and financial reporting issues, and business transactions,\n(2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties and necessary corporate accounting resources in our financial reporting process and accounting function as a result of our limited financial resources to support the hiring of personnel and implementation of accounting systems,\nA material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur principal executive officer and principal financial officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to SEC rules that permit us to provide only managements report on internal control over financial reporting in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the quarter ended September 30, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

Our Board intends to adopt a code of ethics when circumstances warrant.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nNo director, executive officer, promoter or person of control of our Company has, during the last ten years: (i) been convicted in or is currently subject to a pending criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations and other minor offenses); (ii) been a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to any Federal or state securities or banking or commodities laws including, without limitation, in any way limiting involvement in any business activity, or finding of any violation with respect to such law, nor (iii) been a party to any bankruptcy petition filed by or against the business of which such person was an executive officer or a general partner, whether at the time of the bankruptcy or for the two years prior thereto.\nWe are not engaged in, nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation in which any of our directors, executive officers, affiliates or owner of more than 5% of our common stock is a party adverse to us or has a material interest adverse to us.\nCorporate Governance\nTerm of Office\nEach director of our Company is to serve for a term of one year ending on the date of the subsequent annual meeting of stockholders following the annual meeting at which such director was elected. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each director is to serve until their successor is elected and qualified or until his or her death, resignation or removal.\nCommittees of the Board\nOur Board held eleven formal meetings during the year ended September 30, 2022. All other proceedings of our Board were conducted by resolutions consented to in writing by all the directors and filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the directors. Such resolutions consented to in writing by the directors entitled to vote on that resolution at a meeting of the directors are, according to the corporate laws of the State of Nevada and our By-laws, as valid and effective as if they had been passed at a meeting of our directors duly called and held. During 2022, each incumbent director attended 75% or more of the meetings of our Board.\nWe currently do not have nominating or compensation committees or committees performing similar functions, nor do we have a written nominating or compensation committee charter. Our Board does not believe that it is necessary to have such committees because the functions of such committees can be adequately performed by our Board.\nWe do not have any defined policy or procedure requirements for shareholders to submit recommendations or nominations for directors. We do not currently have any specific or minimum criteria for the election of nominees to our Board and we do not have any specific process or procedure for evaluating such nominees. Our Board assesses all candidates, whether submitted by management or shareholders, and makes recommendations for election or appointment.\nA shareholder who wishes to communicate with our Board may do so by directing a written request to the address appearing on the first page of this annual report.\nAudit Committee and Audit Committee Financial Expert\nWe do not have a standing audit committee at the present time. Our Board has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as an audit committee financial expert as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K.\nWe believe that our Board is capable of analyzing and evaluating our financial statements and understanding internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. The Board does not believe that it is necessary to have an audit committee because we believe that the functions of an audit committee can be adequately performed by the Board. In addition, we believe that retaining an independent director who would qualify as an audit committee financial expert would be overly costly and burdensome and is not warranted in our circumstance given the early stages of our development.

Dr. Ruxin shall be entitled to the continued payment of premiums for continuation of his health and welfare benefits pursuant to COBRA or otherwise, for a period of eighteen months from the date of termination, subject to earlier discontinuation if he is eligible for comparable coverage from a subsequent employer. Mr. Busch is not entitled to any COBRA benefits pursuant to the terms of his employment agreement. If a termination occurs any time during the twelve-month period following a change in control the severance payment shall equal four time their base salary. All severance payments, less applicable withholding, are subject to the officers execution and delivery of a general release of us and our affiliates and each of their officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns in a form acceptable to us, and a reaffirmation of the officers continuing obligation under the propriety information and inventions agreement (or an agreement without that title, but which pertains to the officers obligations generally, without limitation, to maintain and keep confidential all of our proprietary and confidential information, and to assign all inventions made by the officer to us, which inventions are made or conceived during the officers employment).

The following table provides estimates of the potential severance and other post-termination benefits that each of Dr. Ruxin and Mr. Busch would have been entitled to receive assuming their respective employment was terminated as of September 30, 2022, for the reason set forth in each of the columns.\nRecipient and Benefit Cause; Without Good Reason Without Cause; Good Reason Death;\nDisability\nChange in Control\nMick Ruxin, M.D.:\nSalary $ - $ 900,000 $ - $ 1,200,000\nStock Options (1) - - - -\nValue of Health Benefits Provided after Termination (2) - 31,752 - 31,752\nTotal $ - $ 931,752 $ - $ 1,231,752\nJeffrey Busch:\nSalary $ $ 180,000 $ - $ 240,000\nStock Options (1) - - - -\nValue of Health Benefits Provided after Termination (2) - - - -\nTotal $ $ 180,000 $ - $ 240,000\n(1) Amounts represent the intrinsic value (that is, the value based upon the companys stock price on September 30, 2022 of $0.0035 per share), minus the exercise price of the equity awards that would have become exercisable as of September 30, 2022. These stock options had no intrinsic value as of September 30, 2022 due to the stock price being below the exercise price as of this date.\n(2) The value of such benefits is determined based on the estimated cost of providing health benefits to the Named Executive Officer for a period of eighteen months.\nCompensation of Directors\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we did not pay compensation to any of our non-employee directors in connection with their service on our Board.

The dividends shall be paid monthly at the option of the holder of the Series F Preferred in either cash or shares of common stock of the Company.

If advance approval is not feasible then the related party transaction will be considered at the next regularly scheduled Board meeting. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our Board is to consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction.\nDirector Independence\nBecause the Companys common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange, the Company has used the definition of independence of The NASDAQ Stock Market to make this determination. NASDAQ Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) provides that an independent director is a person other than an officer or employee of the company or any other individual having a relationship which, in the opinion of the Companys Board, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. The NASDAQ listing rules provide that a director cannot be considered independent if:\n\u25cf the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an employee of the Company;\n\u25cf the director or a family member of the director accepted any compensation from the Company in excess of $120,000 during any period of 12 consecutive months within the three years preceding the independence determination (subject to certain exclusions, including, among other things, compensation for board or board committee service);\n\u25cf a family member of the director is, or at any time during the past three years was, an executive officer of the Company;\n\u25cf the director or a family member of the director is a partner in, controlling stockholder of, or an executive officer of an entity to which the Company made, or from which the Company received, payments in the current or any of the past three fiscal years that exceed 5% of the recipients consolidated gross revenue for that year or $200,000, whichever is greater (subject to certain exclusions);\n\u25cf the director or a family member of the director is employed as an executive officer of an entity where, at any time during the past three years, any of the executive officers of the Company served on the compensation committee of such other entity; or\n\u25cf the director or a family member of the director is a current partner of the Companys outside auditor, or at any time during the past three years was a partner or employee of the Companys outside auditor, and who worked on the Companys audit.\nBased on this review, the Company has three independent directors pursuant to the requirements of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Matthew Schwartz, Danica Holley and Yvonne Fors. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nPreviously, the Company engaged Weinstein International C.P.A. to serve as our independent auditors. On June 4, 2021, the Companys Board determined that the Companys independent registered public accounting firm prior to the acquisition of Avant, Salberg & Company, P.A., would be the independent registered public accounting firm for the Company for the fiscal years ending September 30, 2021 and 2022. Accordingly, Weinstein, the independent public accounting firm of Avant, as the accounting acquirer, was dismissed and will no longer be the Companys independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to our Company for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 for professional services rendered by Salberg & Company, P.A., our independent registered public accounting firms:\nFees\nAudit Fees $ 81,500 $ 72,000\nAudit Related Fees 1,000 -\nTax Fees - -\nOther Fees - -\nTotal Fees $ 82,500 $ 72,000\nThe following table sets forth the fees billed to our Company for the year ended September 30, 2020 for professional services rendered by Weinstein International C.P.A., our prior independent registered public accounting firms:\nFees\nAudit Fees $ - $ 64,000\nAudit Related Fees - -\nTax Fees - -\nOther Fees - -\nTotal Fees $ - $ 64,000\nAudit Fees\nAudit fees were for professional services rendered for the audits of our annual financial statements and for review of our quarterly financial statements during the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years.\nAudit-related Fees\nThis category consists of assurance and related services by the independent registered public accounting firm that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported above under Audit Fees.\nTax Fees\nAs our independent registered public accountants did not provide any services to us for tax compliance, tax advice and tax planning during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, no tax fees were billed or paid during those fiscal years.\nAll Other Fees\nOur independent registered public accountants did not provide any products and services not disclosed in the table above during the 2022 and 2021 fiscal years. As a result, there were no other fees billed or paid during those fiscal years.\nPolicy on Pre-Approval of Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nPrior to the engagement, the Board pre-approves these services by category of service. The fees are budgeted, and the Board requires the independent registered public accounting firm and management to report actual fees versus the budget periodically throughout the year by category of service. During the year, circumstances may arise when it may become necessary to engage the independent registered public accounting firm for additional services not contemplated in the original pre-approval. In those instances, the Board requires specific pre-approval before engaging the independent registered public accounting firm.\nThe Board may delegate pre-approval authority to one or more of its members. The member to whom such authority is delegated must report, for informational purposes only, any pre-approval decisions to the Board at its next scheduled meeting.\nOur Board has considered the nature and amount of fees billed by our independent registered public accounting firm and believe that the provision of services for activities unrelated to the audit is compatible with maintaining their respective independence.\nPART IV ITEM 15.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 and 2021\nCONTENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID No, 106)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of:\nTheralink Technologies, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Theralink Technologies, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the consolidated related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $12,741,962 and net cash used in operating activities of $5,389,695 for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders deficit and working capital of $62,807,817, $6,801,055 and $2,808,736 respectively, at September 30, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements Plan regarding these matters is also described in Note 2. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nNW Corporate Blvd., Suite 240 Boca Raton, FL 33431-7328\nPhone: (561) 995-8270 Toll Free: (866) CPA-8500 Fax: (561) 995-1920\nwww.salbergco.com info@salbergco.com\nMember National Association of Certified Valuation Analysts Registered with the PCAOB\nMember CPAConnect with Affiliated Offices Worldwide Member AICPA Center for Audit Quality\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of Stock Options\nAs described in Footnote 2 Stock-Based Compensation and Footnote 10 Stockholders Deficit to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded stock options expense during 2022 resulting from a grant in August 2022 of a large quantity of stock options to issue common stock to employees and consultants. The grant resulted in a total stock options value of $7,985,924 with $6,015,622 recognized in 2022 and $1,970,302 to be potentially recognized in the future.\nWe identified the valuation the stock options as a critical audit matter. Auditing managements valuation of stock options involved a high degree of subjectivity.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address these critical audit matters included (a) reviewed managements process for valuing the stock options, (b) determined whether the valuation method management selected was reasonable by comparing it to generally accepted methodologies for valuing stock options, (c) tested managements valuation of the stock options by testing assumptions and data used in the valuation model including the expected term, volatility and interest rate, and (d) recomputed the stock options valuations. We agreed with managements final conclusions with regard to the stock options valuations and believe such valuations are fairly stated.\n/s/ Salberg & Company, P.A.\nSALBERG & COMPANY, P.A.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nBoca Raton, Florida\nDecember 29, 2022\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash $ 393,460 $ 314,151\nAccounts receivable, net 32,125 -\nOther receivable (related party $0 in 2022 and $21,711 in 2021) -

ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nTheralink Technologies, Inc., formerly OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the Company), was a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a proprietary vaccine technology. On June 5, 2020, the Company acquired the assets (the Asset Sale Transaction) of Avant Diagnostics, Inc., a Nevada corporation established in 2009 (Avant) pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated May 12, 2020, between the Company and Avant (the Asset Purchase Agreement). Avant is a commercial-stage precision medicine and molecular data-generating company that focuses on the development and commercialization of a series of patented, proprietary data-generating assays that may provide important actionable information for physicians and patients, as well as biopharmaceutical companies, in the area of oncology.\nPursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Avant and assumed certain of its liabilities. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Avant sold to the Company, all of Avants title and interest in all the assets, properties and rights of every kind and nature, whether real, personal or mixed, tangible or intangible (including goodwill), wherever located and whether existing or hereafter acquired, except for the specific excluded assets, which relate to, or are used or held for use in connection with, Avants business. The Company also hired Avants employees upon consummation of the Asset Sale Transaction. As consideration for the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company issued to Avant 1,000 shares of a newly created Series D-1 Preferred Stock which held 54.55% of all voting rights on an as-converted basis with the common stock. Upon the effectiveness of an increase of the Companys authorized shares of common stock from 6,666,667 shares to 12,000,000,000 shares, all such shares of Series D-1 Preferred Stock issued to Avant automatically converted into 5,081,549,184 shares of the Companys common stock. Avant possessed majority voting control of the Company immediately following the Asset Sale Transaction and controlled the Companys Board of Directors after the termination of the ten-day waiting period required by Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Asset Sale Transaction was accounted for, in substance, as an asset acquisition of the Companys net asset by Avant and a recapitalization of Avant. Avant is considered the historical registrant and the historical operations presented are those of Avant since Avant obtained 54.55% majority voting control of the Company. All share and per share data in the accompanying financial statements and footnotes has been retrospectively adjusted for the recapitalization.\nOn July 11, 2021, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, OncBioMune, LLC, was administratively dissolved by the Louisiana Secretary of State for failing to meet its filing requirements and pay the associated fees (see Note 3).\nIn connection with the Asset Sale Transaction, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement, effective June 5, 2020, by and among OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the investors named therein, whereby the Company agreed to exchange certain convertible promissory notes and warrants outstanding for shares of Series C-1 Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company and options to purchase shares of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, OncBioMune Sub Inc. OncBioMune Sub Inc. holds the patents used in the prior business of OncBioMune Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In July 2021, certain of those investors exercised their options to purchase the shares of OncBioMune Sub Inc. On July 26, 2021, the Company transferred all 10,000 shares of OncBioMune Sub Inc. held by the Company to the various investors for gross proceeds of $1,000 (see Note 3).\nOn February 25, 2022, FINRA recognized the Companys name change to Theralink Technologies, Inc. and the related ticker symbol change from OBMP to THER went into effect.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America which present the consolidated financial statements of the Company and its wholly-owned, inactive subsidiaries, OncBioMune, LLC. (through dissolution date of July 11, 2021) and OncBioMune Sub, Inc. (through sale date of July 26, 2021). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nGoing Concern\nThese financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had net loss and net cash used in operations of $12,741,962 and $5,389,695, respectively, for the year ended September 30, 2022. Additionally, the Company had an accumulated deficit, stockholders deficit and working capital deficit of $62,807,817, $6,801,055 and $2,808,736 on September 30, 2022. Management believes that these matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the issuance date of this report.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that it will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive or raise additional debt or equity capital. Additionally, the current capital resources are not adequate to continue operating and maintaining the business strategy for a period of twelve months from the issuance date of this report. The Company will seek to raise capital through additional debt and equity financings to fund its operations in the future.\nAlthough the Company has historically raised capital from sales of equity and the issuance of promissory notes convertible notes and convertible debentures, there is no assurance that it will be able to continue to do so. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management expects that the Company will need to curtail or cease operations. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Management bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience, and various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances, to determine the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant estimates during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 include, but are not necessarily limited to, estimates of contingent liabilities, valuation of marketable securities, useful life of property and equipment, valuation of right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-lived assets, allowances for accounts receivable, estimates of current and deferred income taxes and deferred tax valuation allowances and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measurements\nFASB ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. FASB ASC 820 requires disclosures about the fair value of all financial instruments, whether or not recognized, for financial statement purposes. Disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments are based on pertinent information available to the Company on September 30, 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, the estimates presented in these financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized on the disposition of the financial instruments. FASB ASC 820 specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.\nLevel 2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.\nLevel 3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Companys investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. The Company periodically monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nPrepaid Assets\nPrepaid assets are carried at amortized cost. Significant prepaid assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 include, but are not necessarily limited to, prepaid insurance, prepaid consulting fees, prepaid equipment maintenance fees and retainers for professional services.\nLaboratory Supplies\nLaboratory supplies are normally consumed within a year from purchase and any unused laboratory supplies are classified as current assets and reflected in the accompanying balance sheets as laboratory supplies.\nProperty and Equipment\nFixed assets are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term including scheduled renewal terms. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount of impairment is measured as the difference between the assets estimated fair value and its book value.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of ASC 718 - Compensation -Stock Compensation, which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, director, or non-employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee, director, and non-employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The Company has elected to recognize forfeitures as they occur as permitted under the FASBs Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment.\nRevenue Recognition and Contract Assets and Liabilities\nIn accordance with ASU Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps:\nStep 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.\nStep 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 3: Determine the transaction price.\nStep 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.\nStep 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Company provides research and development support to biopharmaceutical companies to assist their drug development programs. In January 2021, the Company began performing tumor profiling to support clinical patient therapeutic intervention. The services provided by the Company are performance obligations under services contracts. These contracts are completed over time and may lead to deferred revenue for services not completed at the end of a period which is reflected as contract liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet. The Company may include, in accounts receivable, amounts billed to customers in advance of services being initiated or completed. If the Company has a right to such consideration that is unconditional such as for contractually allowed billings under non-cancellable contracts, such amounts billed in advance would be offset by a contract liability. Management reviews the completion status of all jobs monthly to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize. The Company offers these services to biopharmaceutical companies and to private individuals. The Company uses various output methods to recognize revenues. The revenue recognized from services provided to private individuals during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were minimal and therefore was not disaggregated for disclosure purposes.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are cash deposits received from customers and advance billing included in accounts receivable on uncompleted contracts for which revenues have not been recognized as of the balance sheet date.\nContract liabilities as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF CONTRACT LIABILITIES\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nContract liabilities beginning balance $ 135,150 $ -\nBillings and cash receipts on uncompleted contracts 325,048 281,012\nLess: revenues recognized during the period (303,648 ) (145,862 )\nTotal contract liabilities $ 156,550 $ 135,150\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company recognized $303,648 of the contract liabilities into revenue, of which $54,600 was related to the uncompleted contracts from the prior period.\nCost of Revenue\nThe cost of revenue consists of the cost of labor, supplies and materials.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade receivables are carried at their estimated collectible amounts. Trade credit is generally extended on a short-term basis and does not bear interest. Trade accounts receivable are periodically evaluated for collectability based on past credit history with customers and their current financial condition.\nAny charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible accounts at a level management believes is adequate to cover any probable losses. Management determines the adequacy of the allowance based on historical write-off percentages and the current status of accounts receivable. Accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance when collectability is determined to be permanently impaired.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company joined and made an investment in an investigator-initiated study during the year ended September 30, 2022. As part of that investment, the Company obtained rights/access to various retrospective biobank clinical samples for research and product development purposes. In addition, the Company received active patient clinical samples in the following disease sites: ovarian, endometrial, and head & neck cancers. These samples were tested to provide RUO (Research Use Only) results reports for research and product validation efforts. The transaction term is for 5-years, starting in January 2022. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had spent $150,000 and $0 on this research and development project, which is included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations.\nConcentrations\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash in banks and financial institutions that at times may exceed the federally insured limit of $250,000. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the cash balances were in excess of the FDIC insured limit by $186,466 and $68,122, respectively. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts through June 30, 2022.\nConcentration of Revenues\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company generated total revenue of $567,905 of which 21%, 15%, 14% and 10% were from four of the Companys customers. For the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company generated total revenue of $505,604 of which 31%, 12%, 12% and 11% were from four of the Companys customers.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nConcentration of Accounts Receivable\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had net accounts receivable of $32,125 of which 59% and 41% were from two of the Companys customers, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the Company did not have any accounts receivable.\nConcentration of Contract Liabilities\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had deferred revenue reflected as contract liabilities of $156,550 of which 65% and 24% were from two of the Companys customers. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had deferred revenue reflected as contract liabilities of $135,150 of which 56%, 24% and 16% were from three of the Companys customers.\nConcentration of Vendors\nGenerally, the Company relies on one vendor to perform the Companys patient reporting and contract research (formerly called sample analysis) which is an integral part of the Companys operation and revenue stream. Any disruption in this service could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company discontinued using this vendor in June 2022 as the patient reporting function has been moved in-house.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $272,904 and $860,954, respectively, or 100%, of its patient reporting and contract research (formerly called sample analysis) expense from one vendor.\nBasic and Diluted Loss Per Share\nPursuant to ASC 260-10-45, basic loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares consist of common stock issuable for stock options and warrants (using the treasury stock method), convertible notes, conversion of preferred stock, and common stock issuable. These common stock equivalents may be dilutive in the future. The following potentially dilutive equity securities outstanding as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 were not included in the computation of dilutive loss per common share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive:\nSCHEDULE OF ANTI-DILUTIVE SHARES OUTSTANDING\nSeptember 30,\nStock warrants 1,888,813,005 984,470,116\nStock options 1,901,410,519 -\nSeries C-1 preferred stock 156,626,175 445,301,289\nSeries C-2 preferred stock 453,067,129 733,542,619\nSeries E preferred stock 638,977,636 638,977,636\nSeries F preferred stock 319,488,818 319,488,818\nConvertible notes 1,813,880,837 319,488,711\nTotal antidilutive securities excluded from computation of earnings 7,172,264,119 3,441,269,189\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income tax using the liability method prescribed by ASC 740 - Income Taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will be in effect in the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance to offset deferred tax assets if based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or loss in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of ASC 740 Income Taxes. Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no uncertain tax positions that qualify for either recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in other expense. However, no such interest and penalties were recorded as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nRelated Parties\nParties are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nLeases\nThe Company accounts for its leases using the method prescribed by ASC 842 - Lease Accounting. The Company assess whether the contract is, or contains, a lease at the inception of a contract which is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Company allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on its relative stand-alone price to determine the lease payments. The Company has elected not to recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases that have a term of 12 months or less.\nOperating and financing lease ROU assets represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. Operating and financing lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the adoption date in determining the present value of future payments. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06-Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (ASU 2020-06) to simplify the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in Subtopic 470- 20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible instruments. Under the amendments in ASU 2020-06, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract for convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. Consequently, a convertible debt instrument will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and a convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. By removing those separation models, the interest rate of convertible debt instruments typically will be closer to the coupon interest rate when applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. The amendments in ASU 2020-06 provide financial statement users with a simpler and more consistent starting point to perform analyses across entities. The amendments also improve the operability of the guidance and reduce, to a large extent, the complexities in the accounting for convertible instruments and the difficulties with the interpretation and application of the relevant guidance. To further improve the decision usefulness and relevance of the information being provided to users of financial statements, amendments in ASU 2020-06 increased information transparency by making the following amendments to the disclosure for convertible instruments:\n1. Added a disclosure objective\n2. Added information about events or conditions that occur during the reporting period that cause conversion contingencies to be met or conversion terms to be significantly changed\n3. Added information on which party controls the conversion rights\n4. Aligned disclosure requirements for contingently convertible instruments with disclosure requirements for other convertible instruments\n5. Required that existing fair value disclosures in Topic 825, Financial Instruments, be provided at the individual convertible instrument level rather than in the aggregate.\nAdditionally, for convertible debt instruments with substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, amendments in ASU 2020-06 added disclosures about (1) the fair value amount and the level of fair value hierarchy of the entire instrument for public business entities and (2) the premium amount recorded as paid-in capital.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nThe amendments in ASU 2020-06 are effective for public business entities, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities should adopt the guidance as of the beginning of its annual fiscal year and are allowed to adopt the guidance through either a modified retrospective method of transition or a fully retrospective method of transition. In applying the modified retrospective method, entities should apply the guidance to transactions outstanding as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the amendments are adopted. Transactions that were settled (or expired) during prior reporting periods are unaffected. The cumulative effect of the change should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of adoption. If an entity elects the fully retrospective method of transition, the cumulative effect of the change should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the first comparative period presented. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 and its adoption did not have any material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuers accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted ASU 2020-06 and its adoption did not have any material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARIES\nAdministrative Dissolution of OncBioMune, LLC\nOn July 11, 2021, the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary OncBioMune, LLC was administratively dissolved by the Louisiana Secretary of State for failing to meet its filing requirements and pay the associated fees (see Note 1).

The holders of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock have the following preferences and rights:\nOn June 9, 2021, the Company filed an Amendment (the CoD Amendment) to the Series C-1 Certificate of Designation with the Nevada Secretary of State. The filing of the CoD Amendment was approved by the Board on June 8, 2021, and by the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock on June 8, 2021.\nThe CoD Amendment sets the triggering price for the anti-dilution price protection at $0.00275 per share, the same price as the Series C-2 Certificate of Designation. All other terms of the Series C-1 Certificate of Designation remain unchanged and in full force and effect.\n\u25cf Holders of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends or distributions on each share on an as converted into common stock basis, if, as and when declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.\n\u25cf Each share of Series C-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the Initial Issuance Date at a conversion price of $0.0275 per share. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by dividing (x) the conversion amount (determined by the sum of the stated value thereof plus any additional amount thereon which consist of all dividends, whether declared or not) of such share of Series C-1 by (y) the conversion price of $0.0275 per share (subject to temporary adjustment upon a triggering event as defined by the Series C-1 Certificate of Designation, to 80% of the conversion price). The adjusted conversion price is only in effect until the triggering event is cured. The convertibility of shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock is limited such that a holder of Series C-1 Preferred Stock may not convert Series C-1 Preferred Stock to common stock to the extent that the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to such conversion, when aggregated with all other shares of common stock owned by the holder at such time, would result in the holder beneficially owning (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) more than 4.99% of all of the Companys common stock outstanding.\n\u25cf In the event the Company issues or sells any securities including options or convertible securities, except for any Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Series C-1 Certificate of Designation), at a price of or with an exercise price or conversion price of less than $0.0275 per share (see amendment discussed above), then upon such issuance or sale, the Series C-1 Preferred Stock conversion price shall be reduced to the sale price, the exercise price or conversion price of the securities sold. In addition, these preferred shareholders have the right to participate in future equity offerings from the company for twenty-four months from the effective date.\n\u25cf In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of the Company, the holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in cash out of the assets of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (Liquidation Funds) before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock (as defined in the Series C-1 Certificate of Designation) then outstanding, an amount per shares of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (A) the conversion amount thereof on the date of such payment or (B) the amount per share such holder of Series C-1 Preferred Stock would receive if such holder converted such Series C-1 into common stock immediately prior to the date of the payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and holders of the shares of Parity Stock, then each holder of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of the Liquidation Funds payable to such holder of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and such holder of the Parity Stock as a liquidation preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designation (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of Series C-1 Preferred Stock and all holders of Parity Stock.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, various holders of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock converted an aggregate of 1,923 shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock into 288,637,529 shares of the Companys common stock (see below - Common Stock Issued Upon Conversion of Series C-1 Preferred Stock).\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 1,043 and 2,966 shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, respectively.\nSeries C-2 Preferred Stock\nOn May 18, 2020, the Company filed a certificate of designation, preferences and rights of Series C-2 Preferred Stock (the Series C-2 Certificate of Designation) with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 6,000 shares of its previously authorized preferred stock as Series C-2 Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and a stated value of $410.27 per share. The Series C-2 Certificate of Designation and its filing was approved by the Companys Board of Directors without shareholder approval as provided for in the Companys articles of incorporation and under Nevada law. The holders of shares of Series C-2 Preferred Stock have the following preferences and rights:\n\u25cf Holders of shares of Series C-2 Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends or distributions on each share on an as converted into common stock basis, if, as and when declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.\n\u25cf Each share of Series C-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the initial issuance date at a conversion price of $0.00275 per share. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by dividing (x) the conversion amount (determined by the sum of the stated value thereof plus any additional amount thereon) of such share of Series C-2 by (y) the conversion price of $0.00275 per share (subject to temporary adjustment upon a triggering event as defined by the Series C-2 Certificate of Designation to 80% of the conversion price). The adjusted conversion price is only in effect until the triggering event is cured. The convertibility of shares of Series C-2 Preferred Stock is limited such that a holder of Series C-2 Preferred Stock may not convert Series C-2 Preferred Stock to common stock to the extent that the number of shares of common stock to be issued pursuant to such conversion, when aggregated with all other shares of common stock owned by the holder at such time, would result in the holder beneficially owning (as determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) more than 4.99% of all of the Companys common stock outstanding.\n\u25cf In the event the Company issues or sells any securities including options or convertible securities, except for any Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Series C-2 Certificate of Designation), at a price of or with an exercise price or conversion price of less than the conversion price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Series C-2 Preferred Stock conversion price shall be reduced to the sale price, the exercise price or conversion price of the securities sold. In addition, these preferred shareholders have the right to participate in future equity offerings from the company for twenty-four months from the effective date.\n\u25cf In the event of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of the Company, the holders of the Series C-2 Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, in cash out of the Liquidation Funds before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock (as defined in the Series C-2 Certificate of Designation) then outstanding, an amount per shares of the Series C-2 Preferred Stock equal to the greater of (A) the conversion amount thereof on the date of such payment or (B) the amount per share such holder would receive if such holder converted such Series C-2 into common stock immediately prior to the date of the payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due to the holders of Series C-2 Preferred Stock and holders of the shares of Parity Stock, then each holder of Series C-2 Preferred Stock and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of the Liquidation Funds payable to such holder of Series C-2 Preferred Stock and such holder of the Parity Stock as a liquidation preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designation (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to all holders of Series C-2 Preferred Stock and all holders of Parity Stock.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, a holder of the Series C-2 Preferred Stock converted 1,880 shares of Series C-1 Preferred Stock into 280,475,491 shares of the Companys common stock (see below - Common Stock Issued Upon Conversion of Series C-2 Preferred Stock).\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 3,037 and 4,917 shares of Series C-2 Preferred Stock, respectively, issued and outstanding.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nSeries E Preferred Stock\nOn September 15, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series E Preferred Stock (the Series E Certificate of Designation) with the Nevada Secretary of the State to designate 2,000 shares of its previously authorized preferred stock as Series E Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and a stated value of $2,000 per share. The Series E Certificate of Designation and its filing were approved by the Companys Board of Directors without stockholder approval as provided for in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and under Nevada law. The holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock have the following preferences and rights:\n\u25cf From the initial issuance date, cumulative dividends on each share of Series E shall accrue, on a quarterly basis in arrears (with any partial quarter calculated on a pro-rata basis), at the rate of 8% per annum on the stated value, plus any additional amount thereon. Dividends shall be paid within 15 days after the end of each fiscal quarter (Dividend Payment Date), at the option of the Holder in cash or through the issuance of shares of common stock. In the event that the Holder elects to receive its dividends in shares of common stock the number of shares of common stock to be issued to each applicable Holder shall be determined by dividing the total dividend outstanding to such Holder by the average closing price of the common stock during the five trading days on the principal market prior to the dividend payment date.\n\u25cf Holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends or distributions on each share on an as converted into common stock basis, if, as and when declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.\n\u25cf Each share of Series E Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the initial issuance date at the conversion price which is the lesser of: (i) $0.00375 or (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the common stock during the prior five trading days on the principal market, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series E Certificate of Designation including a price protection provision for offerings below the conversion price, provided, however, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0021. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stated value per share of $2,000 plus accrued dividends and dividing that number by the conversion price.\n\u25cf In connection with, (i) a Change of Control of the Company or (ii) on the closing of, a Qualified Public Offering by the Company, all of the outstanding shares of Series E (including any fraction of a share) shall automatically convert into an aggregate number of shares of common stock (including any fraction of a share) by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stated value per share of $2,000 plus accrued dividends and dividing that number (including any fraction of a share) by the lesser of: (i) $0.00375 or (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the common stock during the prior five trading days on the principal market, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series E Certificate of Designation including a price protection provision for offerings below the conversion price. However, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0021. If a closing of a Change of Control transaction or a Qualified Public Offering occurs, such automatic conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series E shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or Qualified Public Offering.\n\u25cf In the event the Company issues or sells any securities including options or convertible securities, except for any Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Series E Certificate of Designation), at a price, an exercise price or conversion price of less than the conversion price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Series E Preferred Stock conversion price shall be reduced to the sale price or the exercise price or conversion price of the securities sold.\n\u25cf Holders of Series E Preferred Stock have no voting rights.\nOn September 16, 2020, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA) with an affiliated investor, who is a beneficial shareholder, to purchase an aggregate amount of 1,000 shares of the newly created Series E Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company (the Series E Preferred) for an aggregate investment amount of $2,000,000.\nPursuant to the Series E Certificate of Designation, Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the holder in the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of common stock to a holder upon any conversion due to insufficient shares of common stock available (Authorized Failure Shares) and therefore meets the criteria of a contingently redeemable instrument in accordance with ASC 480-10-25-7 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Series E Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the issuers control and is classified as temporary equity pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99.\nFurther the Series E Preferred Stock is an equity host instrument since it has more features that align with an equity instrument than a debt instrument pursuant to ASC 815-15-25-17A - Derivatives and Hedging, which states in part that the nature of the host contract depends on the economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid financial instrument. All of the contractual and implied terms of the preferred share, such as the existence of a redemption feature or conversion option, should be considered when determining the nature of the host instrument as debt or equity. The Series E Preferred Stock embedded conversion feature (call option) is considered clearly and closely related to the equity host. Accordingly, further analysis under ASC 815-40-15 is not necessary and the embedded conversion feature should not be bifurcated from the host instrument. The Series E Preferred Stock redemption feature (put option) does not meet all the criteria under ASC 815-10-15-83, therefore it does not qualify as a derivative.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nTo determine whether the Series E Preferred Stock contains a BCF, we compared the effective conversion price and the Companys stock price on the commitment date. The effective conversion price was calculated by dividing the proceeds from Series E Preferred Stock by the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock. The BCF is measured as the difference between the commitment date stock price and the effective conversion price multiplied by the number of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series E. The BCF is limited to the total cash proceeds received if the amount of the BCF exceeds the cash proceeds received. In connection with the issuance of Series E Preferred Stock, during the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recognized a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of $2,000,000 which was accounted for as a deemed dividend.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock triggered the price protection clause in the Series E Preferred Stock. Thus, the conversion price of the Series E Preferred Stock was reduced from $0.00375 to $0.00313 on that date.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company incurred $160,000 and $159,890 of Series E dividends. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, dividend payable balances were $40,329 and $13,151, respectively, reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as accrued liabilities instead of temporary equity.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 1,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued and outstanding classified as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheets.\nSeries F Preferred Stock\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights of Series F Preferred Stock (the Series F Certificate of Designation), with the Nevada Secretary of State to designate 1,000 shares of its previously authorized preferred stock as Series F Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share and a stated value of $2,000 per share. The Series F Certificate of Designation and its filing were approved by the Companys Board of Directors without stockholder approval as provided for in the Companys Articles of Incorporation and under Nevada law. The holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock have the following preferences and rights:\n\u25cf From the Initial Issuance Date, cumulative dividends on each share of Series F shall accrue, on a monthly basis in arrears (with any partial month being made on a pro-rata basis), at the rate of 8% per annum on the stated value, plus any additional amount thereon. Dividends shall be paid within 15 days after the end of each month (Dividend Payment Date), at the option of the Holder in cash or through the issuance of shares of common stock. In the event that the Holder elects to receive its dividends in shares of common stock the number of shares of common stock to be issued to each applicable Holder shall be determined by dividing the total dividend payable to such Holder by the average closing price of the common stock during the five trading days on the principal market prior to the dividend payment date.\n\u25cf Holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock are entitled to dividends or distributions on each share on an as converted into common stock basis, if, as and when declared from time to time by the Board of Directors.\n\u25cf Each share of Series F Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock any time after the initial issuance date at the conversion price which is the lesser of: (i) $0.00313 or (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the common stock during the prior five trading days on the principal market, subject to adjustment as provided in the Series F Certificate of Designation including a price protection provision for offerings below the conversion price, provided, however, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0016. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion shall be determined by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the stated value per share of $2,000 plus additional amount by the conversion price.\n\u25cf In connection with, (i) a Change of Control of the Company or (ii) on the closing of, a Qualified Public Offering by the Company, all of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock (including any fraction of a share) shall automatically convert along with the additional amount into an aggregate number of shares of common stock (including any fraction of a share) as is determined by dividing the number of shares of Series F Preferred Stock (including any fraction of a share) by the automatic conversion price then in effect. If a closing of a Change of Control transaction or a Qualified Public Offering occurs, such automatic conversion of all of the outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall be deemed to have been converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the closing of such transaction or Qualified Public Offering.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\n\u25cf In the event the Company issues or sells any securities including options or convertible securities, except for any Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Series F Certificate of Designation), at a price, an exercise price or conversion price of less than the conversion price, then upon such issuance or sale, the Series F Preferred Stock conversion price shall be reduced to the sale price, or the exercise price or conversion price of the securities sold.\n\u25cf Series F Preferred Stock shall rank pari passu with respect to the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company with the Series C-1 Preferred Stock of the Company, the Series C-2 Preferred Stock of the Company, and the Series E Preferred Stock of the Corporation (the Parity Stock), and all other shares of capital stock of the Company shall be junior in rank to all Series F shares with respect to the preferences as to dividends (except for the common stock, which shall be pari passu as provided in the Series F Certificate of Designation), distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company (such junior stock is referred to herein collectively as Junior Stock). The rights of all such Junior Stock shall be subject to the rights, powers, preferences and privileges of the Series F Preferred Stock. Without limiting any other provision of the Series F Certificate of Designation, without the prior express consent of the Required Holder, the Company shall not hereafter authorize or issue any additional or other shares of capital stock that is (i) of senior rank to the Series F Preferred Stock in respect of the preferences as to dividends, distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution and winding up of the Company (collectively, the Senior Preferred Stock), or (ii) Parity Stock. Except as provided for in the Certificate of Designation, in the event of the merger or consolidation of the Company into another corporation, the Series F Preferred Stock shall maintain their relative rights, powers, designations, privileges and preferences provided for in the Certificate of Designation for a period of at least two years following such merger or consolidation and no such merger or consolidation shall cause result inconsistent therewith.\nOn July 30, 2021, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the SPA) with an affiliated investor, who is a beneficial shareholder, to purchase an aggregate amount of 500 shares of Series F Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series F Preferred) with accompanying warrant for 63,897,764 of common stock (the Warrant), for total proceeds of $1,000,000 (see Note 9). The Series F Preferred Stock has a stated value of $2,000 per share and shall accrue monthly in arrears, dividends at the rate of 8% per annum on the stated value. The dividends shall be paid monthly at the option of the holder of the Series F Preferred in either cash or shares of common stock of the Company. The number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred is determined by dividing the stated value of the number of shares being converted, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends, by the lesser of: (i) $0.00313 and (ii) 75% of the average closing price of the Companys common stock during the prior five trading days; provided, however, the conversion price shall never be less than $0.0016. In addition, the investor was issued a Warrant to purchase an amount of common stock equal to 20% of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred at an exercise price of $0.00313 per share (subject to adjustment as provided therein) until July 30, 2026. The Warrants are exercisable for cash at any time. The 63,897,764 Warrant was valued using the relative fair value method at $957,192 and the Series F Preferred stock had a grant date fair value $42,808 which was recorded as a BCF.\nIn accordance with ASC 470 - Debt, the proceeds of $1,000,000 was allocated based on the relative fair values of the Series F preferred stock and the Warrant of $42,808 and $957,192, respectively. Although ASC 470 is for debt instruments issued with warrants, preferred shares issued with warrants should be accounted for in a similar manner.\nPursuant to the Series F Certificate of Designation, Series F Preferred Stock is redeemable at the option of the holder in the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing shares of common stock to a holder upon any conversion due to insufficient shares of common stock available (Authorized Failure Shares) and therefore meets the criteria of a contingently redeemable instrument in accordance with ASC 480-10-25-7 - Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. The Series F Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of an event that is outside of the issuers control and should be classified as temporary equity pursuant to ASC 480-10-S99.

The Series F Preferred Stock redemption feature (put option) does not meet all the criteria under ASC 815-10-15-83, therefore it does not qualify as a derivative.\nTo determine whether the Series F Preferred Stock contains a BCF, we compared the effective conversion price and the Companys stock price on the commitment date. The effective conversion price was calculated by dividing the proceeds from Series F Preferred Stock by the number of common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series F Preferred Stock. The BCF is measured as the difference between the commitment date stock price and the effective conversion price multiplied by the number of common stock issuable upon conversion of Series F. The BCF is limited to the total cash proceeds received if the amount of the BCF exceeds the cash proceeds received. In connection with the issuance of Series F Preferred Stock, during the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company recognized a BCF in the amount of $42,808 which was accounted for as a deemed dividend.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nThe relative fair value of the warrant of $957,192 was recorded as a discount associated with the Series F preferred stock and was fully amortized immediately because the Series F preferred stock was convertible on the date of issuance. The Company recorded the $957,192 as deemed dividend.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company also recorded dividends related to the Series F Preferred Stock in the amount of $80,000 and $6,728. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, dividend payable balances were $20,164 and $6,728, respectively, reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as accrued liabilities instead of temporary equity.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 500 shares of Series F Preferred Stock issued and outstanding classified as temporary equity in the accompanying balance sheets.\nCommon Stock\nCommon Stock Issued Upon Conversion of Series C-1 Preferred Stock\n\u25cf During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 288,637,529 shares of the Companys common stock to various investors upon their conversion of an aggregate of 1,923 shares of the Series C-1 Preferred Stock.\nCommon Stock Issued Upon Conversion of Series C-2 Preferred Stock\n\u25cf During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 280,575,491 shares of the Companys common stock to an investor upon conversion of 1,880 shares of the Series C-2 Preferred Stock.\nCommon Stock Issued Upon Accounts Payable Settlements\n\u25cf During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 26,913,738 shares of the Companys common stock to two consultants upon the close of their respective settlement agreements, dated October 18, 2021, to settle accounts payable balances in aggregate amount of $84,240 or $0.00313 per share, valued with the share price of common stock sold in private placements during the same period (see Note 11).\nCommon Stock Issued for Subscription Payable\n\u25cf During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 431,309,907 shares of the Companys common stock to various investors in connection with the subscription payable aggregate amount of $1,350,000.

The Company currently believes the likelihood of a loss contingency related to these matters is remote and, therefore, no provision for a loss contingency is required.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nOn August 16, 2022, Erika Singleton filed a complaint against the Company in the Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada, Case No. A-22-857038-C. Plaintiff alleges that the Company did not provide her with physical stock certificates for 200,000 shares of common stock Plaintiff purchased for $2,000 in 2017. Based on these and other allegations, Plaintiff asserts claims against the Company for breach of contract, violation of Florida securities law, fraud, and unjust enrichment. After recently resolving issues related to service, the Company is currently set to file its responsive pleading on or before January 6, 2023.\nNOTE 12 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company maintains deferred tax assets and liabilities that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The deferred tax assets on September 30, 2022 and 2021 consist of net operating loss carry-forwards. The net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the uncertainty of the attainment of future taxable income.\nThe items accounting for the difference between income taxes at the effective statutory rate and the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follow:\nSCHEDULE OF EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE\nYears Ended September 30,\nIncome tax benefit at U.S. statutory rate of 21%\u202f $ (2,675,812 ) $ (1,149,047 )\nIncome tax benefit - state (589,953 ) (253,337 )\nNon-deductible expenses 1,543,675 (52,467 )\nChange in valuation allowance 1,722,090 1,454,851\nTotal provision for income tax $ - $ -\nThe Companys approximate net deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 was as follow:\nSCHEDULE OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nYears Ended September 30,\nNet operating loss carry-forwards $ 12,967,136 $ 11,245,046\nTotal deferred tax asset 12,967,136 11,245,046\nLess: valuation allowance (12,967,136 ) (11,245,046 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nThe gross operating loss carry forward available to the Company was $50,593,585 on September 30, 2022. The Company provided a full valuation allowance equal to the net deferred income tax asset as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 because it was not known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize the loss carry-forwards. Additionally, the future utilization of the net operating loss carry-forwards to offset future taxable income is subject to annual limitations as a result of ownership or business changes that occurred prior to fiscal year 2022 and may occur in the future. The Company has not conducted a study to determine the limitations on the utilization of these net operating loss carry-forwards.\nThe increase in the valuation allowance was $1,722,090 in fiscal year 2022 and total net tax effected loss carry-forwards on September 30, 2022 was $12,967,136. The potential tax benefit arising from the loss carry-forward of approximately $8,050,201 accumulated through September 30, 2017, will expire in 2037. The potential tax benefit arising from the net operating loss carry-forward of $4,916,935 occurred after the effective date of the current tax act and can be carried forward indefinitely within the annual usage limitations.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nNOTE 13 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nPrivate Placement Offering\nOn November 29, 2022, the Company consummated the initial closing (the Initial Closing) of a private placement offering (the Offering) pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement, dated as of November 29, 2022 (the Purchase Agreement), by and among the Company, certain accredited investors (the Purchasers) and Cavalry Fund I Management LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, in its capacity as collateral agent (the Collateral Agent). At the Initial Closing, the Company sold the Purchasers (i) 10% Original Issue Discount Senior Secured Convertible Debentures (the Debentures) in an aggregate principal amount of $3,355,000 and (ii) warrants (the Warrants and together with the Debentures, the Underlying Securities) to purchase up to 958,571,426 shares of common stock of the Company (the Common Stock), subject to adjustments provided by the Warrants, which represents 100% warrant coverage. The Company received a total of $2,639,000 in net proceeds at the Initial Offering, net of the Original Issue Discount of $305,000, commissions of $305,000 and other offering costs of $106,000. The company also incurred offering costs of $27,270 which were reflected as deferred offering costs as of September 30, 2022. In November 2022, additional offering costs of $32,000 were incurred.\nThe Company may hold one or more subsequent closings at any time prior to December 31, 2022, unless otherwise extended, to sell additional Underlying Securities in an aggregate principal amount up to $6,600,000, which may be adjusted upward to mean an aggregate principal amount of $8,000,000 upon written consent of the Company and the Placement Agent (as defined below).\nThe Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants of the Company, including, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict the ability of the Company without the prior written consent of the Debenture holders, to incur additional indebtedness, and repay outstanding indebtedness, create or permit liens on assets, redeem its Common Stock, settle outstanding litigation, or enter into transactions with affiliates.\nIn connection with the Initial Closing, the Company and Joseph Gunnar & Co. LLC, a U.S. registered broker-dealer (Gunnar), entered into a placement agency agreement (the Placement Agency Agreement), pursuant to which Gunnar agreed to act as the placement agent for the Offering (the Placement Agent). Pursuant to the terms of the Placement Agency Agreement, the Company agreed to (i) pay Gunnar a cash placement fee of 10% of the gross cash proceeds raised in the Offering, and (ii) issue to Gunnar warrants (the PA Warrants) on the terms identical to the Warrants sold in the Offering in an amount equal to 10% of the Underlying Securities sold to investors.\nAs a result of the foregoing, the Company paid Gunnar an aggregate commission of $305,000 in connection with the Initial Closing. The Company also paid $50,000 in fees to Gunnars legal counsel and paid Gunnar a financial advisory fee of $50,000. In addition, Gunner received 124,489,795 warrants.\nEach investor in any subsequent closing will be required to represent that, at the time of the applicable closing, it is an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) and that there was no general solicitation or advertising in connection with the Offering.\nDebentures\nThe Debentures mature on November 29, 2023, subject to a three-month extension at the sole discretion of the Company. The Debentures bear interest at 10% per annum payable upon conversion or maturity. The Debentures are convertible into shares of Common Stock at any time after the maturity date and prior to Mandatory Conversion (as defined below) at the conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $0.003 per share and (ii) 70% of the average of the VWAP (as defined in the Debentures) (or 50% of the average of such VWAP if an event of default has occurred and has not been cured) of the Common Stock during the ten Trading Day (as defined in the Debentures) period immediately prior to the applicable conversion date. The Debentures are subject to mandatory conversion (Mandatory Conversion) in the event the Company closes a registered public offering of its Common Stock and receives gross proceeds of not less than $5,000,000, with such offering resulting in the listing for trading of the Common Stock on a national exchange (Qualified Offering). The conversion price per share of Common Stock in the case of a Mandatory Conversion shall be the lesser of (i) $0.003 per share and (ii) 70% of the offering price per share in the Qualified Offering (the Qualified Offering Price). Alternatively, upon a Mandatory Conversion, the holders of the Debentures may elect to exchange their Debentures for newly issued convertible preferred securities at a price per share equal to the Qualified Offering Price or the five-day VWAP of the Common Stock prior to the date that is 181 days after the closing of the Qualified Offering.\nNotwithstanding the preceding, holders of Debentures shall have the right to require satisfaction of up to 40% of all amounts outstanding under the Debentures, in cash, at the time of a Qualified Financing. The Debentures also contain certain price protection provisions providing for adjustment of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures in case of certain future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends.\nTHERALINK TECHNOLOGIES, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2022 AND 2021\nWarrants\nThe Warrants are exercisable for five years and six months from the earlier of the maturity date of the Debentures and the closing of the Qualified Financing, at an exercise price equal to (i) in the event that a Qualified Offering is consummated prior to the exercise of the Warrant, the price per share at which the Qualified Offering is made (Qualified Offering Price), or (ii) in the event that no Qualified Offering has been consummated, the lower of: (A) $0.003 per share and (B) an amount equal to 70% of the average of the VWAP (or 50% of the average of the VWAP if an event of default has occurred and has not been cured) for the Common Stock over the ten Trading Days preceding the date of the delivery of the applicable exercise notice. If there is no effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares underlying the Warrants within 180 days following the closing of the Qualified Offering: (i) exercise may be via cashless exercise, and (ii) 5% additional Warrants will be issued by the Company to the holders for any portion of each month without such effective registration statement.\nThe Warrants contain certain price protection provisions providing for adjustment of the amount of securities issuable upon exercise of the Warrants in case of certain future dilutive events or stock-splits and dividends.\nSecurity Agreement and Exchanges\nThe Companys obligations under the Purchase Agreement, the Debentures and the Exchanged Debentures (defined below) are secured by a first priority lien on all of the assets of the Company pursuant to that certain Security Agreement, dated November 29, 2022 (the Security Agreement) by and among the Company, the Purchasers and the Collateral Agent. To incentivize the existing convertible noteholders and holders of convertible preferred stock to convert their Existing Securities (see Note 7 and Note 10), the Company issued a new convertible note for $200,000 to an existing investor for the settlement of claims in October 2022 and then increased the principal amount and accrued interest payable on convertible notes and the stated value and accrued dividends payable on convertible preferred stock by 15%. Accordingly, in connection with this Offering, holders of existing convertible notes and the related accrued interest payable aggregating $7,119,125 was increased to $8,186,994 and a portion of shares of a convertible Series C-1, and all shares of Series C-2 Series E and Series F preferred stock of the Company with an aggregate stated value and accrued dividends payable of $8,068,915 was decreased to $5,425,911, and the holder of the convertible notes and preferred stockholders (the Existing Securities) agreed pursuant to an agreement with the Company to convert the Existing Securities into an aggregate of approximately $13.6 million of debentures (Exchanged Debentures) and warrants (representing 100% coverage of their original investment amount). Such Exchanged Debentures have the same terms as the Debentures described above, except that the holders are only entitled to repayment in cash of up to 10% of their outstanding amounts upon a Qualified Financing. Upon the closing of the Offering, only 141.5033 C-1 convertible preferred shares remained outstanding. All the other convertible preferred shares were converted into convertible debentures during the Offering.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Underlying Securities discussed above, the Company determined that the terms of the Debentures and Warrants contain an embedded conversion option to be accounted for as derivative liabilities due to the holder having the potential to gain value upon conversion and provisions which includes events not within the control of the Company. In accordance with ASC 815-40 -Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in an Entitys Own Stock, the embedded conversion option contained in the Debentures and the Warrants shall be accounted for as derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and shall be adjusted to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. The fair value of the embedded conversion options will be determined using the Binomial Lattice valuation model. At the end of each period and on Debenture conversion date or repayment, the Company revalues the derivative liabilities resulting from the embedded option.\nEmployment Agreement\nOn December 5, 2022, the Company appointed Faith Zaslavsky, age 48, as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, effective December 5, 2022 (the Effective Date). In connection with her appointment, on December 5, 2022, the Company and Ms. Zaslavsky entered into an offer letter (the Offer Letter) which provides that Ms. Zaslavskys base salary will be $400,000 per year, and that beginning in calendar year 2023 she will be eligible to receive an annual incentive cash bonus of up to 35% of base salary at the discretion of the Board for the achievement of certain milestones to be agreed upon by Ms. Zaslavsky and the Company within 90 days of the Effective Date.

The employee stock options will have a strike price equal to the closing price of the Companys common stock on the day that the Board approves Ms. Zaslavskys stock option package. Ms. Zaslavsky is eligible to participate in the benefit plans and programs generally available to the Companys employees. Ms. Zaslavsky will also be entitled to reimbursement of reasonable business expenses incurred or paid by her in the performance of her duties and responsibilities for the Company, subject to any restrictions set by the Company from time to time and to such reasonable substantiation and documentation as may be specified by the Company from time to time. Ms. Zaslavskys employment with the Company is at-will, and either party can terminate the employment relationship at any time, for or without cause, with or without notice. The Offer Letter also contains standard restrictive covenants prohibiting Ms. Zaslavsky from engaging in competition with the Company within the United States during her employment and for a period of 24 months following the termination of her employment with the Company.\nCFO Bonus Compensation Plan\nOn December 6, 2022, the Board approved a bonus compensation plan pursuant to which Thomas E.
