    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nOVERVIEW\nDolby Laboratories creates audio and imaging technologies that transform entertainment for content playback in movies, TV, music, gaming and user-generated content. Founded in 1965, our strengths stem from expertise in analog and digital signal processing and digital compression technologies that have transformed the ability of artists to convey entertainment experiences to their audiences through recorded media. Such technologies led to the development of our noise-reduction systems for analog tape recordings, and have since evolved into multiple offerings that enable more immersive sound for cinema, DTV transmissions and devices, mobile devices, OTT video and music services, home entertainment devices, and automobiles.\nToday, we derive the majority of our revenue from licensing our audio technologies. We also derive revenue from licensing our consumer imaging technologies, as well as audio and imaging technologies for premium cinema offerings in collaboration with exhibitors. In addition to our licensing business, we provide products and services for a variety of applications in the cinema and broadcast markets, and offer solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement.\nOUR STRATEGY\nKey elements of our strategy include:\nAdvancing the Science of Sight and Sound. We apply our understanding of the human senses, audio, and imaging engineering to develop technologies aimed at improving how people experience and interact with their entertainment content.\nProviding Creative Solutions. We promote the use of our solutions as creative tools, and provide our products, services, and technologies to filmmakers, musical artists, sound mixers, and other content creators and providers. Our tools help showcase the quality and impact of their efforts and intent, which in turn may generate market demand.\nDelivering Superior Experiences. Our technologies and solutions optimize playback so that users may enjoy richer, clearer, and more immersive sound and sight experiences.\nExpanding the Reach of our Technologies. We look for new and innovative ways to expand the reach of our technologies to new content, media, devices and audiences. For example, we are expanding our addressable market to enhance a broader range of content, by offering solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Our solution provides the capability to stream high quality audiovisual content in ultra-low latency which reduces the delay between the action and the viewer. Everyone experiencing the action at the same time enables ways to interact with the content.\nREVENUE GENERATION\nThe following table presents a summary of the composition of our revenue for all periods presented. Refer to Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" and Note 3 \"Revenue Recognition\" for further detail.\nFiscal Year Ended\nRevenue September 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nLicensing 92% 93% 95%\nProducts and services 8% 7% 5%\nTotal 100% 100% 100%\nWe generate revenue from licensing arrangements with approximately 500 electronics product OEM and software developer licensees.\nLicensing\nWe license our technologies to a range of customers who incorporate them into their products for enhanced audio and imaging functionality for content playback in movies, TV, music, and gaming. Our key technologies are summarized in the table below. As it relates to AAC, HE-AAC, Extended HE-AAC, AVC, and HEVC, we jointly participate in patent licensing programs with other patent owners.\nTechnology Description\nAAC, HE-AAC and Extended HE-AAC Advanced digital audio codec solutions with high bandwidth efficiency used for a wide range of media applications.\nAVC A digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency used in a wide range of media devices.\nDolby AC-4 A next-generation digital audio coding technology that increases transmission efficiency while delivering new audio experiences, including Dolby Atmos, to a wide range of playback devices.\nDolby Atmos An object-oriented audio technology for cinema and a wide range of media devices that allows sound to be precisely placed and moved anywhere in the listening environment including the overhead dimension.

Most of our consumer entertainment licensing business consists of a two-tier licensing model whereby our decoding technologies, included in reference software and firmware code, are first provided under license to semiconductor manufacturers whom we refer to as \"implementation licensees.\" Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies in ICs which they sell to OEMs of consumer entertainment products, whom we refer to as \"system licensees.\" System licensees separately obtain licenses from us that allow them to make and sell end-user products using ICs that incorporate our technologies.\nImplementation licensees incorporate our technologies into their chipsets that, once approved by Dolby, are available for purchase from implementation licensees by OEMs for use in end-user products. Implementation licensees only pay us a nominal initial fee on contract execution as consideration for the ongoing services that we provide to assist in their implementation process. Revenue from these initial fees is recognized ratably over the contractual term as a component of licensing revenue.\nSystem licensees provide us with prototypes of products, or self-test results of products that incorporate our technologies. Upon our confirmation that our technologies are optimally and consistently incorporated, the system licensee may buy ICs under a license for the same Dolby technology from our network of implementation licensees, and may further sell approved products to retailers, distributors, and consumers. For the use of our technologies, our system licensees pay an initial licensing fee as well as royalties, which represent the majority of the revenue recognized from these arrangements. The amount of royalties we collect on a particular product depends on several factors including the nature of the implementation, the mix of Dolby technologies used, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped by the system licensee.\nIntegrated Licensing Model. We also license our technologies to software operating system vendors and to certain other OEMs that act as combined implementation and system licensees. These licensees incorporate our technologies in their software used on PCs, in mobile applications, or in ICs they manufacture and incorporate into their products. As with the two-tier licensing model, the combined implementation and system licensee pays us an initial licensing fee in addition to royalties as determined by the mix of Dolby technologies used, the nature of the\nimplementations, and the volume of products using our technologies that are shipped, and is subject to the same quality control evaluation process.\nPatent Licensing Model. We license our patents directly to manufacturers that use our IP in their products. We also license our patents through patent pools which are arrangements between multiple patent owners to jointly offer and license pooled patents to licensees who use our IP in their products. By aggregating and offering pooled patents, these arrangements deliver efficiencies that reduce transactional costs for both IP owners and licensees. Patent pools enable product manufacturers to efficiently and transparently secure patent licenses for collaboratively developed technologies. We offer our patents related to AAC, HE-AAC, Extended HE-AAC, AVC, HEVC, VVC and other standardized technologies through a combination of patent pools and licensing directly to OEMs. Finally, Via LA (as defined below) generates fees for administering patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners. See Note 15 \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the recent business combination involving Via LA.\nRecoveries. Licensing revenue recognized in any given period may include revenue from licensees and/or settlements with third parties where the use of our technology occurred in previous periods. Within the Results of Operations section of Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\" revenue attributable to previous periods' usage including settlements are collectively referred to as \"recoveries.\" Such recoveries have become a recurring element of our business and are particularly subject to fluctuation and unpredictability.\nCollaboration Arrangements\nDolby Cinema: We partner with exhibitors to deliver a premium cinema offering with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos at new and pre-existing venues. We receive revenue at Dolby Cinema sites through a share of box office receipts, which is recognized as licensing revenue.\nProducts\nWe design and manufacture audio and imaging hardware and software products for the cinema, television, broadcast, and entertainment industries. Distributed in approximately 90 countries, these products are used in content creation, distribution, and playback to enhance image and sound quality, and improve transmission and playback. Additionally, some of our Dolby Cinema arrangements are classified as sales-type leases, and as a result are included in products sales.\nKey products from which we generate products revenue are summarized in the table below:\nProduct Description\nCinema Cinema Imaging Products Digital Cinema Servers used to load, store, decrypt, decode, watermark, and playback digital film files for presentation on digital cinema projectors and software used to encrypt, encode, and package digital media files for distribution\nCinema Audio Products Cinema Processors, amplifiers, and loudspeakers used to decode, render, and optimally play back digital cinema soundtracks, including those using Dolby Atmos\nOther Other Products 3-D glasses and kits, broadcast hardware and software used to encode, transmit, and decode multiple channels of high-quality audio for DTV and HDTV distribution, monitors, and accessibility solutions for hearing and visually impaired consumers\nServices\nWe offer solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Over time, we expect to significantly expand the amount and types of content that can be enhanced through our technologies and capabilities.\nIn addition, we offer various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment, including equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, as well as audio, color, and light image calibration. We also provide PCS for products sold and equipment installed at Dolby Cinema theaters operated by exhibitor partners and support the implementation of our technologies into products manufactured by our licensees.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe have a substantial base of IP assets, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets developed based on our technical expertise.\nAs of September 29, 2023, we had approximately 19,300 issued patents and approximately 1,900 pending patent applications in more than 100 jurisdictions throughout the world. Our currently issued patents expire at various times through September 2045.\nSome of our patents relating to DD technologies have expired, and others will expire over the next several years. While in the past we derived a significant portion of our licensing revenue from our DD technologies, this is no longer the case as revenue attributed to DD technologies has declined and is expected to continue to decline. The primary products where DD is widely used include automotive, TVs, and soundbars. We have transitioned a number of our DD licensees to DD+ technologies, an extension of our DD technologies, whose patents generally expire later than the DD patents.\nWe pursue a general practice of filing patent applications for our technologies in the United States (\"U.S.\") and foreign countries where our customers manufacture, distribute, or sell licensed products. We actively pursue new applications to expand our patent portfolio to address new technological innovations, and we also make strategic acquisitions of technology and patents from time to time. We have multiple patents covering aspects and improvements for many of our technologies.\nWe have approximately 1,600 trademark registrations throughout the world for a variety of wordmarks, logos, and slogans. Our trademarks cover our various products, technologies, improvements, and features, as well as the services that we provide. These trademarks are an integral part of our technology licensing program, and licensees typically elect to place our trademarks on their products to inform consumers that their products incorporate our technology and meet our quality specifications.\nWe protect our IP rights both domestically and internationally. From time to time, OEMs have failed to report or have underreported shipments of their products that incorporate our technologies. We have also had problems with implementation licensees selling ICs with our technologies to third parties that are not system licensees. We anticipate that such problems will continue to occur. Accordingly, we have taken steps in the past to enforce our IP rights and expect to continue doing so in the future.\nMoreover, in certain countries, we have relatively few or no issued patents. For example, in some African and Central and South American countries, we have only limited patent protection for our technologies. Consequently, we may realize less revenue from those regions in the future. Maintaining or growing our licensing revenue in developing countries will depend in part on whether we obtain patent rights in those countries, which is uncertain. Further, because of the limitations of the legal systems in many countries, the effectiveness of patents obtained or that may in the future be obtained is uncertain.\nINDUSTRY STANDARDS\nSeveral Dolby technologies have been adopted as, or are included in, the explicit or de facto industry standard for broadcast, discrete media, and online delivery in various markets worldwide.\nExplicit industry standards are adopted through a standardization process whereby government entities, industry standards-setting bodies, trade associations, and others evaluate and then prescribe the use of a technology. For example, as global broadcast standards for digital, HD, and UHD television have developed, Dolby audio technologies have been adopted or mandated in various regions of the world, highlights of which are as follows:\nDD+ and HE-AAC are mandated for use in terrestrial broadcast across many countries including France, Italy, the United Kingdom (\"U.K.\"), Sweden, Germany, Poland, Turkey, and Russia. In addition, DD+ and HE-AAC are included in the digital terrestrial television specifications of emerging digital TV markets in Africa, Brazil, South-East Asia, and India while operators in China have selected DD and DD+ as optional technologies for transmissions using the countrys digital terrestrial television specification.\nDD is mandated for HD broadcast in multiple regions including North America and South Korea, and for DVD players on a global basis.\nAC-4 is Dolbys audio coding technology that has been adopted for implementation for next generation broadcast services in certain regions by worldwide standards organizations including the DVB and ATSC. In Europe, AC-4 has been mandated in next generation broadcast specifications for Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Poland and Sweden, and is also included in the specification for the new UHD terrestrial TV platform issued by regulator ARCOM in France. In North America, AC-4 is mandated for TVs for the NextGen TV over-the-air broadcast platform, based on ATSC3.0. The adoption of AC-4\ncontinues to grow, and AC-4 is already widely supported in UHDTVs available worldwide from major manufacturers.\nIn mobile devices, HE-AAC v2 (3GPP eAAC+) is specified for various applications in the 3rd Generation Partnership Project suite of standards.\nExtended HE-AAC is included in Digital Radio Mondiale radio broadcasting standards.\nIn addition, Dolby technologies have become, or are included in, de facto industry standards in many consumer entertainment products. De facto industry standards are adopted by industry participants when technologies are introduced to the marketplace and become widely used, and include the following examples:\nPrior to the adoption of HD terrestrial broadcast standards mandating Dolby technologies, many European HD broadcasters began broadcasting in DD or DD+, leading OEMs to include these technologies in their televisions and STBs for the European market.\nHE-AAC is a de facto audio standard in entertainment services. It is included in popular operating systems and widely used by major broadcasting, streaming, and radio services.\nDD+ is the de facto technology used by a wide range of pay-TV operators and streaming services worldwide and is included in popular operating systems such as iOS and Windows. It is also widely used by major OTT services such as Apple TV+, Disney+, Netflix, and Amazon, and is included in the specifications of these services.\nExtended HE-AAC is a de facto industry standard in streaming applications. It is included in popular operating systems and used in major OTT services.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nWe conduct R&D activities at numerous locations in the U.S. and internationally. Dolbys history of producing innovative technology has created many forms of IP. This IP generates licensing revenue that enables us to fund and pursue further innovation.\nThe majority of our R&D resources are focused on developing leading audio and imaging technologies for consumer entertainment. Each of these technologies can support many offerings, and we anticipate bringing new innovations to market in the future.\nPRODUCT MANUFACTURING\nOur product quality is enabled through the use of well-established, and in some cases, highly automated, assembly processes along with rigorous testing of our products. We rely primarily upon contract manufacturers for the majority of our production capacity. We purchase components and fabricated parts from multiple suppliers; however, we rely on sole source suppliers for certain components used to manufacture our products. We source components and fabricated parts both domestically and internationally.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nOur marketing efforts focus on demonstrating how our solutions improve entertainment experiences. We sell our solutions primarily using an internal sales organization to various customers in the markets where we operate. We also license our technologies and IP indirectly through patent pools, where owners of IP covering technology standards aggregate their patents and offer the pooled patents to implementers through patent pool licensing administrators who are responsible for the sales and marketing of the pooled patents. We promote our solutions and our brand through industry events such as trade-shows, film festivals, movie premieres, product launches, as well as through our website, public relations, direct marketing, co-marketing programs, and social media. In addition, we hold the naming rights to the Dolby Theatre, home to the Academy Awards\u00ae in Hollywood, California, where we showcase our technology and host high-profile events. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos. We maintain more than 20 sales offices in key regions around the globe.\nCUSTOMERS\nWe license our technologies to a broad set of customers that operate in a wide range of industries, and we sell our professional products either directly to the end user or, more commonly, through dealers and distributors. Users of\nour professional products and services include film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers.\nCOMPETITION\nThe entertainment industry are highly competitive, and we face aggressive competition in all areas of our business. Some of our current and future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. In addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated systems in certain markets for entertainment technologies, including audio and imaging, which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire obsolete. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany products that include our audio and imaging technologies also include technologies developed by our competitors. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include some or all of the following:\nDegree of access and inclusion in industry standards;\nTechnological performance, flexibility, and range of application;\nBrand recognition and reputation;\nTimeliness and relevance of new product introductions;\nQuality and reliability of products and services;\nRelationships with producers, directors, and distributors in the film and television industry, with television broadcast industry leaders, with OTT industry leaders, and with the management of semiconductor and CE OEMs;\nAvailability of compatible high quality audio and video content; and\nPrice.\nCertain foreign governments, particularly in China, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for IP, which can impact the licensing fees that we are able to collect. The regulatory enforcement activities in such jurisdictions can be unpredictable, in some cases because these jurisdictions have only recently implemented competition laws.\nOur technologies, products, and services span the audio and imaging sectors of several distinct and diverse industries, including the broadcast, mobile, consumer entertainment, PC, gaming, automotive, cinema, and other industries. The lack of a clear definition of the markets in which our products, services, and technologies are sold or licensed, the nature of our technologies, their potential use for various commercial applications, and the diverse nature of and lack of detailed reporting by our competitors, make it impracticable to quantify our position.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nAt Dolby, we strive to act as a good partner to our customers, employees, shareholders, and communities. We are committed to fostering a workplace environment in which every employee can contribute their fullest potential and make a positive impact through their roles.\nDetails of this work are available in our Sustainability Report, and we encourage you to read it on our website and learn more. Nothing in our Sustainability Report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs of September 29, 2023, we had 2,246 employees worldwide, of whom 1,060 employees were based outside of the U.S. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.\nEmployee Well-being\nOur workforce strategies prioritize employee well-being and take an integrated approach to mental, physical, and financial well-being for our employees. We have expanded our well-being programs to include therapy and access to wellness coaching, mindfulness training and live community sessions.\nWe continue to implement business strategies that support the health and safety of our employees and enable business continuity. We have implemented a flex work program that enables employee connection and effective work delivery globally. In a company-wide survey in May 2023, Motivation & Commitment scores indicate that we remain highly connected to our work and each other.\nDiversity, Inclusion and Belonging (\"DIB\")\nTo spark positive change, bolster employee resiliency, and strengthen our community, DIB is embedded across company programs. Our approach comprises investing in the next generation of talent, cultivating a culture of inclusion, and belonging and advancing and retaining our employees.\nTo invest in the talent of the future, we provide financial contributions, employee engagement, and support of science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics education and partnerships at K-12 schools and universities.\nWe have programs and practices in place to support creating an environment where individual experiences and perspectives are welcome and where everyone can belong and thrive. This includes equipping our leaders, colleagues, and peers with tools to have open and authentic conversations. We look at diversity, inclusion and belonging comprehensively through hiring, retention, progression, and employee experiences.\nWe empower everyone at Dolby to be co-creators of change by offering employees opportunities to learn and grow through educational sessions, hands-on workshops, and employee-led Employee Network (\"EN\") events. Our EN community encompasses 14 networks, convening around many different dimensions of diversity including gender, race/ethnicity and more, to build community and drive awareness of issues impacting employees identifying with these dimensions of diversity and their allies.\nWe hold ourselves accountable for our progress and publish our global gender diversity and U.S. race and ethnic diversity workforce data annually. We encourage you to review our Sustainability Report for more detailed information.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus, and equity) and benefits packages in each of our locations around the globe. In addition to comprehensive health benefits and the ESPP, depending on the location, employees may also enjoy free or subsidized fitness programs, commuter benefits, wellness credits, tuition reimbursement opportunities, and personal development courses, among other benefits.\nSocial Impact\nThrough our social impact programs, employees from our offices around the world organize to volunteer as individuals, as part of a work team or through our diversity, inclusion, and belonging employee networks. From mentoring youth, to supporting adults re-entering the workforce, to aiding people experiencing hardships, our employees are making our communities stronger. We partner with organizations in our local communities around the world, including the Arts, Media and Entertainment Institute, Bay Area Video Coalition, Girls Make Beats, Girls Who Code, IGNITE Worldwide, Inneract Project, University of Sydneys Women in Engineering Program, and Fundacja Rodziny Maciejko in Poland to organize employee volunteer opportunities. Our efforts are intended to share Dolbys experiences, ideas and approaches from our unique position at the intersection of science, technology and art.\nManagement Succession Planning\nOur Board of Directors works with the Nominating and Governance Committee on succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer, including a process for identifying potential successors. Our Board of Directors has adopted an emergency succession plan in the event of the death, disability, incapacity or unanticipated departure or leave of our Chief Executive Officer. The organization regularly conducts talent reviews for other management roles and key positions for succession management and talent planning purposes.\nBoard Oversight of Human Capital Management\nThrough our Compensation Committee, our Board of Directors provides oversight of human capital matters. Our Nominating and Governance Committee works with the Board of Directors on management succession as described above. The Board and Board committees are supported in these efforts by our management team, People, Legal and Compliance.\nCORPORATE AND AVAILABLE INFORMATION\nWe were founded in London, England in 1965 and incorporated in the State of New York in 1967. We reincorporated in California in 1976 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 2004. Our principal corporate offices are located at 1275 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94103. Our telephone number is (415) 558-0200.\nOur website is www.dolby.com. We make available on our website, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. Our SEC reports can be accessed through the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.dolby.com. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website that contains our SEC filings at www.sec.gov. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem less significant may also affect our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our stock price, business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nREVENUE GENERATION\nMarkets We Target\nOur licensing business depends on the incorporation of our technologies into products and the sales of such products, which are, in large part, not within our control. Our licensing businesses depend on OEMs and other licensees to incorporate our technologies into their products. Our license agreements generally do not have minimum purchase commitments, are typically non-exclusive, and frequently do not mandate incorporation or use of our technologies. Our revenue will decline if our licensees choose not to incorporate our technologies into their products or if they sell fewer products incorporating our technologies.\nChanging trends in content distribution and consumption may negatively impact our business. Changing trends in the way that content is distributed and consumed may impact our existing business and future opportunities for growth. One such trend is the shift by consumers in certain markets away from subscription-based cable and satellite television providers toward streaming services, commonly referred to as \"cord-cutting.\" While cable and satellite television often require a STB, today consumers can also access streaming media through smart TVs or DMA devices. As consumers trend toward canceling subscriptions to these traditional cable and satellite providers and turn to streaming media, we expect demand for STBs in certain regions to continue to decline. If we are unable to derive additional revenue from the smart TV and DMA markets to make up for decreases in our STB-related revenue, our financial results may be negatively impacted. Other changes to the way content is distributed and consumed may impact our licensing and other businesses in a similar fashion, and we may not be able to anticipate and respond effectively to such future changes.\nThe mobile device market is concentrated and susceptible to competition and rapid change, which may negatively affect our penetration and pricing in that market. Successful penetration of the mobile device market is important to our future growth. The mobile device market, particularly smartphones and tablets, is characterized by rapidly changing market conditions, frequent product introductions and intense competition based on features and price. Our technologies usually are not mandated as an industry standard for mobile devices. We must continually convince mobile device OEMs and end users of mobile devices of the value of our technologies. With shorter product lifecycles, it is easier for mobile device OEMs to add or remove our technologies from mobile devices than it is for TV OEMs and other hardware OEMs. In addition, because the mobile industry is concentrated, we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in the mobile market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in mobile devices incorporating our technologies.\nIn order to increase the value of our technologies in the mobile market and increase OEM and software vendor demand for our decoding technologies, we have worked with online and mobile media content service providers to encode their content with our technologies. However, the online and mobile media content services markets are also characterized by intense competition, evolving industry standards and business and distribution models, disruptive software and hardware technology developments, frequent product and service introductions and short life cycles, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers, all of which may result in downward pressure on pricing or the removal of our technologies by these providers and may result in decreased revenue from our mobile market. Further, macroeconomic conditions due to inflation, geopolitical instability, global health risks, and other factors may adversely impact consumer demand for mobile devices. Such conditions may continue to adversely impact the ability of our partners to manufacture such devices, supply chain and distribution, the timing of the adoption of our technologies into products by partners and licensees, and the timing of launches for new products.\nOur revenue from the PC market is reliant on key partnerships and is vulnerable to macroeconomic risks. Our revenue from the PC market depends on several factors, including underlying PC unit shipments, the extent to which our technologies are included on computers, including through operating systems and various subsystems, and the terms of any royalties or other payments we receive. Further, we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in the PC market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in PCs incorporating our technologies. Further, demand for PCs has recently been declining and it remains uncertain\nwhen, if, and to what extent PC demand will return to historic levels. Such conditions may also continue to adversely impact PC manufacturing, supply chain and distribution, the timing of the adoption of our technologies into products by partners and licensees, and the timing of launches for new products.\nThe success of Dolby Cinema and cinema product sales are subject to a number of factors beyond our control, such as the production of films in Dolby formats and broader cinema industry conditions. Revenue from Dolby Cinema and cinema product sales is subject to our ability to develop and implement new technologies, the pace of construction or upgrade of screens, the financial stability of exhibitors, the advent of new or competing technologies, and the willingness of movie studios to produce films in our Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision formats. Although we have invested a substantial amount of time and resources developing Dolby Cinema, and expect to continue to invest and build partnerships in connection with the launch of Dolby Cinema locations, we may not continue to recognize a meaningful amount of revenue from these efforts in the near future. Additionally, we collaborate with multiple exhibitors in foreign markets, including Asia, Europe, and the Middle East, and we may face a number of risks in expanding Dolby Cinema in these and other new international markets. The revenue we receive from Dolby Cinema exhibitors is based on a portion of box-office receipts from the installed theaters, and the timing of such theater installations is dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control. In addition, the success of our Dolby Cinema offering will be tied to the pipeline and success of motion pictures available at Dolby Cinema locations generally. The success of Dolby Cinema and cinema products depends in large part on our ability to differentiate our offering, deploy new sites and installations in accordance with plans, provide a compelling experience, and attract and retain a viewing audience. A decrease in our ability to develop and introduce new cinema products and services successfully could affect licensing of our consumer technologies, because the strength of our brand and our ability to use professional product developments to introduce new consumer technologies would be negatively impacted. To the extent that we do not make progress in these areas or are faced with pricing pressures or competing technologies, our revenue may be adversely impacted.\nOur revenue and associated demand for Dolby Cinema and cinema products are affected by cinema industry and macroeconomic conditions, which are subject to risks including consumer trends and box office performance generally, delays in cinematic releases, the seasonality of film releases and associated moviegoing attendance, and other events or conditions in the cinema industry. Cinema attendance and revenues have been reduced in the wake of COVID-19 and it remains uncertain when, if, and to what extent cinema attendance will return to pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may lead to decreased box office receipts in the near term, which would directly impact the revenue generated by Dolby Cinema theaters and could potentially impact exhibitors willingness and ability to invest in Dolby cinema products. Also, a portion of our opportunity lies in the China market, which is subject to unique economic and geopolitical risks. Furthermore, future growth of our cinema products offerings also depends upon new theater construction and entering into an equipment replacement cycle whereby previously purchased cinema products are upgraded or replaced. To the extent that such cinema industry and macroeconomic challenges constrain the growth of our Dolby Cinema and cinema products offerings, our revenue may be adversely impacted.\nCustomers and Distributors\nThe loss of a key licensee or customer may materially impact our revenue. A small number of our licensees or other customers may represent a significant percentage of our licensing, products, or services revenue. Although we generally have agreements with these licensees and other customers, these agreements typically do not require any minimum purchases or minimum royalty fees and do not prohibit licensees from using competing technologies or customers from purchasing products and services from competitors. Customer demand for our technologies and products can shift quickly as many of our markets are rapidly evolving. In consumer electronic device markets, our technologies are not mandated and are subject to significant competition, so there is a risk that a large consumer electronic device licensee may reduce or eliminate its use of our technologies.\nOur licensing business depends, in part, on semiconductor manufacturers and the availability of semiconductor components. Our licensing revenue from OEM system licensees depends in large part upon the availability of ICs that implement our technologies. IC manufacturers incorporate our technologies into these ICs, which are then incorporated in consumer entertainment products. We do not manufacture these ICs, but rather depend on IC manufacturers to develop, produce, and then sell them to system licensees in accordance with their agreements. We do not control the IC manufacturers decisions on whether or not to incorporate our technologies into their ICs, and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts. Further, demand levels may result in shortages\nof semiconductor components and other key materials that may adversely impact the ability of our implementation and system licensees and other customers to meet product demand in a timely fashion.\nConsumer spending weakness may impact our licensees and licensing revenues generally. Weakness in general economic conditions due to inflation, heightened interest rates, lower consumer confidence, a potential recession, pandemic or other worsening economic conditions, may suppress consumer demand in our markets and consumers going to the movies. Many of the products in which our technologies are incorporated are discretionary goods, such as PCs, TVs, STBs, Blu-ray Disc players, video game consoles, AVRs, mobile devices, in-car entertainment systems, and home-theater systems, which makes revenue generated by such technologies vulnerable to weakness in consumer spending. Weakness in consumer spending may also lead to licensees and other customers becoming delinquent on their obligations to us or being unable to pay, resulting in a higher level of write-offs. Weakness in consumer spending may also increase underreporting and non-reporting of royalty-bearing revenue by our licensees as well as increase the unauthorized use of our technologies.\nOur reliance on distributors may impact sales of certain products and present compliance risks. We rely significantly on a global network of independent, regional distributors to market and distribute our cinema and broadcast products. Our distributor arrangements are non-exclusive and our distributors are not obligated to buy our products and can represent competing products. Thus, they may be unwilling or unable to dedicate the resources necessary to promote our portfolio of products. Our distributors could retain product channel inventory levels that exceed future anticipated sales, which could affect our future sales to those distributors. In addition, failure of our distributors to adhere to our policies designed to promote compliance with global anticorruption laws, export controls, and local laws, could subject us to criminal or civil penalties and stockholder litigation.\nMarketing and Branding\nIf we fail to promote and maintain the Dolby brand, our business will suffer. Maintaining and strengthening the Dolby brand is critical to maintaining and expanding our licensing, products, and services business, as well as our ability to offer technologies for new markets, including Dolby Cinema, Dolby Vision and other imaging offerings for the consumer market, Dolby.io, and others. Our continued success depends on our reputation for providing high quality technologies, products, and services across a wide range of entertainment markets, including the consumer electronics, PC, broadcast, and gaming markets. If we fail to promote and maintain the Dolby brand successfully in licensing, products or services, our business will suffer. Furthermore, we believe that the strength of our brand may affect the likelihood that our technologies are adopted as industry standards in various markets and for various applications. Our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand will depend heavily on our ability to develop innovative technologies for the entertainment industry, to enter into new markets successfully, and to provide high quality products and services in these new markets. In addition, our practices and public disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters could impact our brand and reputation. If our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and societal and regulatory standards, or if we are unable to make progress on or achieve our goals and objectives in this area, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIndustry Standards\nCertain parts of our business are dependent on the inclusion of our technologies in industry standards, the adoption and development of which are not fully within our control. Standards-setting organizations establish technology standards for use in a wide range of products and solutions. The entertainment industry in particular has historically depended upon industry standards to ensure compatibility and interoperability across delivery platforms and a wide variety of consumer entertainment products. We make significant efforts to design our products and technologies to address capability, quality, and cost considerations so that they either meet or, more importantly, are adopted as industry standards across the broad range of entertainment industry markets in which we participate, as well as the markets in which we plan to compete in the future. We are also active in standards development where many contributing members work together to come up with next-generation technology standards in media, entertainment, and communications technologies. Nonetheless, it can be difficult to have our technologies and products adopted as industry standards. To do so, we must convince a broad spectrum of standards-setting organizations throughout the world, as well as our major customers and licensees who are members of such organizations, to adopt them as such. Multiple companies, including ones that typically compete against one another, are involved in the development of new technology standards for use in consumer products. Furthermore, some standards-setting organizations choose to adopt a set of optional standards or a combination of mandatory and optional standards; in such cases, our technologies may be adopted only as an optional standard and not a mandatory standard. Standards may also change in ways that are unfavorable to Dolby.\nThe market for broadcast technologies in particular has traditionally been heavily based on industry standards, in some cases mandated by governments choosing from among alternative standards, and we expect this to continue to be the case in the future. The continued advancement of OTT media delivery and consumption is altering the landscape for broadcast standards and impacting the importance of the inclusion of our technology in certain broadcast standards, and we cannot predict if and to what extent this may impact our revenue.\nParticipants may choose alternative technologies within standards. Even when a standards-setting organization incorporates our technologies in an industry standard for a particular market or geographic region, our technologies may not be the sole technologies adopted for that market. Furthermore, different standards may be adopted within a single market or region, and across different markets and regions. Our operating results depend upon participants in that market choosing to adopt our technologies instead of competitive technologies that also may be acceptable under such standard. For example, the continued growth of our revenue from the broadcast market will depend upon both the continued global adoption of DTV generally, including in emerging markets, and the choice to use our technologies where it is one of several accepted industry standards.\nBeing part of a standard may limit our licensing practices. When a standards-setting organization mandates our technologies, we generally must agree to license such technologies on a fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory basis, which could limit our control over the use of these technologies. In these situations, we must often limit the royalty rates we charge for these technologies, and we may be unable to limit to whom we license such technologies or to restrict many terms of the license. We have in the past, and may in the future, be subject to claims that our licensing of industry standard technologies may not conform to the requirements of the standards-setting organization. Allegations such as these could be asserted in private actions seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. Claimants in such cases could seek to restrict or change our licensing practices or our ability to license our technologies. Additionally, where our technologies are incorporated into a standard, our licensing practices may become subject to additional regulatory requirements. For example, the European Union (EU) legislature is considering regulation that would impose a number of requirements on standard essential patent (SEP) licensing practices in the EU. Such regulation could, if it comes into effect, impose additional costs and disclosure requirements on our SEP licensing business and potentially reduce associated revenue.\nRoyalty Reporting\nReporting practices and uncertainty may result in fluctuations in our royalty revenue from period to period. Our operating results fluctuate based on the risks set forth in this section, as well as, among other factors, on:\nRoyalty reports including positive or negative corrective adjustments;\nRetroactive royalties that cover extended periods of time; and\nTiming of revenue recognition under licensing agreements and other contractual arrangements, including recognition of unusually large amounts of revenue in any given quarter.\nOur results of operations could be impacted to the extent that actual revenue differs significantly from estimated revenue, or that we are required to accelerate recognition of revenue under certain arrangements, potentially causing the amount of revenue we recognize to vary materially from quarter to quarter. While our reporting practices do not change the cash flows or total revenue we receive from our contracts with customers, it could result in changes to the timing of our reported revenue and income, which in turn could cause volatility in the price of our Class A common stock.\nRoyalty reporting by our licensees may be inaccurate or understated. We generate licensing revenue primarily from OEMs who license our technologies and incorporate those technologies into their products. Our license agreements generally obligate our licensees to pay us a specified royalty for every product they ship that incorporates our technologies, and we rely on our licensees to report their shipments accurately. However, it is inherently difficult to independently determine whether our licensees are reporting shipments accurately, particularly with respect to software incorporating our technologies because unauthorized copies of such software can be made relatively easily. A third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or, as a result of an audit, a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation. We are regularly involved in discussions with third party technology licensees regarding license terms. Most of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees records, and we routinely exercise these rights, typically by using an independent third party auditor. Such audits are generally expensive, time-consuming, and potentially detrimental to our ongoing business relationships with our licensees. In the past, licensees have understated or failed to report the number of products incorporating our technologies that they shipped, and we have not been able to collect and recognize revenue to which we were\nentitled. We expect that we will continue to experience understatement and non-reporting of royalties by our licensees. We have been able to obtain certain recovery payments from licensees (either in the form of back payments or settlements), and such recoveries have become a recurring element of our business; however, we are unable to predict with certainty the revenue that we may recover in the future or our ability to continue to obtain such recoveries at all.\nEstimation of sales-based royalties may differ from actual results, which may cause volatility in royalty revenue from period to period. We recognize a material portion of our licensing revenue based on our estimate of shipments to which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements. Upon receipt of actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we estimated previously, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. This may cause volatility in our quarterly figures because of the estimation process and the corresponding true-up adjustments, which we disclose.\nThe amount of royalties we owe others may be disputed. In some cases, the products we sell and the technologies we license include IP that we have licensed from third parties. Our agreements with these third parties generally require us to pay them royalties for that use, and to give the third parties the right to audit our calculation of those royalties. A third party may disagree with our interpretation of the terms of a license agreement or, as a result of an audit, a third party could challenge the accuracy of our calculation. A successful challenge by a third party could result in the termination of a license agreement or an increase in the amount of royalties we have to pay to the third party.\nTECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nDeveloping new and enhanced technologies is inherently difficult and our revenue growth may be impacted if we are unsuccessful in our efforts. Our revenue growth will depend upon our success in new and existing markets for our technologies, such as digital broadcast, mobile devices, online and mobile media distribution, cinema, consumer imaging and communications. The markets for our technologies and products are influenced by:\nRapid technological change;\nNew and improved technology and frequent product introductions;\nChanging consumer and licensee demands;\nEvolving industry standards; and\nTechnology and product obsolescence.\nOur future success depends on our ability to enhance our technologies and products and to develop new technologies and products that address market needs in a timely manner, including the development of technologies and products that incorporate rapidly developing machine learning and other artificial intelligence technologies (AI/ML). Technology development is a complex, uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development personnel, and the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to identify, develop, acquire, market, or support new or enhanced technologies or products on a timely basis, if at all. If we are unable to develop technologies and related intellectual property that are accepted into technology standards, or are unable to do so at the same rate as other technology developers, our royalty share within patent pools that we participate in may decline.\nOur efforts to expand into new markets may not be successful. Our future growth will depend, in part, upon our continued expansion into areas beyond our audio licensing business. As we enter into new markets, we will face new sources of competition, new business models, and new customer relationships. In order to be successful in these markets, we will need to cultivate new industry relationships and strengthen existing relationships to bring our products, services, and technologies to market. Our limited experience in new markets could limit our ability to successfully execute on our growth strategy.\nThe success of our existing products and newer initiatives is dependent on the use of Dolby formats in, and commercial success of, products and content. The success of many of our newer initiatives, such as Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and Dolby Cinema, is dependent upon the availability and success of (i) products that incorporate Dolby formats and (ii) content produced in Dolby formats. However, there is no guarantee that device makers will continue to incorporate Dolby formats into their products, that content creators will continue to release content in Dolby formats, or that either those products or that content will be commercially successful.\nFor instance, to broaden adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, we will need to continue to expand the\narray of products and consumer devices that incorporate Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, expand the pipeline of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision content available from content creators, and encourage consumer adoption in the face of competing products and technologies. Similarly, the success of Dolby Cinema is dependent on our ability to partner with movie theater exhibitors to launch new Dolby Cinema sites and to deploy new sites in accordance with plans, and on the continued release and box-office success of new films in the Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos formats released through Dolby Cinemas.\nFurther, the commercial success of products incorporating Dolby formats, content released in Dolby formats, and Dolby Cinemas generally, depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to, consumer preferences, critical reception, timing of release, marketing efforts of third-parties, and general market conditions. Moreover, release and distribution of such products and content can be subject to delays in production or changes in release schedule, which can negatively impact the quantity, timing and quality of such products and content released in Dolby formats and available at Dolby Cinema theaters.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur business is dependent on protecting our intellectual property rights. Our business is dependent upon protecting our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other IP rights, the loss or expiration of which may significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition. Effective IP rights protection, however, may not be available under the laws of every country in which our products and services and those of our licensees are distributed. The efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. We also seek to maintain select IP as trade secrets, and third parties or our employees could intentionally or accidentally compromise the IP that we maintain as trade secrets. In addition, protecting our IP rights is costly and time consuming. We have taken steps in the past to enforce our IP rights and expect to do so in the future. However, it may not be practicable or cost effective for us to enforce our IP rights fully, particularly in some countries or where the initiation of a claim might harm our business relationships.\nWe generally seek patent protection for our innovations. However, our patent program faces a number of challenges, including:\nPossibility that innovations may not be protectable;\nFailure to protect innovations that later turn out to be important;\nInsufficient patent protection to prevent third parties from designing around our patent claims;\nOur pending patent applications may not be approved; and\nPossibility that an issued patent may later be found to be invalid or unenforceable.\nOur revenue could decline if we are unable to maintain patent coverage for our technologies. Many of the technologies that we license to our system licensees are covered by patents, and the licensing revenue that we receive from those licenses depends in large part upon the life of such patents. In general, our agreements with our licensees require them to pay us a full royalty with respect to a particular technology only until there are no patents or, in some cases, no patent applications covering that technology in countries where applicable products are made and sold. As of September 29, 2023, we had approximately 19,300 issued patents in addition to approximately 1,900 pending patent applications in more than 100 jurisdictions throughout the world. Our currently issued patents expire at various times through September 2045. If we are unable to refresh our technology with new patented inventions or expand our patent portfolio, our revenue could decline. In addition to patents covering technology we license directly, if patents we license through patent pool arrangements expire or are otherwise deemed not to be valuable by the licensees of such patent pools, they may not renew their licenses, which could impact our revenue.\nWe seek to mitigate this risk in a variety of ways. We regularly look for opportunities to expand our patent portfolio through organic development and acquisitions. We develop technologies to replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents with licensing revenue supported by patents with a longer remaining life. And we develop and license our intellectual property in a manner designed to promote the continued use and licensing of our technology. The continued success of these risk mitigation strategies is not guaranteed, including the risk that such technologies will not achieve widespread adoption or be licensed at a rate sufficient to replace licensing revenue from technologies covered by expiring patents.\nIn the case of our patent coverage related to DD, some of our relevant patents have expired, but others continue to apply. DD is our solution that includes technology necessary to implement AC-3 as it has been updated over time. We have continued to innovate and develop IP to support the standard and its implementation. Our customers use our\nDD implementation for quality, reliability, and performance, even in locations where we have not had applicable patent coverage. While in the past, we derived a significant portion of our licensing revenue from our DD technologies, this is no longer the case as revenue attributed to DD technologies has declined and is expected to continue to decline.\nMany of our partners have adopted newer generations of our offerings such as DD+, and the range of products incorporating DD solutions is now limited to DVD players (but not Blu-ray players) and some TVs, STBs and soundbars. To continue to be successful in our audio licensing business, we must keep transitioning our DD licensees to our newer technologies, including our DD+ and Dolby AC-4 technologies.\nUnauthorized use of our intellectual property has occurred and will likely continue to occur. We have often experienced, and expect to continue to experience, problems with non-licensee OEMs and software vendors, particularly in China and certain emerging economies, incorporating our technologies and trademarks into their products without our authorization and without paying us any licensing fees. Manufacturers of ICs containing our technologies occasionally sell these ICs to third parties who are not our system licensees. These sales, and the failure of such manufacturers to report the sales, facilitate the unauthorized use of our IP. As emerging economies transition from analog to digital content, such as the transition from analog to digital broadcast, we expect to experience an increase in problems with this form of piracy.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by intellectual property litigation. Companies in the technology and entertainment industries frequently engage in litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of IP rights. We have faced such claims in the past, and we expect to face similar claims in the future. Any IP claims, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, expensive to litigate or settle, and could divert management resources and attention. In the past, we have settled claims relating to infringement allegations and agreed to make payments in connection with such settlements. An adverse determination in any IP claim could require that we pay damages or stop using technologies found to be in violation of a third partys rights and could prevent us from offering our products and services to others. In order to avoid these restrictions, we may have to seek a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Licensors could also require us to pay significant royalties. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technologies, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technologies for any aspects of our business found to be infringing, we may be forced to limit our product and service offerings and may be unable to compete effectively.\nIn some instances, we have contractually agreed to provide indemnifications to licensees relating to our IP. Additionally, at times we have chosen to defend our licensees from third party IP infringement claims even where such defense was not contractually required, and we may choose to take on such defense in the future.\nOur business may be negatively impacted by disputes involving the licensing of our IP. At times, we are engaged in disputes regarding the licensing of our IP rights, including matters related to our royalty rates, whether products are royalty-bearing, and other terms of our licensing arrangements. These types of disputes can be asserted by our customers or prospective customers or by other third parties as part of negotiations with us or in private actions seeking monetary damages or injunctive relief, or in regulatory actions. In the past, licensees have threatened to initiate litigation against us based on potential antitrust claims or regarding our licensing royalty rate practices. Damages and requests for injunctive relief asserted in claims like these could be significant, and could be disruptive to our business.\nMaintaining and enforcing our IP rights in the U.S. and abroad presents challenges to our business. Our licensing business depends in part on the uniform and consistent treatment of patent rights in the U.S. and abroad. Changes to the patent and intellectual property laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the regulation regarding SEP licensing in the EU referenced above, may limit our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our rights. Additionally, court and administrative rulings may interpret existing patent laws and regulations in ways that hurt our ability to obtain, license, and enforce our patents. We face challenges protecting our IP in foreign jurisdictions, including:\nOur ability to enforce our contractual and IP rights, especially in countries that do not recognize and enforce IP rights to the same extent as the U.S., Japan, Korea, and European countries do, which increases the risk of unauthorized use of our technologies; and\nBecause of limitations in the legal systems in many countries, our ability to obtain and enforce patents in many countries is uncertain, and we must strengthen and develop relationships with entertainment industry participants worldwide to increase our ability to enforce our IP and contractual rights without relying solely on the legal systems in the countries in which we operate.\nOPERATIONS\nReliance on key suppliers presents certain risks to our business, many of which are beyond our control. Our reliance on suppliers for some of the key materials and components we use in manufacturing our products involves risks, including limited control over the price, timely delivery, and quality of such components, as well as delays caused by military conflicts, including those between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, and other potential interruptions to the supply chain. Due to the relatively small volume of components we purchase for use in manufacturing, we purchase such components primarily through distributors. As such, we have relatively limited influence over the suppliers of such components to, for example, ensure continuity of supply. Although we have identified alternate suppliers for most of our key materials and components, any required changes in our suppliers could cause delays in our operations and increase our production costs. In addition, our suppliers may not be able to meet our production demands as to volume, quality, or timeliness.\nMoreover, we rely on sole source suppliers for some of the components that we use to manufacture our products, including specific charged coupled devices, light emitting diodes, and digital signal processors. These sole source suppliers may become unable or unwilling to deliver these components to us at an acceptable cost or at all, which could force us to redesign those specific products. Our inability to obtain timely delivery of key components of acceptable quality, any significant increases in the prices of components, or the redesign of our products could result in production delays, increased costs, and reductions in shipments of our products.\nEnsuring the quality of our products and the products in which our technology is incorporated is inherently difficult, and product quality failures can be costly. Our products, and products that incorporate our technologies, are complex and sometimes contain software or hardware errors that are not detected during testing, particularly when first introduced or when new versions are released. In addition, we have limited control over manufacturing performed by contract manufacturers, which could result in quality problems. Furthermore, our products and technologies are sometimes combined with or incorporated into products from other vendors, sometimes making it difficult to identify the source of a problem or, in certain instances, making the quality of our implementation dependent in part upon the quality of such other vendors' products. Any negative publicity or impact relating to these product problems could affect the perception of our brand and market acceptance of our products or technologies. These errors could result in a loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products or cause delays in delivering them and meeting customer demands, any of which could reduce our revenue and raise significant customer relations issues. In addition, if our products or technologies contain errors, we could be required to replace or reengineer them or rely upon parties who have incorporated our technologies into their products to implement updates to address such issues, which could cause delays or increase our costs. Moreover, if any such errors cause unintended consequences, we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims. Although we generally attempt to contractually limit our liability, if these contract provisions are not enforced, or are unenforceable for any reason, or if liabilities arise that are not effectively limited, we could incur substantial costs in defending and settling product liability claims.\nProduction processes for our products are subject to interruption, delay, and other risks. Production difficulties or inefficiencies can interrupt production, resulting in our inability to deliver products on time or in a cost effective manner, which could harm our competitive position. While we have one production facility, we increasingly use contract manufacturers for a significant portion of our production capacity. Our reliance on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products involves risks, including limited control over timely delivery and quality of such products. If production of our products is interrupted, we may not be able to manufacture products on a timely basis. A shortage of manufacturing capacity for our products could negatively impact our operating results and damage our customer relationships. We may be unable to quickly adapt our manufacturing capacity to rapidly changing market conditions and a contract manufacturer may encounter similar difficulties. Likewise, we may be unable to quickly respond to fluctuations in customer demand or contract manufacturer interruptions. At times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for some of our products. Supply chain disruptions and extended lead times for semiconductor and electrical components may limit the availability of products and result in difficulty meeting demand.\nWe face threats to our information security systems, cyber attacks, and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in the misappropriation of sensitive information, disruption of our business, reputational damage, legal exposure, and financial losses. We rely on information technology systems in the conduct of our business, including systems designed and managed by third parties. Many of these systems contain sensitive and confidential information, including our trade secrets and proprietary business information, and personal data, as well as content and information owned by or pertaining to our customers, suppliers and business partners. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Increasingly, companies are subject to a wide\nvariety of attacks on their networks and systems on an ongoing basis. Our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by malicious actors including, but not limited to, nation-states and cyber criminals, malware, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, ransomware attacks, or other disruptions. This sensitive, confidential or proprietary information may be misappropriated by third-party service providers or others who may inappropriately access or exfiltrate that information from a third-party service provider's system.\nThe number and sophistication of malicious cyber attacks and disruptions that companies have experienced has increased over the past few years, including computer viruses, malware, ransomware, cyber extortion, social engineering, denial of service, supply chain attacks, and other similar attacks and disruptions. These risks could be elevated in connection with military conflicts around the world. Measures we have undertaken to protect our information technology systems may be unsuccessful in deterring or repelling malicious actors. Since techniques used by malicious actors (many of whom are highly sophisticated and well-funded) to access or sabotage networks and computer systems change frequently and often are not recognized until after they are used, we may be unable to anticipate or immediately detect these techniques. This could delay our detection and response, or impede the effectiveness of our response, our operations and ability to limit our exposure to third-party claims and other potential liability. Attacks on our systems have occurred in the past and may occur, and be successful, in the future. Such risks are also faced by our third-party service providers and others, which forms another vector for malicious attacks on our systems.\nWe also may suffer data security breaches and the unauthorized access to, misuse or acquisition of, personal data or other sensitive and confidential information as the result of intentional or inadvertent breaches or other compromises, including by our employees or service providers. Any data security breach or other incident, whether external or internal in origin, could compromise our networks and systems, create system disruptions or slowdowns and exploit security vulnerabilities of our products. Any such breach or other incident can result in the information stored on our networks and systems, or our vendors' networks and systems, being improperly accessed or acquired, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen, which could subject us to liability to our customers, suppliers, business partners and others, as well as regulatory investigations, fines or penalties, and such incidents and the public disclosure of such incidents may cause brand and reputational damage. We make efforts to detect and investigate such attempts and incidents and to prevent their recurrence where practicable through changes to our internal processes and tools, but in some cases preventive and remedial action might not be successful. Disruptions to our information technology systems, due to outages, security breaches or other causes, could also have severe consequences to our business, including financial loss and reputational damage.\nWe must comply with a variety of data privacy regulations. Compliance with such regulations can be costly and failure to comply may affect our operations, financial performance, and business. A variety of provincial, state, national, and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These laws and regulations are evolving, including with respect to the development and use of AI/ML technologies, and may result in ever-increasing obligations and regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions. For example, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which took effect on January 1, 2023 (with certain provisions of the CPRA having retroactive effect to January 1, 2022), as well as obligations from new privacy laws in Virginia, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Iowa, Indiana, Texas, Montana, Oregon, Delaware, Florida, and Tennessee that have taken or will take effect between 2023 and 2026, may require us to further modify certain of our information practices and could subject us to additional compliance costs and expenses. Our actual or perceived failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection (including regimes such as the CPRA and continuing developments in the European Union, U.K., and U.S. data privacy frameworks that are rapidly evolving) could result in regulatory fines, investigations and enforcement actions, penalties and other liabilities, claims for damages by affected individuals, and damage to our reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Our commercial and cybersecurity insurance policies may be insufficient to insure us against these risks, and future escalations in premiums and deductibles under these policies may render them uneconomical.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets for our technologies are highly competitive. The markets for our technologies are highly competitive, and we face competitive threats and pricing pressure in our markets. Consumers may perceive the quality of the visual and audio experiences produced by some of our competitors technologies to be equivalent or superior to the sight and sound experiences produced by our technologies. Some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, and other resources than we do, or may have more experience or advantages in the markets in which they compete. These competitors may also be able to offer\nintegrated systems in markets for entertainment technologies on a royalty-free basis or at a lower price than our technologies, including audio, imaging, and other technologies, which could make competing technologies that we develop less attractive. These competitors may also be able to develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products less competitive. For example, disruptive technologies such as AI/ML may significantly alter the market for our products in unpredictable ways and reduce customer demand.\nMany of the markets for our products and for products in which our technologies are incorporated are price sensitive. The markets for the consumer entertainment products in which our technologies are incorporated are intensely competitive and price sensitive. We expect to face increased royalty pricing pressure for our technologies as we seek to drive the adoption of our technologies into online content and portable devices, such as tablets and smartphones. Such pricing pressures may be exacerbated by elevated rates of inflation, which may cause device manufacturers to take additional steps to limit costs. Retail prices for consumer entertainment products that include our audio technologies, such as home theater systems, have decreased significantly, and we expect prices to decrease for the foreseeable future. In response, OEMs have sought to reduce their product costs, which can result in additional downward pressure on the licensing fees we charge. Further, Dolby.io faces pricing pressure from other platforms offering similar solutions that may be able to offer competing services at lower prices.\nWe face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. We face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors. For example, Samsung is a significant customer, but some of its technologies are competitive with some of our consumer, broadcast, and cinema technologies. Our customers may choose to use competing technologies they have developed or in which they have an interest rather than use our technologies. The existence of important customer relationships may influence which strategic opportunities we pursue, as we may forgo some opportunities in the interests of preserving a critical customer relationship.\nWe face competition from other audio formats, imaging solutions, and integrated system offerings. We believe that the success we have had licensing our audio and imaging technologies is due, in part, to the high quality of the solutions that our technologies provide and to the strength of our brand. However, both free and proprietary sound and imaging technologies are becoming increasingly prevalent, and we expect competitors to continue to enter these fields with other offerings. Furthermore, to the extent that customers perceive our competitors products as providing the same or similar advantages as our technologies at a lower or comparable price, there is a risk that these customers may treat sound and video encoding technologies as commodities, resulting in loss of status of our technologies, decline in their use, and significant pricing pressure. For example, we face competition with respect to our HDR imaging technology, Dolby Vision, and there can be no assurance that additional consumers will adopt Dolby Vision in the near future, or at all, or that we will maintain our existing customers.\nIn addition, some of our current or potential competitors may be able to offer integrated systems in certain markets for entertainment technologies, including audio and imaging, which could make competing technologies that we develop or acquire obsolete. By offering an integrated system solution, these potential competitors may also be able to offer competing technologies at lower prices than we can, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nSTRATEGIC ACTIVITIES\nThe success of our business depends on strong industry relationships. To be successful, we must maintain and grow our relationships with a broad range of industry participants, including:\nContent creators, such as film directors, studios, mobile and online content producers, and music producers;\nContent distributors, such as studios, film exhibitors, broadcasters, operators, streaming providers, and OTT video service providers and video game publishers;\nCompanies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement; and\nDevice manufacturers.\nIndustry relationships have historically played an important role in the markets that we serve, particularly in the entertainment market. For example, sales of our products and services are particularly dependent upon our relationships with major film studios and broadcasters, and licensing of our technologies is particularly dependent upon our relationships with system licensees and IC manufacturers. Industry relationships also play an important role in other markets we serve; for instance, our relationships with companies building real-time digital experiences support the adoption of Dolby.io solutions. If we fail to maintain and strengthen our industry relationships, industry\nparticipants may be less likely to purchase and use our technologies, products, and services, or create content incorporating our technologies.\nOur M&A activity is subject to certain risks, including risks associated with integrating acquired businesses. We evaluate a wide array of possible strategic transactions, including acquisitions. We consider these types of transactions in connection with, among other things, our efforts to strengthen our audio and cinema businesses and expand beyond audio technologies. Although we cannot predict whether or not we will complete any such acquisitions or other transactions in the future, any of these transactions could be significant in relation to our market capitalization, financial condition, or results of operations. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology may create unforeseen difficulties and expenditures. Foreign acquisitions involve unique risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages; currency risks; and risks associated with the economic, political, and regulatory environment in specific countries. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, and write-offs of goodwill. Future acquisitions may also require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on favorable terms or at all, particularly during times of market volatility, rising interest rates, and general economic instability. Also, the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions may not materialize.\nWe face various risks in integrating acquired businesses, including:\nDiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\nCultural and logistical challenges associated with integrating employees from acquired businesses into our organization;\nRetaining employees, suppliers and customers from businesses we acquire;\nThe need to implement or improve internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\nPossible write-offs or impairment charges resulting from acquisitions;\nUnanticipated or unknown liabilities relating to acquired businesses; and\nThe need to integrate acquired businesses accounting, management information, manufacturing, human resources, and other administrative systems to permit effective management.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY COMPLIANCE\nConducting business internationally presents a number of risks to our business, including trade restrictions and changing, unpredictable, and/or inconsistent laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue. Approximately 64%, 63% and 67% of our revenue was derived outside of the U.S. in fiscal year 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We are subject to a number of risks related to conducting business internationally, including:\nU.S. and foreign government trade restrictions or sanctions, including those which may impose restrictions on the importation or exportation of products, equipment, materials, software, technologies, services, on technology transfers, or on the receipt or collection of payments and distribution of royalties, and any political or economic responses or counter-responses to such restrictions or sanctions, including any such restrictions, sanctions, responses, or counter-responses related to global military conflicts or changes in US export controls related to China and other countries;\nChanges in trade relationships, including new tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes and other trade barriers imposed by the U.S. or by other countries;\nCompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including antitrust and other competition laws and laws and regulations that relate to environmental, social, and governance matters, that may change unexpectedly, differ, or conflict with laws in other countries where we conduct business, or are otherwise not harmonized with one another;\nForeign government taxes, regulations, and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the U.S., and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the U.S.;\nPotential adverse changes in the political, social, and/or economic stability of or conflicts within the regions in which we operate (including Europe, Russia, Asia, the Middle East, North Africa, Latin America and other emerging markets) or in diplomatic relations between governments;\nDifficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations, including but not limited to restrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation, relationships with local labor unions and works councils, investment restrictions and/or requirements, and restrictions on foreign ownership of subsidiaries;\nAdverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake;\nPoor recognition and enforcement of IP rights;\nDifficulties in enforcing contractual rights;\nMulti-jurisdictional data protection and privacy laws, including, for example, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and restrictions on transferring personal data outside of a jurisdiction and potential legislation such as the Artificial Intelligence Act under consideration in the EU potentially impacting our development of products incorporating AI/ML or the use of AI/ML tools in our business; and\nThe global macroeconomic environment and potential slowing of key markets we serve.\nAny or all of these factors may impact our ability to operate in foreign countries and our ability to develop, the demand for, and profitability of, our technologies and products, as well as our customers' products that incorporate our technologies.\nCertain foreign governments, particularly in China, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure on royalties for IP. The regulatory enforcement activities in such jurisdictions can be unpredictable, in some cases because these jurisdictions have only recently implemented competition laws. From time to time, we are the subject of requests for information, market conduct examinations, inquiries or investigations by industry groups and/or regulatory agencies in these jurisdictions. For instance, the Korean Fair Trade Commission requested information relating to our business practices in South Korea on various occasions, and initially made findings regarding the audit of a single customer. In July 2023, that determination was overturned by the Korean Civil court and thus the matter was fully resolved in Dolbys favor. In the event that we are involved in significant disputes or are the subject of a formal action by a regulatory agency, our results could be negatively impacted and we could be exposed to costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.\nIn many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. regulations applicable to us such as the FCPA and U.S. export controls. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with the FCPA and U.S. export controls, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, distributors, dealers, and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies or these regulations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations may pose additional costs on and otherwise impact our products and operations. Our products and operations may be regulated under federal, state, local, and international laws governing the environment, including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management, disposal, and labeling of hazardous substances and wastes, the achievement of certain energy performance criteria, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations have the potential to affect our operations, increase our costs, decrease our revenue, or change the way we design or manufacture our products. We face increasing complexity in our product design as we adjust to requirements relating to the materials composition of our products. In some products, the use or avoidance of particular components that contain regulated hazardous substances may be more difficult or costly, and additional redesign efforts could result in production delays. We could incur costs, fines, and civil or criminal sanctions, third party property damage or personal injury claims, or could be required to incur substantial investigation or remediation costs, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.\nWe are subject to regulations relating to conflict minerals and compliance with, or failure to comply with, such regulations may be costly. SEC rules require the disclosure of the use of tantalum, tin, tungsten, and gold (commonly referred to as \"conflict minerals\") that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries. Certain of those minerals are used in the manufacturing process of electrical components that our products utilize. The potential inclusion of conflict minerals in the materials used in our products could affect the sourcing,\navailability and pricing of such materials as well as the companies we use to manufacture our products. In circumstances where sources of conflict minerals from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or surrounding countries are not validated as conflict free, we may take actions to change materials, designs or manufacturers to reduce the possibility that our contracts to manufacture products that contain conflict minerals finance or benefit local armed groups in the region. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers that can certify that they are offering conflict free conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that our component suppliers will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. These actions could also add engineering and other costs in connection with the manufacturing of our products. If conflict minerals used in our products are determined to finance armed conflict, even if we are not aware of such status, disclosure of such status could affect public and investor perception of Dolby and our products.\nWe may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used in our components. Our reputation may suffer if we determine that our components contain conflict minerals that are not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our components. In addition, some customers may require that all of our products are certified to be conflict free and if we cannot satisfy these customers, they may choose a competitor's products.\nWe are subject to complex and changing tax laws which may impact our financial results. We are a U.S. multi-national company that is subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. We must use judgment to determine our worldwide tax provision. We earn a significant amount of our income outside the U.S. and receive tax benefits from a portion of these foreign sales. Realizability of these benefits are contingent upon existing current tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and countries where we operate. The following could materially affect our effective tax rate:\nChanges in geographic mix of earnings, where earnings are lower than anticipated in countries with lower tax rates and higher than anticipated in countries with higher tax rates;\nChanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\nChanges in transfer pricing arrangements;\nOutcomes of tax audits;\nChanges in accounting principles;\nChanges in tax laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, including an increase in tax rates, or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense; or\nOur ability to effectively implement changes to our corporate structure in response to changes in applicable tax laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.\nChanges in U.S. tax law, including the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") and the Inflation Reduction Act, may affect our business. These provisions, their interpretations, and proposed changes to law introduced by the current administration could further impact our corporate trading structure and adversely affect our tax rate and cash flow in future years.\nIn addition, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international association of many countries including the U.S., has made changes to many long-standing transfer pricing and cross-border taxation rules that affect our operations. The OECD has introduced a framework to implement a 15% global minimum corporate tax, referred to as Pillar 2 or the minimum tax directive. The minimum tax directive has been adopted by the EU for implementation by its Member States into national legislation by the end of 2023 and may be adopted by other jurisdictions, including the U.S. Further, the OECD, European Commission, EU Member States and other individual countries have made and could make additional competing jurisdictional claims over the taxes owed on earnings of multinational companies in their respective countries or regions. To the extent these actions take place in the countries that we operate, it is possible that these law changes and efforts may increase uncertainty and have an adverse impact on our effective tax rates or operations.\nWe are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and to consider potential responsive actions, but an adverse decision by tax authorities exceeding our reserves could significantly impact our financial results.\nSTOCK-RELATED ISSUES\nThe Dolby family has control over stockholder decisions as a result of the control of a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock by them and their affiliates. At September 29, 2023, the Dolby family and\ntheir affiliates owned 388,372 shares of our Class A common stock and 36,012,733 shares of our Class B common stock. As of September 29, 2023, the Dolby family and their affiliates had voting power of 99.8% of our outstanding Class B common stock, which combined with their shares of our Class A common stock, represented 85.7% of the combined voting power of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock. Under our certificate of incorporation, holders of Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share while holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Generally, shares of Class B common stock automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock upon transfer of such Class B common stock, other than transfers to certain specified persons and entities, including the spouse and descendants of Ray Dolby and the spouses and domestic partners of such descendants.\nAs a result of this dual class structure, the Dolby family and their affiliates will, for the foreseeable future, have significant influence over our management and affairs, and will be able to control virtually all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions such as mergers or other sales of our company or assets, even if they come to own considerably less than 50% of the total number of outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Absent a transfer of Class B common stock that would trigger an automatic conversion as described above, there is no threshold or time deadline at which the shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock.\nMoreover, the Dolby family and their affiliates may take actions in their own interests that our other stockholders do not view as beneficial.\nSales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public markets could reduce the price of our Class A common stock. If our large shareholders, officers, directors or employees sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market, including shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of shares of Class B common stock, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThere are risks associated with our stock repurchase program. Our stock repurchase program may reduce the public float of shares available for trading on a daily basis. Such purchases may be limited, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. There can be no assurance that we will buy additional shares of our Class A common stock under our stock repurchase program or that any future repurchases will have a positive impact on our stock price or EPS. Important factors that could cause us to discontinue or decrease our share repurchases include, among others, unfavorable market conditions, the market price of our Class A common stock, the nature of other investment or strategic opportunities presented to us, the rate of dilution of our equity compensation programs, our ability to make appropriate, timely, and beneficial decisions as to when, how, and whether to purchase shares under the stock repurchase program, the tax consequences of any repurchases (including the potential impact of the 1% excise tax on certain stock repurchases), and the availability of funds necessary to continue purchasing stock. If we curtail our repurchase program, our stock price may be negatively affected.\nThere are risks associated with our dividend program. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to increase dividend payments and/or pay dividends. We are not obligated to pay dividends on our Class A and Class B common stock. In October 2014, we announced a quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders that was initiated by our Board of Directors. Although we anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future, dividend declarations and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the Board of Directors continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be changed or canceled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time. If we do not pay dividends, the market price of our Class A common stock must appreciate for investors to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur and our Class A common stock may in fact depreciate in value.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nMacroeconomic conditions, including elevated inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints, and the lasting effects of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact the markets we serve and our business and results of operations. Our revenue and operations and the markets we serve have been, and may continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to, elevated inflation, rising interest rates, COVID-19-related economic impacts, supply chain constraints, increased shipping costs, international conflicts, reduced discretionary consumer spending, and reduced new product investment by our customers caused by higher interest rates and lower demand. The current macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, many of our licensees and that directly impacts, and may continue to impact, our financial results. The impacts of the current macroeconomic environment on our partners have resulted in, and may continue to cause,\nthe disruption of consumer products' supply chains, shortages of certain semiconductor components, and delays in shipments, product development, and product launches. The macroeconomic conditions also impart substantial uncertainty into our operating environment, which presents additional challenges for our business. These factors and the related uncertainty may cause delays or a decrease in the adoption or implementation of our technologies into new products by partners and licensees. These conditions may impact consumer demand for devices and services and our partners ability to manufacture devices. Further, we may be negatively impacted by delays in transaction cycles and our recoveries efforts due to the noted macroeconomic conditions and related uncertainty. The future implications of these macroeconomic conditions on our business, the markets we serve, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain.\nCOVID-19, including the spread of variants of SARS-CoV-2, continues to impact several of our partners and it is unclear how demand for consumer products that include our technologies may change in response to, and following, the pandemic. The degree to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which cannot be predicted with any certainty, including, but not limited to, the duration and extent of the pandemic, additional actions taken by governments, businesses and consumers in response to the pandemic, additional subsequent outbreaks and variant strains, and to what extent economic and operating conditions can return to pre-pandemic conditions. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, if ever, we may continue to experience an adverse impact to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any persistent economic impacts and any recession that may occur.\nOur results may be impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We earn revenue, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in foreign countries using several currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. The majority of our revenue generated from international markets is denominated in U.S. dollars, while the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currencies. Therefore, our operating expenses will increase when the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency and decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Further, our hedging programs may not be effective to offset any, or more than a portion, of the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements. Additional risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates are described in the Foreign Currency Exchange Risk section of Part II, Item 7A \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nBusiness interruptions by natural disasters and other events beyond our control could adversely impact our business. Although we maintain crisis management plans, our business operations are subject to interruption by natural disasters and catastrophic events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, tropical storms, floods, tsunamis, fires, droughts, tornadoes, public health issues and pandemics, severe changes in climate, war, terrorism, and geopolitical unrest and uncertainties. Further, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, or the fear of such events, could provoke (and in the case of COVID-19 has provoked) responses, including government-imposed travel restrictions and limits on access to entertainment venues. These responses could negatively affect consumer demand and our business, particularly in international markets. War, including the military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas, as well as any related political or economic responses and counter-responses or otherwise by various global actors or the general effect on the global economy and supply chain, could also affect our business. For example, we have R&D facilities and a large number of employees in Eastern Europe, and any business interruptions or other spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine conflict could adversely impact our business.\nAdditionally, several of our offices, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, are located in seismically active regions. Because we do not carry earthquake insurance for earthquake-related losses and significant recovery time could be required to resume operations, our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake or catastrophic event.\nWe face intense competition for employees. In order to be successful, we must attract, develop, and retain employees, including employees to work on our growth initiatives where our current employees may lack experience with the business models and markets we are pursuing. Competition for experienced employees in our markets can be intense. In order to attract and retain employees, we must provide competitive compensation packages, including cash and equity compensation. Our equity awards include stock options, RSUs and performance-based RSUs. The future value of these awards is uncertain and depends on our stock price performance over time. In order for our\ncompensation packages to be viewed as competitive, prospective employees must perceive our equity awards to be a valuable benefit. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nHeadquarters\nOur principal corporate office and worldwide headquarters, which we own, is at 1275 Market Street, San Francisco, California.\nOther Properties\nWe also own a commercial office building located in Sunnyvale, California, and lease additional R&D, sales, product testing, and administrative facilities from third parties in California, New York, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Colorado, and internationally, including in Asia, Europe, Australia, the Middle East, and South America. We believe that our current facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the near future, and that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate our foreseeable future operations.\nDolby Wootton Bassett, LLC, of which Dagmar Dolby as Trustee of the Dagmar Dolby Trust under the Dolby Family Trust Instrument dated May 7, 1999 (the \"Dagmar Dolby Trust\") is the sole member, and the Dagmar Dolby Trust, own a majority financial interest in real estate entities that own and from whom we may lease certain facilities located in Burbank, California and in Wootton Bassett, England. We own the remaining financial interests in these real estate entities. Specifically, we hold a 49.0% minority ownership interest in Dolby Properties Burbank, LLC, which owns a 22,000 square feet facility in Burbank that we are leasing until 2025. We also hold a 10.0% minority ownership interest in Dolby Properties, LP, which owns a 17,500 square foot facility in Wootton Bassett. We are no longer leasing the Wootton Bassett facility.\n100 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California\nSince 1980, we have leased a corporate office located at 100 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California from the various Dolby family trusts. The lease for this office expires on October 31, 2024, and provides approximately 70,000 square feet of space. The Dolby family trusts retain the right, which they have exercised, to sublease approximately 1,617 square feet of office space in the premises at a rental rate equal to the then current base rent per square foot paid by us plus $14 per square foot per year (reflecting estimated costs payable by us for the operation and maintenance of the premises, subject to an annual increase of 1.5% per year during each year of the sublease term).\nWe ceased occupancy of the leased space at 100 Potrero Avenue, and do not intend to re-occupy this location. We remain responsible for operating expenses, taxes, and the condition, operation, repair, maintenance, security, and management of the premises. We have also agreed to indemnify and hold the Dolby family trusts, as landlord, harmless from and against certain liabilities, damages, claims, costs, penalties, and expenses arising from our conduct related to the premises. We also have a sublease with a subtenant for the remaining lease term at 100 Potrero Avenue, pursuant to which the subtenant is required to reimburse us with respect to the foregoing expenses and taxes with respect to the subleased premises and to indemnify and hold us harmless with respect to the subleased premises in the same manner described above. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that occasionally arise in the normal course of business activities, including claims of alleged infringement of IP rights, commercial, employment, and other matters. In our opinion, resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition. Given the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could materially affect our future operating results or financial condition in a particular period; however, based on the information known by us as of the date of this filing and the rules and regulations applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, any such amounts are either immaterial, or it is not probable that a potential loss has been incurred or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur Class A common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"DLB.\" Our Class B common stock is neither listed nor publicly traded. As of October 27, 2023, there were 93 holders of record of our Class A common stock and 34 holders of record of our Class B common stock. The number of Class A beneficial stockholders is substantially greater than the number of holders of record since a large portion of our common stock is held through brokerage firms.\nDividend Policy\nIn October 2014, we announced a quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders that was initiated by our Board of Directors. Since the program was initiated, a quarterly dividend has been declared and paid to all eligible stockholders of Class A and Class B common stock. Most recently, on November 16, 2023, we announced a dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share, payable on December 5, 2023, to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 28, 2023.\nDividend declarations and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the Board of Directors' continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be changed or canceled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time. For additional information related to our quarterly dividend, see Note 9 \"Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements and Shareholder Return in Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\"\nSales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nIn November 2009, we announced a stock repurchase program (\"program\"), providing for the repurchase of our Class A common stock. Stock repurchases under the program may be made through open market transactions, negotiated purchases, or otherwise, at times and in amounts that we consider appropriate. The timing of repurchases and the number of shares repurchased depend upon a variety of factors, including price, regulatory requirements, the rate of dilution from our equity compensation plans, and other market conditions. The program does not have a specified expiration date, and can be limited, suspended, or terminated at our discretion at any time without prior notice. Shares repurchased under the program will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock.\nThe following table summarizes the initial amount of authorized repurchases as well as additional repurchases approved by our Board of Directors as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands):\nDate of Authorization Authorization Amount\nFiscal 2010: November 2009 $ 250,000\nFiscal 2010: July 2010 300,000\nFiscal 2011: July 2011 250,000\nFiscal 2012: February 2012 100,000\nFiscal 2015: October 2014 200,000\nFiscal 2017: January 2017 200,000\nFiscal 2018: July 2018 350,000\nFiscal 2019: July 2019 350,000\nFiscal 2021: July 2021 350,000\nFiscal 2022: February 2022 250,000\nFiscal 2022: August 2022 350,000\nTotal $ 2,950,000\nThe following table provides information regarding our share repurchases made under this program during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023:\nRepurchase Activity Total Shares Purchased Average Price\nPaid Per Share (1)\nTotal Shares Purchased As Part Of Publicly Announced Programs Remaining Authorized Share Repurchases (2)\nJuly 1, 2023 - July 28, 2023 285,499 $87.57 285,499 $211.6 million\nJuly 29, 2023 - August 25, 2023 - $ - - $211.6 million\nAugust 26, 2023 - September 29, 2023 - $ - - $211.6 million\nTotal 285,499 285,499\n(1)Average price paid per share excludes commission costs.\n(2)Amounts represent the approximate dollar value of the maximum remaining number of shares that may yet be purchased under the stock repurchase program as of the end of the applicable period and excludes commission costs.\nStock Price Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares the total cumulative return of our Class A common stock with the total cumulative return for the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index (\"NYSE Composite\"), the Russell 3000 Index (\"Russell 3000\"), and the S&P MidCap 400 Index (\"S&P 400\") for the five fiscal years ended September 29, 2023. We have elected to replace the Russell 3000 with the S&P 400 because we believe the components of the S&P 400 represent more similar market capitalizations to our own and the S&P 400 will provide a more meaningful comparison of our stock performance going forward. For this transitional year, both the Russell 3000 and the S&P 400 are reflected in the following graph, but we do not expect to include the Russell 3000 in future years. The figures represented below assume an investment of $100 in our Class A common stock at the closing price of $69.97 on September 28, 2018, and in the NYSE Composite, Russell 3000, and S&P 400 on the same date and the reinvestment of dividends into shares of common stock. The comparisons in the table are required by the SEC and are not intended to forecast or be indicative of possible future performance of our Class A common stock. This graph shall not be deemed \"filed\" for purposes of Section 18 of Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (\"Exchange Act\") or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into any of our filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to key challenges listed below and risks described in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We disclaim any duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform our prior statements to actual results.\nInvestors and others should note that we disseminate information to the public about our company, our products, services and other matters through various channels, including our website (www.dolby.com), our investor relations website (http://investor.dolby.com), SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls, and webcasts, in order to achieve broad, non-exclusionary distribution of information to the public. We encourage investors and others to review the information we make public through these channels, as such information could be deemed to be material information.\nMACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nThe current macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted many of our licensees and that directly impacts our financial results. Our revenue has been impacted by macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to, elevated inflation, rising interest rates, restrictions and economic impacts related to COVID-19, supply chain constraints, increased shipping costs, international conflicts, reduced discretionary consumer spending, and reduced new product investment by our customers caused by higher interest rates and lower demand. The macroeconomic conditions also impart substantial uncertainty into our operating environment, which presents additional challenges for our business. These factors and the related uncertainty may cause delays or a decrease in the adoption or implementation of our technologies into new products by partners and licensees. These conditions may impact consumer demand for devices and services and our partners ability to manufacture devices. Further, we may be negatively impacted by delays in transaction cycles and our recoveries efforts due to the noted macroeconomic conditions and related uncertainty. The future implications of these macroeconomic conditions on our business, results of operations and overall financial position remain uncertain. We continue to monitor the evolving macroeconomic environment and the impact on our business. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these macroeconomic effects on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nEXPANDING OUR LEADERSHIP IN AUDIO AND IMAGING EXPERIENCES\nWe are focused on expanding our leadership in audio and imaging solutions for premium entertainment content by increasing the number of Dolby experiences that people can enjoy, which will drive revenue growth across the markets we serve. We can increase our value proposition and create opportunities by broadening Dolby technologies into new types of content, such as music, gaming, live sports, and user-generated content. We are increasingly making our audio and imaging technologies available for content beyond premium entertainment through Dolby.io, creating new revenue generating opportunities. We also seek to expand the reach of our technology by incorporating it into industry standards and offering licenses to our patents covering that technology, along with our partners, through patent pools. The following is a discussion of the key markets that we address and the various Dolby technologies and solutions that serve these markets.\nLICENSING\nThe majority of our licensing revenue is derived from the licensing of audio and imaging technologies for entertainment playback. Our branded technologies are primarily comprised of DD+, Dolby Atmos, and AC-4 for audio, and Dolby Vision for imaging. Our audio technologies offered jointly through patent pools are incorporated into the AAC, HE-AAC, xHE-AAC, MPEG H and Opus standards for audio, and the AVC, HEVC, VVC and AV1 standards for imaging. Licensing revenue is primarily driven by the adoption of our technologies on devices, the number of devices shipped by licensees, and by the expansion of the number of licensees adopting our technologies. DD+, AC-4, and our AAC and HE-AAC audio patents (collectively, our \"foundational audio technologies\") have broad penetration across a diverse set of devices and end markets. Our revenue from these technologies is primarily driven by device shipments from licensees, and as such, is impacted by consumer spending. In the future, we expect revenue from our foundational audio technologies to generally reflect market trends in device shipments. The remaining portion of our licensing revenue is derived from offerings such as Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, our imaging patents, and Dolby Cinema. Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos have not been in the market as long as our foundational audio technologies, thus revenue growth is primarily driven by increased adoption and the addition of new licensees. Revenue from\ntechnologies licensed through our patent licensing model is driven primarily by our royalty share within patent pools, licensee penetration, device shipments, and the introduction of new standardized technologies and patent programs. Factors such as global supply constraints or device lifecycles may also impact licensing revenue generally. Further, in certain countries, we face difficulties enforcing our contractual and IP rights, including instances in which our licensees fail to accurately report the shipment of products using our technologies.\nThe availability of content in Dolby formats is an important part of creating the ecosystems that drive adoption of our technologies within a wide range of devices. Our audio and imaging technologies have a strong presence within movie and episodic content through adoption across content creators and streaming services. The availability of content on these platforms has driven strong adoption in devices such as TVs, STBs, and speaker devices. Our audio and imaging technologies are also widely available through many forms of distribution, including broadcast TV, streaming, and optical disc playback.\nMajor streaming partners and services such as Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+, Amazon, Max, and Paramount+ continue to enhance content in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. For example, in fiscal 2023, Max launched its top tier service with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. These streaming services launch local content in Dolby formats internationally. As we see an increase in new local content, we increase our value proposition for adoption of Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos across devices in all market segments.\nWe work with industry leaders to enhance these forms of content through the use of our technologies, creating additional value for the adoption of Dolby within devices such as mobile phones and tablets, PCs, gaming consoles, and automobiles. We have enhanced a broad range of content, such as music, gaming, live sports, and user-generated content. In the current fiscal year:\nIn music, the Belgian music festival Tomorrowland streamed its festival in Dolby Atmos, and released replay footage of the event on Apple Music in Dolby Atmos. Apple Music launched Apple Music Classical, a new classical music app with Dolby Atmos supported on thousands of recordings, and Amazon Music, which supports Dolby Atmos, began streaming to a wider set of devices, including more wireless speakers, soundbars, and DMAs. WYNK Music, a free music streaming service in India, has made Dolby Atmos Music available to India's Airtel's subscribers.\nIn gaming, the popular mobile game PUBG Mobile was made available to play in Dolby Atmos globally.\nIn sports, the 2022 FIFA World Cup was broadcast internationally by 12 global operators and three free-to-air terrestrial broadcasters in Dolby Vision and/or Dolby Atmos. The 2023 Indian Premier League cricket matches were available in Dolby Atmos through Disney Star and JioCinema. The 2023 French Open available for the very first time in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos via the streaming provider Molotov TV, and the 2023 Wimbledon Championships were broadcast in Dolby Atmos on Sky Germany. The 68th UEFA Champions League games were available in Dolby Atmos. The US Open Tennis Tournament was broadcast in the UK on Sky TV in Dolby Atmos. Comcast broadcast the Superbowl LVII in Dolby Vision, and is broadcasting ESPN's college football game of the week in Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Sky Germany began broadcasting the second Bundesliga in Dolby Atmos. Additionally, Max streamed its Major League Baseball games in Dolby Atmos.\nIn user-generated content, Vivo launched its flagship mobile phone X90 Pro+ with Dolby Vision Capture and playback, further enabling the creation of user-generated content. Weibo, one of China's largest social media platforms, began supporting Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Audiobooks on Audible now support Dolby Atmos. Moj, India's largest short video platform, now supports Dolby Vision, and Viddsee, a short film video platform in Singapore, now supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nThe following are highlights from our fiscal 2023 and key challenges related to audio and imaging licensing, by market. Further discussion of the potential impacts of these key challenges on our business can be found in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nBroadcast\nHighlights: We have an established global presence with respect to our DD+ and HE-AAC audio technologies in broadcast services and devices. We have expanded our offerings in the broadcast market through technologies such as Dolby Atmos and AC-4, Dolby Vision, as well as AVC and HEVC imaging technologies which we license through patent pools. We work with many TV OEMs and strategic partners to enable and promote Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experiences within their TV lineups. Many such partners continue to expand their support of the\ncombined Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos experience. For example, at CES in January 2023, LG announced its TV lineup that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and Hisense announced several new UHD TVs and Laser TVs that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Additionally in fiscal 2023, TCL announced new QLED and Mini-LED TVs with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, and that it is expanding the number of products in its lineup that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in India. We also recently announced that our new feature Dolby Atmos FlexConnect will be supported by TCL's 2024 TV lineup. Acer launched TVs with DD+, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos in India. Polytron, the largest TV OEM in Indonesia, launched TVs that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. Hoichoi, an Indian OTT, adopted Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision.\nKey Challenges: Our pursuit of new licensees and further adoption of our technologies by existing licensees may be impacted by a number of factors. We must continue to present compelling reasons for consumers to demand our audio and imaging technologies, including ensuring that there is a breadth of available content in our formats and such content is being widely distributed. To the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products or our technology is not included in future broadcast industry standards, our revenue could be negatively impacted. Changing trends in the way that video content is distributed and consumed may impact our business and future growth in the broadcast market, such as the trend away from subscription-based cable and satellite television providers toward streaming services. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements.\nMobile\nHighlights: We continue to focus on adoption of our technologies across major mobile ecosystems, including Apple and Android. HE-AAC and HEVC are widely adopted audio and video technologies across mobile devices, and we offer these technologies through our patent licensing programs. We also continue to focus on expanding adoption of our DD+, AC-4, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision technologies in the mobile market. The breadth of mobile devices supporting Dolby technologies continues to increase globally. In fiscal 2023, OPPO launched the OnePlus 11, its first phone that supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. In addition, OPPO launched its first flagship phone with Dolby Vision Capture, and OnePlus launched its first phone with Dolby Vision playback and Dolby Atmos. Xiaomi, which now has multiple Dolby Vision Capture phone models in China, began shipping Dolby Vision Capture phone models in India, Southeast Asia, Europe and the Middle East during the year. Also in fiscal 2023, Vivo began shipping Dolby Vision Capture phones in China. Motorola became our latest partner to announce and start shipping its first Dolby Vision playback phone globally. Honor, a Chinese smart phone manufacturer, recently launched smart phones that support Dolby Vision playback.\nKey Challenges: Growth in this market is dependent on several factors. Due to short product life cycles, mobile device OEMs can readily add or remove certain of our technologies from their devices. Our success depends on our ability to address the rapid pace of change in mobile devices, and we must continuously collaborate with mobile device OEMs to incorporate our technologies. The mobile market is heavily concentrated, so we rely on a small number of partnerships with key participants in this market. If we are unable to maintain these key relationships, we may experience a decline in mobile devices incorporating our technologies. To the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products or our technology is not included in future mobile industry standards, our revenue could be impacted. We must also continue to support the development and distribution of Dolby-enabled content via various ecosystems. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements.\nConsumer Electronics\nHighlights: We have an established presence in the home entertainment market across devices such as AVRs, soundbars, wireless and smart speakers, DMAs, and Blu-Ray players, through the inclusion of our DD+ technology, and increasingly through the inclusion of Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision. AAC and HE-AAC technologies also have broad adoption through our patent licensing programs. We continue to focus on expanding the availability of Dolby technologies to new devices. At CES in January 2023, LG and Samsung each announced 2023 soundbar lineups that support Dolby Atmos. Also in fiscal 2023, Sonos launched their premium smart speaker, the Sonos Era 300, with Dolby Atmos. Zebronics announced a new soundbar that supports Dolby Atmos to be sold in India. Jabra launched headphone products that support Dolby Atmos. XGIMI announced the 4K long throw home projector with Dolby Vision.\nKey Challenges: We must continue to present compelling reasons for consumers to demand our technologies wherever they enjoy entertainment content, while promoting creation and broad availability of content in our formats.\nTo the extent that OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in current and future products, our revenue could be impacted. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements.\nPersonal Computers\nHighlights: DD+ continues to enhance audio playback in both Mac and Windows operating systems, including native support in their respective Safari and Microsoft Edge browsers. Dolby's presence in these browsers enables us to reach more users through various types of content, including streaming video entertainment. A number of PCs from partners such as Apple, Lenovo, Dell, Samsung, and ASUS also support Dolby Vision and/or Dolby Atmos, with continued expansion of applications through music, streaming, and gaming. In fiscal 2023, Tencent's streaming music platform QQ Music launched Dolby Atmos support in Mac operating systems. Also in fiscal 2023, Microsoft launched its latest tablets that support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.\nKey Challenges: Demand for PCs has recently been declining and it remains uncertain when, if, and to what extent PC demand will return to historic levels. We must continuously collaborate and maintain our key partnerships with PC manufacturers to incorporate our technologies, and we must continue to support the development and distribution of Dolby content via various ecosystems. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements.\nOther Markets\nHighlights: DD+ is incorporated in the Xbox and PlayStation gaming consoles that support gaming content and streaming for movie and television content. The Xbox Series X and Series S gaming consoles support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos for streaming and gaming content. Additionally, our technologies continue to be incorporated into the latest headphones by various OEMs. In fiscal 2023, Sony Interactive Entertainment announced that PlayStation 5 is unlocking support for compatible Dolby Atmos-enabled living room devices with the latest PS5 system software beta, available to beta participants in select markets. Sony Interactive Entertainment also announced support for Dolby Atmos on the PS5.\nWe also generate revenue from the automotive industry through disc playback devices as well as other elements of the entertainment system, and through the adoption of Dolby Atmos Music. In fiscal 2023, Mercedes-Benz adopted Dolby Atmos and Dolby Atmos Music in several of its car models, and continues to add our technologies to more models and ship more models globally. Also in fiscal 2023, Chinese electric car manufacturer Li Auto and NetEase Cloud Music announced a collaboration to deliver Dolby Atmos Music in Li Auto cars. Additionally, Guangzhou Automobile Group, a large Chinese auto manufacturer, announced the launch of a new sport sedan that features Dolby Atmos, and NIO and Lotus launched cars that support Dolby Atmos beyond the domestic Chinese market into Europe as well. Yangwang announced its first car, the Yangwang U8 model, supporting Dolby Atmos, our fifth automotive OEM this year.\nKey Challenges: Consumer demand for devices in the gaming industry is impacted by anticipation of console refresh cycles, which could result in fluctuations in our revenue. In addition, the gaming console market has competition from mobile devices and gaming PCs, which have faster refresh cycles and appeal to a broader consumer base. Automotive revenue has been negatively impacted by a decline in the portion of cars that have optical disc playback. Shortages of certain semiconductor components could result in lower implementation of our technologies in vehicles by automotive manufacturers. Our revenue growth will be impacted if OEMs do not incorporate our technologies in their latest products, which can be more prominent in industries with longer development cycles such as the automotive industry. Additionally, we face geopolitical challenges including changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, trade protection measures, and import or export licensing requirements.\nIncluded within Other Markets is also licensing revenue from audio and imaging technologies used to create Dolby experiences through Dolby Cinema.\nDolby Cinema\nHighlights: We continue to expand our global presence for Dolby Cinema, with sites located in the U.S. and internationally. The breadth of motion pictures for Dolby Cinema continues to grow with over 500 theatrical titles in both Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos having been announced or released from all of the major studios as of the end of fiscal 2023.\nKey Challenges: Although the premium large format market for the cinema industry has been growing, Dolby Cinema competes with other existing offerings. Our success depends on our partners and their success, and our ability to differentiate our offering, deploy new sites, and attract and retain a global viewing audience. In addition, the success of our Dolby Cinema offering is tied to global box office performance generally. COVID-19 has had a significant effect on theatrical exhibition, which could impact the financial viability of our key partners. The response to COVID-19 has had a negative impact on our cinema-related revenue and consumer demand, although consumer demand for the cinema has been improving. It is uncertain whether consumer demand for the cinema will return to previous levels. Additionally, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may result in near-term decreases in box office receipts and our cinema-related revenue.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nA majority of our products and services revenue is derived from the sale of audio and imaging products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Revenue from Dolby.io is also included in products and services.\nCinema Products and Services\nHighlights: To help enable the playback of content in Dolby formats, we offer a range of servers, which include the IMS3000 (an integrated imaging and audio server with Dolby Atmos), and audio processors, such as the CP950, to cinema exhibitors globally. Dolby Atmos has been adopted broadly across studios, content creators, post-production facilities, and exhibitors. As of the end of fiscal 2023, there are over 7,500 Dolby Atmos screens installed or committed and over 2,800 Dolby Atmos theatrical titles have been announced or released.\nWe also offer a variety of other cinema products, such as the Dolby Multichannel Amplifier and our high-power flexible line of speakers. These products allow us to offer exhibitors a more complete Dolby Atmos solution that is often more cost effective than other commercially available options.\nKey Challenges: Demand for our cinema products is dependent upon our partners and their success in the market, industry and economic cycles, box office performance, and our ability to develop and introduce new technologies, further our relationships with content creators, and promote new cinematic audio and imaging experiences. A significant portion of our growth opportunity lies in international markets, which are subject to geopolitical risks. Additionally, weakness in general economic conditions due to inflation, recession, pandemic or other worsening economic conditions could have a negative impact on our cinema-related revenue due to reduced consumer discretionary spending. We may also be faced with pricing pressures or competing technologies, which would affect our revenue. We have also experienced supply chain shortages and increased shipping costs that have created challenges to maintain the sufficient supply of cinema products to meet the demand in the market. In addition, supply chain constraints may impact our ability to provide cinema products and services to our customers. COVID-19 has also negatively impacted the financial health of our cinema customers and partners. In addition, the recently concluded strikes by the Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA effectively halted the production, release and promotion of certain films for an extended period. The resulting impacts of those stoppages may lead to decreased box office receipts in the near term, which could potentially impact exhibitors' willingness and ability to invest in our cinema products.\nDolby.io\nHighlights: We are focused on bringing Dolbys decades of sight and sound technology to a broader range of media content and digital experiences. We are expanding our addressable market to enhance a broader range of content, by offering solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Our solution provides the capability to stream high quality audiovisual content in ultra-low latency which reduces the delay between the action and the viewer.\nContent being delivered with almost no delay enables our customers to create real-time interaction in their apps and services. This lifelike interaction is essential to the experiences companies, particularly in sports and entertainment, are creating.\nOver time, we believe this way of delivering and engaging with content will be used more broadly.\nKey Challenges: Dolby.io is an early-stage business, and it is uncertain when or if it will be a material revenue driver. Our success in this market will depend on adoption from companies building real-time digital experiences that\nincrease audience engagement, the volume of usage of the services and our ability to monetize our services. In addition, the development and maintenance needed to provide a reliable and scalable platform may require us to develop new skills internally for our current employees or hire external specialized talent. Although the market for real-time experiences has been growing, Dolby.io competes with other offerings.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to establish accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses. The SEC considers an accounting policy and estimate to be critical if it is both important to a companys financial condition or results of operations and requires significant judgment by management in its application. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments, and estimates, and historically, actual results have not differed significantly from them. If actual results or events differ materially from our judgments and estimates, our reported financial condition and results of operation for future periods could be materially affected. We have reviewed the selection and development of the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from the licensing of our technologies and patents. In determining how revenue should be recognized, a five-step process is used, which requires judgment and estimates within the revenue recognition process. Generally, revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products, services or IP rights to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products, services or licensing of the IP rights. The primary judgments include estimating sales-based revenue in advance of receiving statements from our licensees, estimating variable consideration, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, and determining whether the performance obligations are distinct, and allocating consideration accordingly.\nMost of our licensing arrangements are structured as sales-based whereby we are paid a unit-based royalty. The unit-based sales data that triggers the royalty obligation is generally reported to us in the quarter after triggering the royalty obligation. We apply the royalty exception to these arrangements, which requires that we recognize sales-based royalties at the later of when the sales occur based on our estimates or the completion of our performance obligations. Our estimates of royalty-based revenue take into consideration the macroeconomic effect of global events, such as inflation, elevated interest rates, economic impacts related to COVID-19, or other economic conditions, which may impact supply chain activities as well as demand for shipments. These estimates also involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our technologies, and average sale prices. Generally, our estimates represent the current periods shipments for which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements in the following quarter. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we previously estimated, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales.\nWe also enter into fixed and guaranteed licensing fees arrangements, which require the licensee to pay a fixed, non-refundable fee. In these cases, control is transferred and the transaction price - the amount we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the license right - is recognized upon the later of contract execution or the effective date. Transaction price is determined at contract execution and, to the extent variable consideration applies, is updated each subsequent reporting period until the completion of the contract. We evaluate whether other distinct performance obligations exist, such as PCS, and determine the stand-alone selling price. We do so by considering actual stand-alone sales in addition to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies, customer specific information and industry technology lifecycles, internal conditions such as cost and pricing practices, or applying the residual approach method when the selling price of the good, most commonly a license, is highly variable or uncertain. In addition, we evaluate whether a significant financing component exists when we recognize revenue in advance of customer payments that occur over time and extend beyond one year. In general, if the payment arrangements extend beyond the first year of the contract, we treat a portion of the payments as a financing component. The discount rate used for each arrangement reflects the rate that would be used in a separate financing transaction between us and the licensee at contract inception and takes into account the credit characteristics of the licensee and market interest rates as of the date of the agreement. If we assess the financing component to be significant to the contract, the amount of fixed fee revenue recognized at the beginning of the license term will be reduced by the calculated\nfinancing component. The portion related to the financing component is recorded as interest income, and is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nFor additional information, see Note 3 \"Revenue Recognition\" to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIMPACT OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED\nFor information on recent accounting standards that have not been adopted yet and the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements, refer to Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor each line item included on our consolidated statements of operations described and analyzed below, the significant factors identified as the leading drivers contributing to the overall fluctuation are presented in descending order of their impact on the overall change (from an absolute value perspective). This discussion and analysis highlights comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022. For the discussion and analysis highlighting comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2022 and September 24, 2021, refer to Part II, Item 7 \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is incorporated herein by reference. Note that adjustments related to sales-based royalties that were misreported by licensees as well as unlicensed settlement activity, are collectively referred to as \"recoveries.\" Amounts displayed, except percentages, are in thousands.\nRevenue and Gross Margin\nLicensing\nLicensing revenue consists of fees earned from licensing our technologies to customers who incorporate them into their products and services to enable and enhance audio and imaging capabilities. The technologies that we license are either internally developed, acquired, or licensed from third parties. We also generate administrative fees for managing patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners through our subsidiary, Via LA. A significant portion of our licensing revenue pertains to customer-shipment royalties that we recognize based on estimates of our licensees shipments. To the extent that shipment data reported by licensees differs from estimates we made and recorded, we recognize an adjustment to revenue for such difference in the period we receive the reported shipment data.\nOur cost of licensing consists mainly of amortization of certain purchased intangible assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations, depreciation, third party royalty obligations, and patent pool fees.\nFiscal Year Ended Change\nLicensing September 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 $ %\nRevenue $1,197,930 $1,164,533 $33,397 3%\nPercentage of total revenue 92% 93%\nCost of licensing 64,890 61,597 3,293 5%\nGross margin 1,133,040 1,102,936 30,104 3%\nGross margin percentage 95% 95%\nFiscal Year Ended\nLicensing Revenue By Market September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nBroadcast $ 451,719 38 % $ 433,992 37 %\nMobile 243,897 20 % 238,735 21 %\nCE 170,197 14 % 186,285 16 %\nPC 124,362 10 % 151,079 13 %\nOther 207,755 18 % 154,442 13 %\nTotal licensing revenue $ 1,197,930 100 % $ 1,164,533 100 %\nFactor Licensing Revenue Gross Margin\nOther \u00e1 Higher revenue from imaging patent pool administrative fees, higher revenue due to gaming console shipments, higher automotive revenue driven by higher adoption of Dolby Atmos \u00df\u00e0 No significant fluctuations\nPC \u00e2 Lower revenue driven by lower shipments and lower recoveries, primarily from foundational audio technologies, partially offset by higher revenue from our imaging patent programs\nBroadcast \u00e1 Higher revenue from our imaging patent programs, partially offset by lower unit shipments primarily in STBs, impacting revenue from foundational audio technologies\nCE \u00e2 Lower revenue from unit shipments in DMAs, and lower revenue due to timing of minimum volume commitments, primarily impacting revenue from foundational audio technologies, partially offset by higher revenue from our imaging patent programs\nMobile \u00e1 Higher revenue from new licensees in our audio patent programs and increased adoption of Dolby Vision, partially offset by lower revenue from minimum volume commitments\nProducts and Services\nProducts revenue is generated from the sale of audio and imaging hardware and software products for the cinema, television, broadcast and entertainment industries.

The extent of our costs arising as a result of these actions, including fluctuations in related balances between fiscal periods, is based on the nature of activities under the various plans.\nFiscal Year Ended Change\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 $ %\nRestructuring charges $47,061 $10,623 $36,438 343%\nPercentage of total revenue 4% 1%\nIn June 2023, we implemented a focused restructuring plan, primarily consisting of workforce reductions and facility consolidations to improve execution in alignment with our strategy and to reduce our cost structure through improved utilization of our global infrastructure. As a result of these actions, we recorded restructuring charges of $10.9 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 130 impacted employees and $6.9 million related to facility consolidation in New York, NY.\nIn September 2023, we initiated a focused restructuring plan with the purpose of focusing our resources on our highest strategic priorities. We recorded expense of $13.4 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 160 impacted employees. The remaining components of this plan are expected to be completed in November 2023, resulting in an additional charge of approximately $5.0 million in severance and other termination benefits. In conjunction with focusing our resources on our top strategic priorities, we recorded an impairment loss of $16.9 million related primarily to internally developed software for projects we are no longer pursuing.\nFor additional information on our Restructuring programs, see Note 13 \"Restructuring\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income/Expense\nOther income/expense primarily consists of interest income earned on cash and investments and the net gains or losses from foreign currency transactions, derivative instruments, our proportionate share of net income or losses from our equity method investment, and gains and losses on the sales of marketable securities from our investment portfolio.\nFiscal Year Ended Change\nOther income/(expense) September 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 $ %\nInterest income $28,086 $6,174 $21,912 355%\nOther income, net 6,214 2,500 3,714 149%\nTotal $34,300 $8,674 $25,626 295%\nCategory Key Drivers\nInterest Income \u00e1 Higher yields on current year investment balances due to increased interest rates\nOther Income \u00e1 Higher income primarily due to higher yields on our SERP balances in the current year, and higher foreign currency transaction gains\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate is based on our fiscal year results and is affected by several factors. These include the current statutory rates in our domestic and foreign jurisdictions, the relative income earned in our foreign jurisdictions, and nonrecurring items such as changes to our unrecognized tax benefits that may occur in but are not necessarily consistent between periods. For additional information related to effective tax rates, see Note 12 \"Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nProvision for income taxes $(48,409) $(31,381)\nEffective tax rate 19% 15%\nFactor Impact On Effective Tax Rate\nStock-based Compensation \u00e1 Lower benefit related to the settlement of stock-based awards.\nResearch and Development \u00e1 Lower benefit from R&D tax credits.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES, AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, and investments, as well as cash flows from operations. We believe that these sources will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nAs of September 29, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $745.4 million, which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds. In addition, we had short and long-term investments of $237.0 million, which primarily consisted of government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal debt securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. agency securities.\nThe following table presents selected financial information as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nCash and cash equivalents $ 745,364 $ 620,127\nShort-term investments 139,148 189,213\nLong-term investments 97,812 102,514\nAccounts receivable, net 262,245 243,593\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities 372,324 244,408\nWorking capital 1,065,578 1,033,376\nCapital Expenditures and Uses of Capital\nOur capital expenditures consist of purchases of land, building, building fixtures, laboratory equipment, office equipment, computer hardware and software, leasehold improvements, and production and test equipment. Additionally, included in capital expenditures are amounts associated with Dolby Cinema locations. We continue to invest in S&M and R&D to promote the overall growth of our business and technological innovation.\nWe retain sufficient cash holdings to support our operations and we also purchase investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries, and issuers. We have used cash generated from our operations to fund a variety of activities related to our business in addition to our ongoing operations, including business expansion and growth, acquisitions, and repurchases of our Class A common stock. We have historically generated significant cash from operations. However, these cash flows and the value of our investment portfolio could be affected by various risks and uncertainties, as described in Part I, Item 1A \"Risk Factors.\"\nShareholder Return\nWe have returned cash to stockholders through both repurchases of Class A common stock under our repurchase program initiated in fiscal 2010 and our quarterly dividend program initiated in fiscal 2015. Refer to Note 9 \"Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation\" to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of dividend payments made under the program during fiscal 2023 and additional information regarding our stock repurchase program.\nStock Repurchase Program. Our stock repurchase program was approved in fiscal 2010, and since then we have completed approximately $2.7 billion of stock repurchases under the program.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act were signed into law in August 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act introduced a one percent non-deductible excise tax on certain public company stock buybacks made after December 31, 2022. We do not currently expect the excise tax to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position, and its ongoing impact will be dependent on the extent of our future net stock repurchase activities.\nQuarterly Dividend Program. During fiscal 2015, we initiated a recurring quarterly cash dividend program for our stockholders. For fiscal 2023, quarterly dividends of $0.27 per share were paid on our Class A and Class B common stock to eligible stockholders of record.\nCash Flows Analysis\nFor the following comparative analysis performed for each of the sections of the consolidated statements of cash flows, the significant factors identified as the leading drivers contributing to the fluctuation are presented in descending order of their impact relative to the overall change (in thousands).\nOperating Activities\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 367,081 $ 318,576\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $48.5 million in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\nFactor Impact On Cash Flows\nOperating assets and liabilities \u00e1 Higher inflows due to lower accounts receivable and higher operating lease liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities and lower income taxes\nInvesting Activities\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities $ 54,206 $ (295,935)\nNet cash provided by/(used in) investing activities was $350.1 million higher in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\nFactor Impact On Cash Flows\nPurchase of Investments \u00e1 Lower outflows for the purchase of marketable investment securities\nProceeds from Investments \u00e1 Higher inflows from the sale and maturity of marketable investment securities\nBusiness Combinations \u00e1 Inflows due to restricted cash balances acquired in connection with the MPEG LA acquisition\nFinancing Activities\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nNet cash used in financing activities $ (236,812) $ (610,558)\nNet cash used in financing activities was $373.7 million lower in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to the following:\nFactor Impact On Cash Flows\nShare Repurchases \u00e1 Lower outflows due to lower common stock repurchases\nCommon Stock Issuance \u00e2 Lower inflows from employee stock option exercises\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayments Due By Fiscal Period\n1 Year 2 - 3\nYears 4 - 5\nYears More Than\n5 Years Total\nNaming rights $ 12,794 $ 26,598 $ 17,176 $ 35,674 $ 92,242\nPurchase obligations 29,934 4,667 - - 34,601\nDonation commitments 1,718 232 172 332 2,454\nTotal $ 44,446 $ 31,497 $ 17,348 $ 36,006 $ 129,297\nNaming Rights. We are party to agreements for naming rights of certain facilities, most significantly for naming rights and related benefits with respect to the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, the location of the Academy Awards\u00ae. The term of the agreement is 20 years, over which we will make payments on a semi-annual basis until fiscal 2032. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos. For additional details regarding our naming rights commitments, see Note 14 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nOperating Leases. Operating lease payments represent our commitments for future minimum rent made under non-cancelable leases for office space, including those payable to our principal stockholder and portions attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. For additional details regarding our leases, see Note 7 \"Leases\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nPurchase Obligations. Purchase obligations primarily consist of our non-cancelable commitments made under agreements to purchase goods and services related to Dolby Cinema and for purposes that include information technology and telecommunications, marketing and professional services, and manufacturing and other R&D activities.\nDonation Commitments. Our donation commitments relate to non-cancelable obligations that consist of maintenance services and installation of imaging and audio products in exchange for various marketing, branding, and publicity benefits. For additional details regarding our donation commitments, see Note 14 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. As of September 29, 2023, we had an accrued liability for unrecognized tax benefits without interest, penalties, and related deferred tax assets, totaling $76.3 million. We are unable to estimate when any cash settlement with a taxing authority might occur and, therefore, have not reflected these anticipated future outflows in the table above.\nIndemnification Clauses\nWe are party to certain contractual agreements under which we have agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and duration to the other party relating to our licensed IP. Since the terms and conditions of the indemnification clauses do not explicitly specify our obligations, we are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure for which we could be liable. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. For additional details regarding indemnification clauses within our contractual agreements, see Note 14 \"Commitments and Contingencies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn fiscal 2023, there have been no material changes in either our off-balance sheet financing arrangements or contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business, and we did not enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements that are expected to have a material effect on Dolby's liquidity or the availability of capital resources. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Sensitivity\nAs of September 29, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $745.4 million, which consisted of cash and highly liquid money market funds. In addition, we had both short and long-term investments of $237.0 million, which consisted of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal debt securities, U.S. agency securities, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. Our investment policy is focused on the preservation of capital and support for our\nliquidity requirements. Under the policy, we invest in highly rated securities with a minimum credit rating of A- while limiting the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer other than the U.S. government. As of September 29, 2023, the weighted-average credit quality of our investment portfolio was AA-, with a weighted-average maturity of approximately eleven months. We do not invest in financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments. We utilize external investment managers who adhere to the guidelines of our investment policy.\nThe investments within our fixed-income portfolio are subject to fluctuations in interest rates, which could affect our financial position, and to a lesser extent, results of operations. Based on our investment portfolio balance as of September 29, 2023, hypothetical changes in interest rates of 1% and 0.5% would have an impact on the carrying value of our portfolio of approximately $1.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nWe maintain business operations in foreign countries, most significantly in Australia, China, Germany, Ireland, Poland, and the U.K. Additionally, a portion of our business is conducted outside of the U.S. through subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, most notably:\nAustralian Dollar\nBritish Pound\nChinese Yuan\nEuro\nPolish Zloty\nAs a result, we face exposure to adverse movements in currency exchange rates as the financial results of our international operations are translated from local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. The majority of our revenue generated from international markets is denominated in U.S. dollars, while the operating expenses of our foreign subsidiaries are predominantly denominated in local currencies. Therefore, our operating expenses will increase when the U.S. dollar weakens against the local currency and decrease when the U.S. dollar strengthens against the local currency. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency result in gains or losses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Our foreign operations are subject to the same risks present when conducting business internationally, including, but not limited to, changes in economic conditions and geopolitical climate, differing tax structures, foreign exchange rate volatility and other regulations and restrictions.\nWe also enter into forward currency contracts exclusively designated as cash flow hedges, which have a maturity of thirteen months or less, to reduce the impact of currency volatility on U.S. dollar operating expenses. The gains and losses from the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as a component of AOCI, until the hedged item is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, with the corresponding hedged item. Amounts reclassified are recorded to the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedge transaction, concurrently with the hedged costs.\nThe pre-tax gain attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was $4.9 million in fiscal 2023. The pre-tax loss attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was $2.6 million in fiscal 2022.\nThe pre-tax effective portion of the losses reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was $0.7 million in fiscal 2023, and the pre-tax effective portion of the loss reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was $2.1 million in fiscal 2022.\nWe also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure and selected anticipated expenses. The contracts hedging receivables and payables are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other income/(expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations. The contracts hedging foreign currency denominated operating expenses are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other comprehensive income until the hedged expenses are reported in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of September 29, 2023, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of equal to or less than 12 months. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $134.8 million and $130.8 million, respectively.\nFor additional information related to our foreign currency forward contracts, see Note 2 \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nA sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign currency forward contracts as of September 29, 2023. This sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. For these forward contracts, duration modeling was used where hypothetical changes were made to the spot rates of the currency. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. dollar would lead to a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments by $7.0 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these financial instruments by $7.0 million. ITEM 8. CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDOLBY LABORATORIES, INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 185)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nDolby Laboratories, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dolby Laboratories, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 29, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nThe Company acquired MPEG LA, L.L.C. during fiscal 2023. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, MPEG LA, L.L.C.s internal control over financial reporting which represented 12% of total assets and less than 1.5% of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 29, 2023. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of MPEG LA, L.L.C..\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of revenue estimate related to sales-based licensing arrangements\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is derived principally from the licensing of technologies and patents to various types of licensees. The Company recognized total licensing revenue of $1.2 billion for the year ended September 29, 2023. The Company estimates and records sales-based licensing revenue from its licensees shipments in the same period in which those shipments occur. After receiving the royalty statements from the licensees, which is generally in the quarter after those shipments have occurred, the Company will record an adjustment based on the difference between the estimated and actual sales-based licensing revenue.\nWe identified the assessment of the revenue estimates related to the Companys sales-based licensing arrangements as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgement was required to evaluate the Companys estimation of sales-based licensing revenue, which included the use of historical data, industry estimates of expected shipments, market penetration, and average sales prices.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys sales-based licensing revenue estimation process. This included controls related to the review of (1) historical data, (2) third-party industry expectations for shipments of units, (3) the estimated percentage of market penetration, and (4) estimated average sales prices. We tested the Companys process to develop the sales-based licensing revenue estimate. Specifically, we evaluated the sources of the historical data and assumptions that the Company used by considering their relevance and reliability. We performed sensitivity analyses over certain assumptions to assess the impact on the sales-based licensing revenue estimate of reasonably possible changes to the assumptions. In addition, we compared the Companys historical sales-based licensing revenue estimates to actual sales-based licensing royalties received from licensees during the year, to assess the Companys ability to accurately estimate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2002.\nSan Francisco, California\nNovember 16, 2023\nDOLBY LABORATORIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 745,364 $ 620,127\nRestricted cash 72,602 8,244\nShort-term investments 139,148 189,213\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for credit losses of $9,683 and $11,834\n262,245 243,593\nContract assets, net of allowance for credit losses of $138 and $125\n182,130 176,093\nInventories, net 35,623 23,549\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 50,692 50,075\nTotal current assets 1,487,804 1,310,894\nLong-term investments 97,812 102,514\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 481,581 513,481\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 40,199 46,530\nIntangible assets, net 167,427 112,265\nGoodwill 408,409 365,147\nDeferred taxes 201,860 183,568\nOther non-current assets 94,674 55,149\nTotal assets $ 2,979,766 $ 2,689,548\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 20,925 $ 14,171\nAccrued liabilities 351,399 230,237\nIncome taxes payable 4,769 1,265\nContract liabilities 31,505 18,588\nOperating lease liabilities 13,628 13,257\nTotal current liabilities 422,226 277,518\nNon-current contract liabilities 39,997 23,203\nNon-current operating lease liabilities 37,020 37,685\nOther non-current liabilities 108,339 100,122\nTotal liabilities 607,582 438,528\nStockholders equity:\nClass A, $0.001 par value, one vote per share, 500,000,000 shares authorized: 59,673,633 shares issued and outstanding as of September 29, 2023 and 59,798,862 as of September 30, 2022\n53 53\nClass B, $0.001 par value, ten votes per share, 500,000,000 shares authorized: 36,085,779 shares issued and outstanding as of September 29, 2023 and 36,085,779 as of September 30, 2022\n41 41\nRetained earnings 2,391,990 2,297,730\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (36,984) (51,641)\nTotal stockholders equity -

Basis of Presentation\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dolby Laboratories, Inc. and our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries. In addition, we have consolidated the financial results of jointly owned affiliated companies in which our principal stockholder or other entities have a noncontrolling interest. We report these noncontrolling interests as a separate line in our consolidated statements of operations as net income attributable to noncontrolling interest and in our consolidated balance sheets as a noncontrolling interest. We eliminate all intercompany accounts and transactions upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nSignificant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include estimated shipments by our licensees for which we are owed a sales-based royalty. These estimates involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our technologies, and average sale prices. Our estimates of royalty-based revenue also take into consideration the macroeconomic effect of global events that may impact our licensees' supply chain activities as well as demand for shipments.\nAdditional significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include ESPs for performance obligations within revenue arrangements; allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable; carrying values of inventories and certain PP&E, goodwill and intangible assets; fair values of investments; accrued liabilities including unrecognized tax benefits, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and contingent liabilities; and stock-based compensation. Actual results could differ from our estimates.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is a 52 or 53 week period ending on the last Friday in September. The fiscal years presented herein include the 52 week period ended September 29, 2023 (fiscal 2023) and September 24, 2021 (fiscal 2021), and the 53 week period ended September 30, 2022 (fiscal 2022). Our fiscal year ending September 27, 2024 (fiscal 2024) will consist of 52 weeks.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk principally consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, investments, accounts receivable, and contract assets. We maintain cash, cash equivalents, and investments with multiple financial institutions that have high credit standing, and that we believe are financially sound and have minimal credit risk exposure, although at times our balances may exceed the applicable insurance coverage limits. We monitor and manage the overall counterparty credit risk exposure of our cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. Our investment portfolio consists of investment-grade securities diversified amongst security types, industries, and issuers. All of our securities are held in custody by large national financial institutions. Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to a maximum of 5% of our total portfolio to any one issuer, except for the U.S. Treasury, and we believe no significant concentration risk exists with respect to these investments. We also mitigate counterparty risk through entering into derivative contracts with high-credit-quality financial institutions. Actual or potential defaults of one or more financial institutions could impact our results of operations or financial position, and make it challenging to find alternative qualified counterparties.\nThe majority of our licensing revenue is generated from customers outside of the U.S. We manage the credit risk posed by non-U.S. customers by performing regular evaluations of the creditworthiness of our licensing customers and recognize revenue in accordance with US GAAP.\nIn fiscal 2023 and 2021, we did not have any individual customers that accounted for 10% of our total revenue. For fiscal 2022, we had one individual customer whose revenue exceeded 10% of our total revenue.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of funds held in general checking accounts, money market accounts, and U.S. agency securities.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets consists of royalties payable to third-party licensors through certain Via LA-administered patent pools. Restricted cash also consists of cash contributed by Dolby and third-party licensors to Via LA, our subsidiary, that may only be used for licensor enforcement actions or licensee compliance activities related to certain Via LA-administered patent pools, as well as to disperse costs associated with any audit of Via LA for the Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA) patent pool.\nInvestments\nAll of our investments are classified as AFS, with the exception of our mutual fund investments held in our SERP, which are classified as trading securities, and our equity securities. Investments that have an original maturity of 91 days or more at the date of purchase and a current maturity of less than one year are classified as short-term investments, while investments with a current maturity of more than one year are classified as long-term investments. Our AFS securities and trading securities are recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on our AFS securities are reported as a component of AOCI, while realized gains and losses and credit losses are reported as a component of net income. Upon sale, gains and losses are reclassified from AOCI into earnings, and are determined based on specific identification of securities sold.\nWe evaluate our investment portfolio for impairment by comparing the fair value with the cost basis for each of our investment securities. If the fair value of our AFS securities is less than amortized cost, such securities are considered impaired. If we have the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost, the difference between the amortized cost (net of allowance, if any) and the fair value of the securities is reported as an impairment loss in net income. Impaired AFS securities that we intend to hold are evaluated to determine whether we need to recognize an allowance for credit losses, limited to the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of the security.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities for which we possess the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financing decisions are accounted for under the equity method. In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease the carrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the investee's net earnings or losses. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of the investment. Our share of the equity method investee's net income or loss is included in other income/(expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, and was $5.1 million, $5.0 million, and $4.7 million in fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. Our equity method investment is included within long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also hold an investment in an equity security of a privately-held company without a readily determinable fair value. We elected to account for this investment using the measurement alternative, which is cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. We perform a qualitative assessment at each reporting date to determine whether there are triggering events for impairment. This equity security is included within long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe maintain a provision for estimated credit losses on receivables resulting from our customers' inability to make required payments. In determining the provision, we pool receivables with similar risk characteristics to evaluate the collectability of our receivables. Risk characteristics considered in creating these risk pools include assessing historical or expected loss patterns, credit ratings, current macroeconomic conditions that could impact collectability of cash flows, and structure of customer agreements. In cases where circumstances have changed such that specific\ncustomers no longer share similar risk characteristics, customers are excluded from their current pool and their risk profiles are evaluated separately. We recognize allowances for credit losses based on our actual historical loss information, the current business environment, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates.\nInventories\nInventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence. Our evaluation includes the analysis of future sales demand by product within specific time horizons. Inventories in excess of projected future demand are written down to their net realizable value. In addition, we assess the impact of changing technology on our inventory balances and write-off inventories that are considered obsolete. Write-downs and write-offs of inventory are recorded as a cost of products in our consolidated statements of operations. We classify inventory that we do not expect to sell within twelve months as other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nPP&E is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis according to estimated useful lives assigned to each of our different categories of PP&E as summarized within the following table:\nPP&E Category Useful Life\nComputer equipment and software 3 to 5 years\nMachinery and equipment 3 to 8 years\nFurniture and fixtures 5 to 8 years\nLeasehold improvements Lesser of useful life or related lease term\nEquipment provided under operating leases 15 years\nBuildings and building improvements 20 to 40 years\nWe may encounter scenarios where assets we acquire may deviate from the established standard useful life provided above. Such occurrences are evaluated on a case by case basis, and are assigned a useful life commensurate with the facts and circumstances associated with the specific PP&E being acquired. We capitalize certain costs incurred during the construction phase of a project or asset into construction-in-progress until the construction process is complete. Once the related asset is placed into service, we transfer its carrying value into the appropriate fixed asset category and begin depreciating the value over its useful life.\nEquipment Provided Under Operating Leases. In arrangements that we assess as operating leases, we recognize our equipment installed at third-party sites as PP&E and depreciate the asset on a straight-line basis.\nInternal Use Software. We capitalize qualifying internal-use software development costs, consisting primarily of external and internal labor, including stock based compensation, incurred during the application development stage. Costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are charged to expense. Capitalized costs are included in PP&E, net of accumulated amortization in our consolidated balance sheets. Our capitalized internal use software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of three years, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the softwares useful life.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets, and Long-Lived Assets\nWe perform an assessment of goodwill for potential impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. For our annual goodwill test as of the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023, a qualitative assessment was performed and we concluded that it was more likely than not that its fair value was in excess of its carrying amount. Accordingly, no quantitative assessment was performed and no impairment was recorded. We did not incur any goodwill impairment losses in any of the periods presented.\nIntangible assets are stated at their original cost less accumulated amortization, and those with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Our intangible assets principally consist of acquired technology, patents, trademarks, customer relationships and contracts, the majority of which are amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives using a range from three to eighteen years.\nWe review long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or a change in circumstances indicate an asset or asset groups carrying value may not be recoverable. Recoverability of an asset or asset group is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the total future undiscounted cash flows that it is expected to generate. If it is determined that an asset or asset group is not recoverable, an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies, trademarks and patents for sound and imaging solutions, and to sell products and services. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over the use of a license, product, or service to a customer.\nFor additional financial information and a summary of our accounting policy, refer to Note 3. \"Revenue Recognition\" to our consolidated financial statements.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of licensing. Cost of licensing primarily consists of amortization expenses associated with purchased intangible assets and intangible assets acquired in business combinations. Cost of licensing also includes IP royalty obligations to third parties, depreciation of our Dolby Cinema equipment provided under operating leases in collaborative arrangements, and direct fees incurred.\nCost of products and services. Cost of products primarily consists of the cost of materials related to products sold, applied labor, and manufacturing overhead. Our cost of products also includes third party royalty obligations paid to license IP that we include in our products. Cost of services primarily consists of the personnel and personnel-related costs of employees performing our professional services, and those of outside consultants, and reimbursable expenses incurred on behalf of customers.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure expenses associated with all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair-value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs\nAdvertising and promotional costs are charged primarily to S&M expense as incurred. Our advertising and promotional costs were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nAdvertising and promotional costs $ 59,821 $ 51,422 $ 52,253\nForeign Currency Activities\nForeign Currency Translation. We maintain business operations in foreign countries. We translate the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries, the majority of which are denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies, into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated using the average rates for the period. Gains and losses from these translations are included in AOCI within stockholders equity.\nForeign Currency Transactions. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency. Therefore, we re-measure non-functional currency assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries using exchange rates at the end of each period. As a result, we recognize foreign currency transaction and re-measurement gains and losses, which are recorded within other income, net in our consolidated statements of operations. These losses were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nForeign currency transaction gains/(losses) $ 536 $ (1,283) $ (749)\nNon-designated Hedges. In an effort to reduce the risk that our earnings will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts exclusively to hedge against assets and liabilities for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure. These derivative instruments are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded to other income/(expense), net, in our consolidated statements of operations. While not designated as hedging instruments, these foreign currency forward contracts are used to reduce the exchange rate risk associated primarily with intercompany receivables and payables. These contracts do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements as gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the related receivables and payables for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of equal to or less than 31 days, respectively, and the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $61.7 million and $56.6 million, respectively. The fair values of these contracts are included within prepaid expenses and other current assets and within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nCash Flow Hedges. We also enter into forward currency contracts exclusively designated as cash flow hedges, which have a maturity of thirteen months or less, to reduce the impact of currency volatility on U.S. dollar operating expenses. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the outstanding derivative instruments had maturities of equal to or less than 12 months, and the total notional amounts of outstanding contracts were $73.1 million and $74.1 million, respectively. The gains and losses from the effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded at fair value as a component of AOCI, until the hedged item is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings, with the corresponding hedged item. Amounts reclassified are recorded to the same line item in the consolidated statements of operations as the impact of the hedge transaction, concurrently with the hedged costs.\nThe pre-tax gain attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was $4.9 million in fiscal 2023. The pre-tax loss attributed to the effective portion of cash flow hedges recognized in AOCI was $2.6 million in fiscal 2022. The pre-tax effective portion of the losses reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations was $0.7 million and $2.1 million in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method, under which deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, and NOL carryforwards are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization of deferred tax assets is additionally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income in making this assessment, and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nWe record an unrecognized tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. We include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued are reversed in the period that such determination is made and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nWe continually assess any ASUs or other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB to determine their applicability and impact on us. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement will result in a change to our financial reporting, we take the appropriate steps to ensure that such changes are properly reflected in our consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.\nAdopted Standards\nBusiness Combinations. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by an acquirer in\naccordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This standard is effective for Dolby beginning September 30, 2023 on a prospective basis, but early adoption is permitted. We early adopted this ASU in conjunction with the acquisition of MPEG LA by Via Corp (as defined below), and with that adoption, we recognized $38.1 million in deferred revenue. Refer to Note 15 \"Business Combinations\" for a description of the recent business combination involving Via LA. There were no other business combinations entered into during fiscal 2023.\n3. Revenue Recognition\nWe enter into revenue arrangements with our customers to license technologies, trademarks and patents for sound and imaging solutions, and to sell products and services. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over the use of a license, product, or service to a customer.\nA. Identification of the Contract or Contracts with Customers\nWe generally determine that a contract with a customer exists upon the execution of an agreement and after consideration of collectability, which could include an evaluation of the customer's payment history, the existence of a standby letter-of-credit between the customers financial institution and our financial institution, public financial information, and other factors. At contract inception, we also evaluate whether two or more non-standard agreements with a customer should be combined and accounted for as a single contract.\nB. Identification of Performance Obligations in a Contract\nWe generate revenue principally from the following sources, which represent performance obligations in our contracts with customers:\nLicensing. We license our technologies, including patents, to a range of customers who incorporate them into their products for enhanced audio and imaging functionality across broadcast, mobile, CE, PC, gaming, and other markets.\nProduct Sales. We design and provide audio and imaging products for the cinema, television, broadcast, and entertainment industries.\nServices. We provide various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment, including equipment training, mixing room alignment, equalization, as well as audio, color and light image calibration. We also offer solutions to companies building real-time digital experiences that increase audience engagement. Our solution provides the capability to stream high quality audiovisual content in ultra-low latency which reduces the delay between the action and the viewer.\nPCS. We provide PCS for products sold and for equipment leased, and we support the implementation of our licensing technologies in our licensees products.\nEquipment Leases. We collaborate with established cinema exhibitors to offer Dolby Cinema, a branded premium cinema offering for movie audiences by leasing equipment and licensing our IP.\nLicensing Administration Fees. We generate administrative fees for managing patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners through our subsidiary, Via LA. See Note 15 \"Business Combinations\" for a description of the recent business combination involving Via LA.\nSome of our revenue arrangements include multiple performance obligations, such as hardware, software, support and maintenance, and extended warranty services. We evaluate whether promised products and services are distinct performance obligations.\nThe majority of our arrangements with multiple performance obligations pertain to our digital cinema server and processor sales that include the following distinct performance obligations to which we allocate portions of the transaction price based on their stand-alone selling price:\nDigital cinema server hardware and embedded software, which is dependent on and interrelated with the hardware. Accordingly, the hardware and embedded software represent a single performance obligation.\nThe right to support and maintenance, which is included with the purchase of the digital cinema server hardware, is a distinct performance obligation.\nThe right to receive commissioning services is a distinct performance obligation within the sale of the Dolby Atmos Cinema Processor. These services consist of the review of venue designs specifying proposed speaker placement as well as calibration services performed for installed speakers to ensure optimal playback.\nC. Determination of Transaction Price for Performance Obligations in a Contract\nAfter identifying the distinct performance obligations, we determine the transaction price in accordance with the terms of the underlying executed contract which may include variable consideration such as discounts, rebates, refunds, rights of returns, and incentives. We assess and update, if necessary, the amount of variable consideration to which we are entitled for each reporting period. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate and accrue a liability for returns and adjustments as a reduction to revenue based on several factors, including past returns history.\nWith the exception of our sales-based royalties, we evaluate whether a significant financing component exists when we recognize revenue in advance of customer payments that occur over time. For example, some of our licensing arrangements include payment terms greater than one year from when we transfer control of our IP to a licensee and the receipt of the final payment for that IP. If a significant financing component exists, we classify a portion of the transaction price as interest income, instead of recognizing all of the transaction price as revenue. We do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of financing if, at contract inception, the period between the transfer of control to a customer and final payment is expected to be one year or less.\nD. Allocation of Transaction Price to Distinct Performance Obligations in a Contract\nFor our sales-based royalties where the license is the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we present all revenue as licensing.\nFor revenue arrangements that include multiple performance obligations, we determine the stand-alone selling price for each distinct performance obligation based on the actual selling prices made to customers. If the performance obligation is not sold separately, we estimate the stand-alone selling price. We do so by considering market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies, customer specific information and industry technology lifecycles, internal conditions such as cost and pricing practices, or applying the residual approach method when the selling price of the good, most commonly a license, is highly variable or uncertain.\nOnce the transaction price, including any variable consideration, has been determined, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations identified in the contract and recognize revenue as or when control is transferred for each distinct performance obligation.\nE. Revenue Recognition as Control is Transferred to a Customer\nWe generate our licensing revenue by licensing our technologies and patents to various types of licensees, such as chip manufacturers (\"implementation licensees\"), consumer product manufacturers, software vendors, and communications service providers. Our revenue recognition policies for each of these arrangements are summarized below.\nInitial fees from implementation licensees. Implementation licensees incorporate our technologies into their chipsets that, once approved by Dolby, are available for purchase by OEMs for use in end-user products. Implementation licensees only pay us a nominal initial fee on contract execution as consideration for the ongoing services that we provide to assist in their implementation process. Revenue from these initial fees is recognized ratably over the contractual term as a component of licensing revenue.\nSales-based licensing fees. In our royalty bearing licensing agreements with OEMs, control is transferred upon the later of contract execution or the contracts effective date. We apply the royalty exception, which requires that we recognize sales-based royalties when the sales occur based on our estimates. These estimates involve the use of historical data and judgment for several key attributes including industry estimates of expected shipments, the percentage of markets using our technologies, and average sale prices. Generally, our estimates represent the current periods shipments to which we expect our licensees to submit royalty statements within the following two quarters. Upon receipt of royalty statements from the licensees with the actual reporting of sales-based royalties that we estimated previously, we record a favorable or unfavorable adjustment based on the difference, if any, between estimated and actual sales. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a favorable adjustment of approximately $10 million, which was primarily related to shipments that occurred in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (July through September) and largely based on actual royalty statements received from licensees. In the second quarter of fiscal\n2023, we recorded a favorable adjustment of $1 million, and in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we recorded a favorable adjustment of $1 million and $5 million, respectively, each primarily related to shipments that occurred in the prior two quarters, and largely based on actual royalty statements received from licensees.\nFixed and guaranteed licensing fees. In certain cases, our arrangements require the licensee to pay fixed, non-refundable fees. In these cases, control is transferred and fees are recognized upon the later of contract execution or the effective date. Additionally and separate from initial fees from implementation licensees, our sales- and usage-based licensing agreements include a nominal fee, which is also recognized at a point in time in which control of the IP has been transferred. Revenue from these arrangements is included as a component of licensing revenue.\nRecoveries. Through compliance efforts, we identify misreported licensed activity related to non-current periods. We may record a favorable or unfavorable revenue adjustment in connection with the findings from these compliance efforts generally upon resolution with the licensee through agreement of the findings, or upon receipt of the licensees correction statement. Revenue from these arrangements is included as a component of licensing revenue.\nWe undertake activities aimed at identifying potential unauthorized uses of our technologies, which, when successful, result in the recognition of revenue. Recoveries stem from third parties who agree to remit payments to us based on past use of our technology. In these scenarios, a legally binding contract did not exist at the time of use of our technology, and therefore, we recognize revenue recoveries upon execution of the agreement as that is the point in time at which a contract exists and control is transferred. This revenue is classified as licensing revenue.\nIn general, we classify legal costs associated with activities aimed at identifying potential unauthorized uses of our technologies, auditing existing licensees, and on occasion, pursuing litigation as S&M in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe recognize licensing revenue gross of withholding taxes, which our licensees remit directly to their local tax authorities, and for which we receive a partial foreign tax credit in our income tax provision.\nIn addition to our licensing arrangements, we also enter into arrangements to deliver products and services.\nProduct Sales. Revenue from the sale of products is recognized when the customer obtains control of the promised good or service, which is generally upon shipment. Payments are generally made within 90 days of sale.\nServices. We provide various services, such as engineering services related to movie soundtrack print mastering, equipment training and maintenance, mixing room alignment, equalization, and image calibration, which we bill on a fixed fee and time and materials basis. Most of these services are of a short duration and are recognized as control of the performance obligations are transferred which is when the related services are performed.\nCloud Services. We provide access to audio and video APIs through our developer platform as well as cloud encoding services, generally, on either a consumption or subscription basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis is recognized when the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenue related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\nCollaborative Arrangements. We collaborate with established cinema exhibitors to offer Dolby Cinema, a branded premium cinema offering for movie audiences. Under such collaborations, Dolby and the exhibitor are both active participants, and share the risks and rewards associated with the business. Accordingly, these collaborations are governed by revenue sharing arrangements under which Dolby receives revenue based on box office receipts, reported to Dolby by exhibitor partners on a monthly or quarterly basis, our proprietary designs and trademarks as well as for the use of our equipment at the exhibitor's venue. The use of our product solution meets the definition of a lease, and for the related portion of Dolby's share of revenue, we apply ASC 842, Leases, and recognize revenue based on monthly box office reports from exhibitors. Our revenue share is recognized as licensing revenue in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, we also enter into hybrid agreements where a portion of our revenue share involves guaranteed payments, which in some cases result in classifying the arrangement as a sales-type lease. In such arrangements, we consider control to transfer at the point in time to which we have installed and tested the equipment, at which point we record such guaranteed payments as product revenue.\nLicensing Administration Fee. We generate administrative fees for managing patent pools on behalf of third party patent owners through our subsidiary, Via LA. As an agent to licensors in the patent pool, Via LA receives a share of the sales-based royalty that the patent pool licensors earn from licensees. As such, we apply the sales-based royalty exception as the service provided is directly related to the patent pool licensors provision of IP, which results in recognition based on estimates of the licensees quarter shipments that use the pools patents. In addition to sales-based royalties, Via LA also has contracts where the fees are fixed. The revenue share Via LA receives from licensors on fixed fee contracts is recognized over the term in which we are providing services associated with the fixed fee contract. We recognize our administrative fees net of the consideration paid to the patent licensors in the pool as licensing revenue. See Note 15 \"Business Combinations\" to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the recent business combination involving Via LA.\nDeferred revenue, which is a component of contract liabilities, represents amounts that are ultimately expected to be recognized as revenue, but for which we have yet to satisfy the performance obligation. On September 29, 2023, we had $71.3 million of remaining performance obligations, 44% of which we expect to recognize as revenue in fiscal 2024, 21% in fiscal 2025, and the balance of 35% in fiscal years beyond 2025.\nF. Disaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents a summary of the composition of our revenue for all periods presented (in thousands, except percentage amounts):\nFiscal Year Ended\nRevenue September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 24, 2021\nLicensing $ 1,197,930 92 % $ 1,164,533 93 % $ 1,214,147 95 %\nProducts and services 101,814 8 % 89,260 7 % 67,109 5 %\nTotal revenue $ 1,299,744 100 % $ 1,253,793 100 % $ 1,281,256 100 %\nThe following table presents the composition of our licensing revenue for all periods presented (in thousands, except percentage amounts):\nFiscal Year Ended\nMarket September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 24, 2021\nBroadcast $ 451,719 38 % $ 433,992 37 % $ 475,648 39 %\nMobile 243,897 20 % 238,735 21 % 261,232 22 %\nCE 170,197 14 % 186,285 16 % 181,944 15 %\nPC 124,362 10 % 151,079 13 % 141,919 12 %\nOther 207,755 18 % 154,442 13 % 153,404 12 %\nTotal licensing revenue $ 1,197,930 100 % $ 1,164,533 100 % $ 1,214,147 100 %\nWe license our technologies in approximately 70 countries, and our licensees distribute products that incorporate our technologies throughout the world. We generate the majority of our revenue from outside the U.S. Geographic data for our licensing revenue is based on the location of our licensees headquarters, products revenue is based on the destination to which we ship our products, and services revenue is based on the location where services are performed. The following table presents the composition of our revenue by geographic location for all periods presented (in thousands, except percentage amounts):\nFiscal Year Ended\nGeographic Location September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 September 24, 2021\nUnited States $ 466,030 36 % $ 468,246 37 % $ 419,901 33 %\nInternational 833,714 64 % 785,547 63 % 861,355 67 %\nTotal revenue $ 1,299,744 100 % $ 1,253,793 100 % $ 1,281,256 100 %\nG. Contract Balances\nOur contract assets represent rights to consideration from licensees for the use of our IP that we have estimated in a given period in the absence of receiving actual royalty statements from licensees. These estimates reflect our best judgment at that time, and are developed using a number of inputs, including historical data, industry estimates of expected shipments, anticipated sales price and performance, and third party data supporting the percentage of markets using our technologies. In the event that our estimates differ from actual amounts reported, we record an adjustment in the quarter in which the royalty statement is received, which is typically the quarter following our estimate. Actual amounts reported are typically paid within 60 days following the end of the quarter of shipment. The main drivers for change in the contract assets account are variances in quarterly estimates, and to a lesser degree,\ntiming of receipt of actual royalty statements.\nOur contract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in advance of performance and deferred revenue that is typically satisfied within one year. The non-current portion of contract liabilities is separately disclosed in our consolidated balance sheets. We present the net contract asset or liability when we have both contract assets and contract liabilities for a single contract. In fiscal 2023, we recognized $18.3 million from prior period deferred revenue.\nThe following table presents a summary of the balances to which contract assets and liabilities related to revenue are recorded for all periods presented (in thousands, except percentage amounts):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 Change ($) Change (%)\nAccounts receivable, net $ 262,245 $ 243,593 $ 18,652 8 %\nContract assets, net 182,130 176,093 6,037 3 %\nContract liabilities - current 31,505 18,588 12,917 69 %\nContract liabilities - non-current 39,997 23,203 16,794 72 %\n4. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions\nThe following tables present detailed information from our consolidated balance sheets as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands).\nAccounts Receivable and Contract Assets\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nTrade accounts receivable $ 137,820 $ 162,531\nAccounts receivable from patent administration program licensees 134,108 92,896\nContract assets 182,268 176,218\nAccounts receivable and contract assets, gross 454,196 431,645\nLess: allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable and contract assets (9,821) (11,959)\nTotal accounts receivable and contract assets, net $ 444,375 $ 419,686\nAccounts receivable as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, includes unbilled accounts receivable balances of $150.4 million and $106.9 million, related to amounts that are contractually owed. The unbilled balance represents our unconditional right to consideration related to fixed fee contracts which we are entitled to as a result of satisfying, or partially satisfying, performance obligations, as well as Via LA's unconditional right to consideration related to its patent administration programs.\nAllowance for Credit Losses Beginning Balance Charges/(Credits)\nto S&M and G&A Additions/(Deductions) Ending Balance\nFor fiscal year ended:\nSeptember 24, 2021 $ 15,908 $ (2,889) $ (4,067) $ 8,952\nSeptember 30, 2022 8,952 5,460 (7) 14,405\nSeptember 29, 2023 14,405 (793) (2,643) 10,969\nAllowance for credit losses includes the provision for estimated credit losses on our sales-type leases, which was not material as of September 29, 2023 and as of September 30, 2022.\nInventories\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nRaw materials $ 6,203 $ 10,026\nWork in process 3,972 4,955\nFinished goods 25,448 8,568\nTotal inventories $ 35,623 $ 23,549\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventory with a consumption period expected to exceed twelve months is recorded within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. We have included $8.1 million and $2.8 million of inventory within non-current assets as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Based on anticipated inventory consumption rates, and aside from existing write-downs due to excess inventory, we do not believe that material risk of obsolescence exists prior to ultimate sale.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nPrepaid expenses $ 24,435 $ 26,851\nOther current assets 26,257 23,224\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 50,692 $ 50,075\nAccrued Liabilities\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nAmounts payable to patent administration program partners $ 150,509 $ 63,106\nAccrued compensation and benefits 118,728 84,111\nAccrued professional fees 18,632 13,057\nUnpaid property, plant, and equipment additions 18,002 15,428\nAccrued customer refunds 3,878 3,674\nAccrued market development funds 5,010 7,206\nOther accrued liabilities 36,640 43,655\nTotal accrued liabilities $ 351,399 $ 230,237\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nSupplemental retirement plan obligations $ 4,302 $ 4,127\nNon-current tax liabilities (1)\n74,482 83,758\nOther liabilities 29,555 12,237\nTotal other non-current liabilities $ 108,339 $ 100,122\n(1) Refer to Note 12 \"Income Taxes\" for additional information related to our tax liabilities.\n5. Investments and Fair Value Measurements\nWe use cash holdings to purchase investment-grade securities diversified among security types, industries, and issuers. All of our investments in debt securities are measured at fair value, and are recorded within cash equivalents and both short-term and long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. With the exception of our mutual fund investments held in our SERP and classified as trading securities and our other long-term investments, all of our investments are classified as AFS securities. Derivative contracts are used to hedge currency risk, and these are carried at fair value and classified as other assets and other liabilities.\nOur investments in debt securities consist of corporate bonds, government bonds, municipal debt securities, U.S. agency securities, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit.

Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We minimize the use of unobservable inputs and use observable market data, if available, when determining fair value. We classify our inputs to measure fair value using the following three-level hierarchy:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. We base the fair value of our Level 1 financial instruments, which are traded in active markets, using quoted market prices for identical instruments.\nLevel 2: Prices may be based upon quoted prices in active markets or inputs not quoted on active markets but are corroborated by market data. We obtain the fair value of our Level 2 financial instruments from a professional pricing service, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments, or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market data. To validate the fair value determination provided by our primary pricing service, we perform quality controls over values received which include comparing our pricing service providers assessment of the fair values of our investment securities against the fair values of our investment securities obtained from another independent source, reviewing the pricing movement in the context of overall market trends, and reviewing trading information from our investment managers. In addition, we\nassess the inputs and methods used in determining the fair value in order to determine the classification of securities in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the currency derivatives are calculated from market spot rates, forward rates, interest rates, and credit ratings at the end of the period.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available and reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe following table describes the valuation techniques and inputs applicable to each class of security held within our investment portfolio as of September 29, 2023:\nAsset Type Primary Source Update Frequency Fair Value Methodology Secondary Source\nLevel 1\nMoney Market Funds Not Applicable Daily $1 per share Not Applicable\nU.S. Government Bonds ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Daily Institutional Bond Quotes - evaluations based on various market and industry inputs Bloomberg\nLevel 2\nCertificates of Deposit ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Daily Institutional Bond Quotes - evaluations based on various market and industry inputs Bloomberg\nCommercial Paper U.S. Bank Pricing Unit Daily Matrix Pricing Not Applicable\nCorporate Bonds ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Daily Institutional Bond Quotes - evaluations based on various market and industry inputs Bloomberg\nMunicipal Debt Securities ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Daily Evaluations based on various market and industry inputs Bloomberg\nU.S. Agency Securities ICE (Intercontinental Exchange) Daily Institutional Bond Quotes - evaluations based on various market and industry inputs Bloomberg\nInt'l Government Bonds ICE (Intercontinental Exchange)\nExtel Financial Ltd Daily Evaluations based on various market factors Bloomberg\nSecurities In Gross Unrealized Loss Position. We periodically evaluate our investments for impairment by comparing the fair value with the cost basis for each of our investment securities. The unrealized losses on our AFS securities were primarily the result of unfavorable changes in interest rates subsequent to the initial purchase of these securities. The following table presents the gross unrealized losses and fair value for those AFS securities that were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and for greater than twelve months as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nLess Than 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months Less Than 12 Months Greater Than 12 Months\nInvestment Type Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses Fair Value Gross Unrealized Losses\nCertificate of deposit $ - $ - $ - $ - $ 10,352 $ (47) $ - $ -\nU.S. agency securities 853 (7) - - 13,144 (5) 1,395 (55)\nGovernment bonds 26,756 (247) 40,235 (1,183) 89,741 (2,593) 8,566 (332)\nCommercial paper 5,840 (3) - - 5,770 (15) - -\nCorporate bonds 79,846 (461) 14,634 (558) 81,044 (1,523) 18,306 (561)\nMunicipal debt securities 23,365 (203) 8,166 (206) 40,119 (712) 3,336 (156)\nTotal $ 136,660 $ (921) $ 63,035 $ (1,947) $ 240,170 $ (4,895) $ 31,603 $ (1,104)\nAlthough we had certain securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, we expect to recover the full carrying value of these securities.\nInvestment Maturities. The following table summarizes the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the AFS securities within our investment portfolio based on stated maturities as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, which are recorded within cash equivalents and both short and long-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nRange of maturity Amortized Cost Fair Value Amortized Cost Fair Value\nDue within 1 year $ 283,229 $ 282,225 $ 336,291 $ 334,537\nDue in 1 to 2 years 67,679 66,075 53,721 51,332\nDue in 2 to 5 years 20,743 20,493 42,122 40,280\nTotal $ 371,651 $ 368,793 $ 432,134 $ 426,149\n6.

Depreciation expense was $54.0 million, $59.5 million, and $66.4 million in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nAs of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, PP&E consisted of the following (in thousands):\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment September 29,\n2023 September 30,\nLand $ 41,902 $ 41,774\nBuildings and building improvements 287,799 287,544\nLeasehold improvements 79,988 86,793\nMachinery and equipment 152,675 136,995\nComputer equipment and software 233,224 232,108\nFurniture and fixtures 32,629 33,797\nEquipment provided under operating leases 211,910 229,177\nConstruction-in-progress 18,327 23,037\nProperty, plant, and equipment, gross 1,058,454 1,071,225\nLess: accumulated depreciation (576,873) (557,744)\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 481,581 $ 513,481\n7. Leases\nAs Lessee\nAs a lessee, we enter into contracts to access and utilize office space, including those payable to our principal stockholder and portions attributable to the noncontrolling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries. We determine if a contract contains a lease based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized as the lease liability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the future lease payments at the lease commencement date. The interest rate used to determine the present value of the future lease payments is our IBR, because the interest rate implicit in our leases is not readily determinable. The IBR is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be and resulting interest we would pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment over the lease term on a collateralized basis. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments are included in our lease liability calculation. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nThe lease term of operating leases vary from less than a year to 10 years. We have leases that include one or more options to extend the lease term for up to 5 years as well as options to terminate the lease within one year. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such options.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nLease cost\nOperating lease cost $ 14,860 $ 17,260 $ 19,261\nVariable lease cost 1,424 1,560 755\nTotal lease cost $ 16,284 $ 18,820 $ 20,016\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nOther information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities $ 16,589 $ 16,957 $ 19,173\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations 16,259 1,737 5,225\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nOperating Leases\nWeighted-average remaining lease term 5.3 years 5.5 years\nWeighted-average discount rate 4.6 % 3.2 %\nThe following table presents the maturity analysis of lease liabilities (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023\nOperating Leases\nFiscal 2024 $ 17,547\nFiscal 2025 12,700\nFiscal 2026 7,413\nFiscal 2027 5,912\nFiscal 2028 5,669\nThereafter 11,020\nTotal undiscounted lease payments 60,261\nLess: imputed interest (9,613)\nTotal lease liabilities $ 50,648\nAs Lessor\nAs a lessor, we lease our Dolby Cinema product solution to exhibitors. The terms of these leases are typically 10 years. Lease components consist of fixed payments and/or variable lease payments based on contracted percentages of revenue. Generally, leases do not grant any right to the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term. Dolby Cinema lease arrangements have options to extend the lease term at expiration by increments ranging from 1 to 5 years.\nAssets provided under an operating lease are carried at cost within property, plant, and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets, and depreciated over the useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. Fixed operating lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term to revenue. Variable lease payments received under our Dolby Cinema operating leases are computed as shares of lessees' box office revenue and recognized to revenue in the period that box office sales occur. Lease incentive payments we make to lessees are amortized as a reduction in revenue over the lease term. The components of lease income were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nOperating Lease Income\nVariable operating lease income $ 33,921 $ 31,514 $ 9,511\nFixed operating lease income $ 3,253 $ 2,953 $ 4,203\nIf a lease is classified as a sales-type lease, the carrying amount of the asset is derecognized from property, plant, and equipment, net, and a net investment in the lease is recorded. The net investment in the lease is measured at commencement date as the sum of the lease receivable and the estimated residual value of the equipment. The unguaranteed residual value of the equipment is determined as the estimated carrying value of the asset at the end of the lease term had the asset been depreciated on a straight-line basis. The unguaranteed residual value of sales-type leases was $1.0 million and $1.1 million as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. Selling profit or loss arising from a sales-type lease is recorded at lease commencement and presented on a gross basis. We recognized $2.3 million to revenue and $0.4 million to cost of revenue associated with sales-type leases in fiscal 2023. Over the term of the lease, we recognize interest income on the net investment in the lease, and variable lease payments, which are not included in the net investment in the lease. The variable lease payments are not material.\nThe following table presents the maturity analysis of fixed lease payments due to Dolby (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023\nOperating Leases Sales-Type Leases\nFiscal 2024 $ 1,090 $ 795\nFiscal 2025 1,109 795\nFiscal 2026 932 395\nTotal undiscounted cash flows $ 3,131 1,985\nLess: Carrying value of lease receivables (563)\nDifference $ 1,422\n8.

(\"Millicast\"), respectively. Refer to Note 15 \"Business Combinations\" for additional information. During fiscal 2022, we purchased various patents for purchase consideration of $11.5 million, and upon acquisition, these intangible assets had a weighted-average useful life of 16 years. These intangible assets facilitate our R&D efforts, technologies, and potential product offerings.\nAmortization expense for our intangible assets is included in cost of licensing, cost of products and services, R&D, S&M, and G&A expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. Amortization expense was $28.6 million, $29.0 million, and $29.5 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of September 29, 2023, expected amortization expense of our intangible assets in future fiscal periods was as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Amortization Expense\n2024 $ 30,130\n2025 15,812\n2026 15,293\n2027 14,773\n2028 14,614\nThereafter 76,805\nTotal $ 167,427\n9. Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based awards as a form of compensation for employees, officers, and directors. We issue stock-based awards in the form of stock options and RSUs under our equity incentive plans, as well as shares under our ESPP.\nCommon Stock - Class A and Class B\nOur Board of Directors has authorized two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B. As of September 29, 2023, we had authorized 500,000,000 Class A shares and 500,000,000 Class B shares. As of September 29, 2023, we had 59,673,633 shares of Class A common stock and 36,085,779 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. Holders of our Class A and Class B common stock have identical rights, except that holders of our Class A common stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of our Class B common stock are entitled to ten votes per share. Shares of Class B common stock can be converted to shares of Class A common stock at any time at the option of the stockholder and automatically convert upon sale or transfer, except for certain transfers specified in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nStock Incentive Plans\nOur 2020 Stock Plan originally was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders in 2005 (when the 2020 Stock Plan was called the 2005 Stock Plan). Our stockholders last approved amendments to the 2020 Stock Plan at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. Our 2020 Stock Plan, as amended and restated, provides for the ability to grant incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock units, performance units, performance bonus awards, and performance shares. A total of 64.0 million shares of our Class A common stock have been authorized for issuance under the 2020 Stock Plan since inception of the plan. Any shares subject to an award with a per share price less than the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant and any shares subject to an outstanding RSU award will be counted against the authorized share reserve as 1.6 shares for every one share subject to the award, and if returned to the 2020 Stock Plan, such shares will be counted as 1.6 shares for every one share returned.\nStock Options. Stock options are granted at fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest over four years, with 25% of the options becoming exercisable on the one-year anniversary of the date of grant and the balance of the shares vesting in equal monthly installments over the following 36 months. These options expire on the earlier of ten years after the date of grant or three months after termination of service. All options granted vest over the requisite service period and upon the exercise of stock options, we issue new shares of Class A common stock under the 2020 Stock Plan. Our 2020 Stock Plan also allows us to grant stock awards which vest based on the satisfaction of specific performance criteria.\nPerformance-Based Stock Options. From fiscal 2016 through fiscal 2019, we granted PSOs to certain officers with shares of our Class A common stock underlying such options. The contractual term for the PSOs was seven years, with vesting contingent upon market-based performance conditions, representing the achievement of specified\nDolby annualized TSR targets at the end of a three-year measurement period following the date of grant. Anywhere from 0% to 125% of the shares subject to a PSO vested based on achievement of the performance conditions at the end of the three-year performance period.\nIn valuing the PSOs, which will be recognized as compensation cost, we used a Monte Carlo valuation model. Aside from the use of an expected term for the PSOs commensurate with their shorter contractual term, the nature of the valuation inputs used in the Monte Carlo valuation model were consistent with those used to value our non-performance based options granted under the 2020 Stock Plan. Compensation cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe following table summarizes information about PSOs granted to our officers that have vested during the periods presented:\nGrant Date Aggregate Shares Granted at Target Award Aggregate Shares Exercisable at Vest Date (1)\nPercentage Vested of Target Award Vested Date\nDecember 15, 2018 241,100 158,700 75 % December 2021\n(1)Aggregate shares exercisable at vest date does not include any shares that were cancelled before the vest date after they were granted.\nAs of September 29, 2023, an aggregate of 249,228 shares of PSOs were exercisable and outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock options, including PSOs, issued under our 2020 Stock Plan:\nShares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Life Aggregate Intrinsic\nValue (1)\n(in thousands) (in years) (in thousands)\nOptions outstanding as of September 30, 2022 4,059 $ 62.59\nGrants 326 71.07\nExercises (657) 47.26\nForfeitures and cancellations (8) 53.19\nOptions outstanding as of September 29, 2023 3,720 66.13 5.25 $ 55,930\nOptions vested and expected to vest as of September 29, 2023 3,587 65.97 5.19 55,579\nOptions exercisable as of September 29, 2023 2,938 62.95 4.49 52,361\n(1)Aggregate intrinsic value is based on the closing stock price of our Class A common stock on September 29, 2023 of $79.26 and excludes the impact of options that were not in-the-money.\nRestricted Stock Units. In fiscal 2008, we began granting RSUs to certain directors, officers and employees. RSU awards granted to employees and officers generally vest over four years, with cliff-vesting. Awards granted to ongoing non-employee directors generally vest over approximately one year. Awards granted to new non-employee directors from fiscal 2014 onward vest on the earlier of the first anniversary of the awards date of grant, or the day immediately preceding the date of the next annual meeting of stockholders that occurs after the awards date of grant. At each vesting date, the holder of the award is issued shares of our Class A common stock. Compensation expense from these awards is equal to the adjusted fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant, discounted to account for dividend payments forgone during the vesting period, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Certain grants may have other vesting conditions or other award terms as approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors. Our 2020 Stock Plan also allows us to grant RSUs that vest based on the satisfaction of specific performance criteria.\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units. In fiscal 2020, we began granting PSUs to certain officers with shares of our Class A common stock underlying such awards. The terms of the PSU Agreement adopted in the first quarter fiscal 2020 provide for the grant of PSUs to certain officers contingent on Dolby's achievement of annualized TSR targets measured against a comparator index over a three-year performance period following the date of grant. Anywhere from 0% to 200% of eligible restricted stock units may vest based on achievement of the performance conditions at the end of the three-year performance period. The value of the PSUs, which is recognized as compensation cost, is calculated using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Certain grants may have other vesting conditions or other award terms as approved by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\nThe following table summarizes information on PSUs granted to our officers that have not vested as of September 29, 2023:\nAggregate Shares Granted Potential Shares at Vest Date (at 200% of Target\nDecember 15, 2020 66,138 132,276\nDecember 15, 2021 60,301 120,602\nDecember 15, 2022 90,613 181,226\nOn December 16, 2019, we granted PSUs vesting for an aggregate of 62,000 shares at the target award amount, which vested at 81% of the target award amount. As of September 29, 2023, PSUs which would vest for an aggregate of 204,709 shares at the target award amount (409,418 shares at 200% of the target award amount) were outstanding.\nThe following table summarizes information about RSUs, including PSUs, issued under our 2020 Stock Plan:\nShares Weighted-Average\nGrant Date Fair Value\n(in thousands)\nNon-vested as of September 30, 2022 3,502 $ 83.09\nGranted 1,718 69.74\nVested (1,252) 78.74\nForfeitures (221) 79.62\nNon-vested as of September 29, 2023 3,747 $ 78.62\nThe fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nRestricted stock units - vest date fair value $ 92,843 $ 106,919 $ 101,108\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan. Our ESPP originally was adopted by our Board of Directors and shareholders in 2005. Our stockholders last approved amendments to the ESPP at our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders. The ESPP allows eligible employees to have up to 10 percent of their eligible compensation withheld and used to purchase Class A common stock, subject to a maximum of $25,000 worth of stock purchased in a calendar year or no more than 1,000 shares in an offering period, whichever is less. An offering period consists of successive six-month purchase periods, with a look back feature to our stock price at the commencement of a one-year offering period. The plan provides for a discount equal to 15 percent of the lower of the closing price of our Class A common stock on the NYSE on the first day of the offering period and the last day of the purchase period. The plan also includes an automatic reset feature that provides for an offering period to be reset and recommenced to a new lower-priced offering if the offering price of a new offering period is less than that of the immediately preceding offering period. A total of 5.5 million shares of our Class A common stock have been authorized for issuance under the ESPP since inception of the plan.\nStock Option Valuation Assumptions\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the estimated fair value of employee stock options at the date of the grant. The Black-Scholes model includes inputs that require us to make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the expected term of the award, as well as the future risk-free interest rate, and the volatility of our stock price over the expected term of the award.\nExpected Term. The expected term of an award represents the estimated period of time that options granted will remain outstanding, and is measured from the grant date to the date at which the option is either exercised or canceled. Our determination of the expected term involves an evaluation of historical terms and other factors such as the exercise and termination patterns of our employees who hold options to acquire our Class A common stock, and is based on certain assumptions made regarding the future exercise and termination behavior.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury instruments in effect on the date of grant. In determining an estimate for the risk-free interest rate, we use average interest rates based on these instruments constant maturities with a term that approximates and corresponds with the expected term of our awards.\nExpected Stock Price Volatility. The expected volatility represents the estimated volatility in the price of our Class A common stock over a time period that approximates the expected term of the awards. The expected volatility has historically been determined using a blended combination of historical and implied volatility, but is currently being determined using historical volatility only. Historical volatility is representative of the historical trends in our stock price for periods preceding the measurement date for a period that is commensurate with the expected term. Implied volatility is based upon externally traded option contracts of our Class A common stock.\nDividend Yield. The dividend yield is based on our anticipated dividend payout over the expected term of our option awards. Dividend declarations and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the Board of Directors continuing determination that the dividend policy is in the best interests of our stockholders. The dividend policy may be changed or canceled at the discretion of the Board of Directors at any time.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of our stock options were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nExpected term (in years) 4.82 4.78 4.88\nRisk-free interest rate 3.6 % 1.5 % 0.8 %\nExpected stock price volatility 29.4 % 28.8 % 27.9 %\nDividend yield 1.6 % 1.1 % 1.0 %\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average fair value (per share) of stock options granted and the total intrinsic value of stock options exercised (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nStock options granted - weighted-average grant date fair value $ 19.15 $ 21.17 $ 20.93\nStock options exercised - intrinsic value 22,736 22,885 102,812\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation expense for equity awards granted to employees is determined by estimating their fair value on the date of grant, and recognizing that value as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period in which our employees earn the awards. Compensation expense related to these equity awards is recognized net of estimated forfeitures, which reduce the expense recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. The selection of applicable estimated forfeiture rates is based on an evaluation of trends in our historical forfeiture data with consideration for other potential driving factors. If in subsequent periods actual forfeitures significantly differ from our initial estimates, we will revise such estimates accordingly. The estimated annual forfeiture rates used for awards granted were 8.62%, 8.63%, and 8.85% in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nThe following two tables separately present stock-based compensation expense both by award type and classification in our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nExpense - By Award Type\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nCompensation expense\nStock options $ 8,486 $ 10,244 $ 13,724\nRestricted stock units (1) (2)\n105,915 98,433 80,705\nEmployee stock purchase plan 4,085 6,248 5,269\nTotal stock-based compensation 118,486 114,925 99,698\nEstimated benefit from income taxes (17,844) (17,581) (15,790)\nTotal stock-based compensation, net of tax $ 100,642 $ 97,344 $ 83,908\n(1)Stock-based compensation expense incurred by restricted stock units includes expense from PSUs.\n(2)Excludes $1.2 million and $0.7 million of capitalized stock-based compensation related to internal use software in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\nExpense - By Income Statement Line Item Classification\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nCompensation expense\nCost of products and services $ 1,697 $ 1,819 $ 2,033\nResearch and development 39,472 37,061 29,733\nSales and marketing 40,038 41,326 36,432\nGeneral and administrative 37,279 34,719 31,500\nTotal stock-based compensation 118,486 114,925 99,698\nEstimated benefit from income taxes (17,844) (17,581) (15,790)\nTotal stock-based compensation, net of tax $ 100,642 $ 97,344 $ 83,908\nThe tax benefit that we recognize from shares issued under our ESPP is excluded from the tables above. The tax benefit recognized was not material in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, and was $1.2 million in fiscal 2021.\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense. As of September 29, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense associated with employee stock options expected to vest was approximately $11.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. As of September 29, 2023, total unrecognized compensation expense associated with RSUs expected to vest was approximately $188.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.3 years.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nIn November 2009, we announced a stock repurchase program, providing for the repurchase of our Class A common stock. The following table summarizes the initial amount of authorized repurchases as well as additional repurchases approved by our Board of Directors as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands):\nDate of Authorization Authorization Amount\nFiscal 2010: November 2009 $ 250,000\nFiscal 2010: July 2010 300,000\nFiscal 2011: July 2011 250,000\nFiscal 2012: February 2012 100,000\nFiscal 2015: October 2014 200,000\nFiscal 2017: January 2017 200,000\nFiscal 2018: July 2018 350,000\nFiscal 2019: July 2019 350,000\nFiscal 2021: July 2021 350,000\nFiscal 2022: February 2022 250,000\nFiscal 2022: August 2022 350,000\nTotal $ 2,950,000\nStock repurchases under the program may be made through open market transactions, negotiated purchases, or otherwise, at times and in amounts that we consider appropriate. The timing of repurchases and the number of shares repurchased depend upon a variety of factors, including price, regulatory requirements, the rate of dilution from our equity compensation plans, and other market conditions. The program does not have a specified expiration date, and can be limited, suspended, or terminated at our discretion at any time without prior notice. Shares repurchased under the program will be returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of Class A common stock. As of September 29, 2023, the remaining authorization to purchase additional shares was $211.6 million.\nThe following table provides information regarding share repurchase activity under the program during fiscal 2023:\nQuarterly Repurchase Activity Shares\nRepurchased Cost (1)\nAverage Price Paid Per Share (2)\n(in thousands)\nQ1 - Quarter ended December 30, 2022 680,861 $ 49,412 $ 72.57\nQ2 - Quarter ended March 31, 2023 631,046 49,864 79.02\nQ3 - Quarter ended June 30, 2023 294,793 25,000 84.81\nQ4 - Quarter ended September 29, 2023 285,499 25,000 87.57\nTotal 1,892,199 $ 149,276\n(1)Cost of share repurchases includes the price paid per share, and excludes commission costs.\n(2)Average price paid per share excludes commission costs.\nDividend Program\nThe following table summarizes dividends declared under the program during fiscal 2023:\nFiscal Period Announcement Date Record Date Payment Date Cash Dividend Per Common Share Dividend Payment\nQ1 - Quarter ended December 30, 2022 February 2, 2023 February 14, 2023 February 22, 2023 $ 0.27 $25.9 million\nQ2 - Quarter ended March 31, 2023 May 4, 2023 May 16, 2023 May 23, 2023 $ 0.27 $25.8 million\nQ3 - Quarter ended June 30, 2023 August 3, 2023 August 14, 2023 August 22, 2023 $ 0.27 $25.8 million\nQ4 - Quarter ended September 29, 2023 November 16, 2023 November 28, 2023 December 5, 2023 $ 0.30 $28.7 million (1)\n(1)The dividend payment amount for the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is estimated based on the number of shares of our Class A and Class B common stock that we estimate will be outstanding as of the Record Date.\n10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nOther comprehensive income/loss consists of three components: unrealized gains or losses on our AFS marketable investment securities, gains and losses on derivatives in cash flow hedge relationships not yet recognized in earnings, and the gains and losses from the translation of assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Until realized and reported as a component of net income, these comprehensive income items accumulate and are included within accumulated other comprehensive loss, a subsection within stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses on our investment securities are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when realized upon sale, and are determined based on specific identification of securities sold. Unrealized gains and losses on our cash flow hedges are reclassified from AOCI into earnings when the hedged operating expenses are recognized, which is also when the gains and losses are realized.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances during the period, and includes information regarding the manner in which the reclassifications out of AOCI into earnings affect our consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended Fiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nInvestment Securities Cash Flow Hedges Currency Translation Adjustments Total Investment Securities Cash Flow Hedges Currency Translation Adjustments Total\nBeginning Balance $ (5,986) $ (4,483) $ (41,172) $ (51,641) $ 220 $ (122) $ (10,128) $ (10,030)\nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications:\nUnrealized gains/(losses) 3,313 4,869 - 8,182 (6,783) (2,588) - (9,371)\nForeign currency translation gains/(losses) (1)\n- - 7,170 7,170 - - (30,799) (30,799)\nIncome tax effect - benefit/(expense) - - 73 73 52 (8) (245) (201)\nNet of tax 3,313 4,869 7,243 15,425 (6,731) (2,596) (31,044) (40,371)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI into earnings:\nRealized gains/(losses) (2)\n(239) (668) - (907) 527 (2,097) - (1,570)\nIncome tax effect - benefit/(expense) (3)\n54 85 - 139 (2) 332 - 330\nNet of tax (185) (583) - (768) 525 (1,765) - (1,240)\nNet current-period other comprehensive income/(loss) 3,128 4,286 7,243 14,657 (6,206) (4,361) (31,044) (41,611)\nEnding Balance $ (2,858) $ (197) $ (33,929) $ (36,984) $ (5,986) $ (4,483) $ (41,172) $ (51,641)\n(1)The foreign currency translation gains during fiscal 2023 were primarily due to the strengthening of other foreign currencies as compared to the U.S. dollar. The foreign currency translation losses during fiscal 2022 were primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar as compared to other foreign currencies.\n(2)Realized gains or losses, if any, from the sale of our AFS investment securities or from foreign currency translation adjustments are included within other income/(expense), net in our consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains or losses on foreign currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges are included in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n(3)The income tax benefit or expense is included within provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations.\n11. Earnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income attributable to Dolby Laboratories, Inc. by the number of weighted-average shares of Class A and Class B common stock outstanding during the period. Through application of the treasury stock method, diluted EPS is computed in the same manner, except that the number of weighted-average shares outstanding is increased by the number of potentially dilutive shares from employee incentive plans during the period.\nBasic and diluted EPS are computed independently for each fiscal quarter and year-to-date period, which involves the use of different weighted-average share count figures relating to quarterly and annual periods. As a result, and after factoring the effect of rounding to the nearest cent per share, the sum of all four quarter-to-date EPS figures may not equal year-to-date EPS.\nPotentially dilutive shares represent the hypothetical number of incremental shares issuable under the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and unvested) and vesting of outstanding RSUs. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes securities that would have an antidilutive effect on EPS.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS attributable to Dolby Laboratories, Inc. (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nNumerator:\nNet income attributable to Dolby Laboratories, Inc. $ 200,656 $ 184,087 $ 310,227\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average shares outstanding-basic 95,771 99,990 101,190\nPotential common shares from options to purchase common stock 763 958 1,994\nPotential common shares from restricted stock units 1,139 912 1,376\nPotential common shares from employee stock purchase plan 60 123 62\nWeighted-average shares outstanding-diluted 97,733 101,983 104,622\nNet income per share attributable to Dolby Laboratories, Inc.:\nBasic $ 2.10 $ 1.84 $ 3.07\nDiluted $ 2.05 $ 1.81 $ 2.97\nAntidilutive awards excluded from calculation:\nStock options 930 587 235\nRestricted stock units 7 1,158 48\nEmployee stock purchase plan 2 - 2\n12. Income Taxes\nOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future liabilities. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense.\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe following two tables present the components of our income before provision for income taxes by geographic region and the portion of our provision for income taxes classified as current and deferred (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nUnited States $ 44,136 $ 33,318 $ 104,741\nForeign 205,917 181,961 249,771\nTotal income before income taxes $ 250,053 $ 215,279 $ 354,512\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nCurrent:\nFederal $ (1,053) $ 2,008 $ 7,216\nState 1,023 553 953\nForeign 66,776 58,285 65,568\nTotal current 66,746 60,846 73,737\nDeferred:\nFederal (16,949) (29,990) (36,035)\nState (356) 8 (63)\nForeign (1,032) 517 (950)\nTotal deferred (18,337) (29,465) (37,048)\nProvision for income taxes $ 48,409 $ 31,381 $ 36,689\nRepatriation of Undistributed Foreign Earnings\nAs a result of the Tax Act, foreign accumulated earnings that were subject to the mandatory Transition Tax as of December 31, 2017, can be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring further U.S. federal tax. The Tax Act changed to a modified territorial tax system through the provision of a 100% dividend received deduction for the foreign-source portions of dividends received from controlled foreign subsidiaries. As a result, we have reevaluated our historical assertion and determined that we no longer consider a vast majority of these earnings to be indefinitely reinvested. During fiscal 2023, we repatriated $150 million of foreign subsidiary earnings which were exempt from foreign withholding tax. As of September 29, 2023, the total undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries were approximately $224 million. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on the portion of the undistributed earnings considered indefinitely reinvested is not material.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. A summary of the tax effects of the temporary differences were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nDeferred income tax assets:\nInvestments $ 5,864 $ 1,339\nInventories 5,003 6,851\nNet operating loss 292 2,507\nAccrued expenses 16,945 11,536\nStock-based compensation 17,833 17,295\nRevenue recognition 4,563 4,275\nDepreciation and amortization (1)\n130,818 105,114\nLease liability 13,911 10,589\nResearch and development credits 40,633 40,149\nForeign tax credits 15,684 21,244\nDeemed repatriated earnings tax benefit 10,724 10,724\nOther 5,075 5,657\nTotal gross deferred income tax assets 267,345 237,280\nLess: valuation allowance (50,687) (41,087)\nTotal deferred income tax assets 216,658 196,193\nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nRight of use asset (14,319) (10,046)\nIntangible assets (479) (2,579)\nDeferred income tax assets, net $ 201,860 $ 183,568\n(1)Provisions enacted in the Tax Act related to the capitalization for tax purposes of research and development expenditures became effective on October 1,\n2022. These provisions require us to capitalize research and development expenditures and amortize them on our U.S. tax return over five or fifteen\nyears, depending on where research is conducted.\nNet Operating Losses and Tax Credit Carryforwards\nAs of September 29, 2023, the NOL carryforwards for U.S. federal and California were $1.7 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and will start to expire in fiscal 2034 and 2029, respectively. As of September 29, 2023, we had foreign tax credit and federal R&D tax credit carryforwards of $6.3 million and $18.3 million, respectively, which will start to expire in fiscal 2029 and fiscal 2035, respectively. We had California R&D tax credits of $44.3 million, which will carry forward indefinitely, and foreign R&D tax credits of $5.1 million, which will start to expire in fiscal 2028.\nValuation Allowance\nAs of September 29, 2023, a $34.9 million valuation allowance was recorded against California deferred tax assets, a $7.5 million valuation allowance was recorded against federal tax credit deferred tax assets, and a $8.3 million valuation allowance was recorded against foreign deferred tax assets for which ultimate realization of its future benefits is uncertain.\nEffective Tax Rate\nEach period, the combination of multiple different factors can impact our effective tax rate. These factors include both recurring items such as tax rates and the relative amount of income earned in foreign jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in, but are not necessarily consistent between periods. A reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to our effective tax rate on income from continuing operations was as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nFederal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal effect 0.3 0.2 0.2\nStock-based compensation 1.2 (0.1) (5.1)\nResearch and development tax credits (2.7) (5.0) (2.6)\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction (2.3) (2.3) (2.2)\nU.S. tax on foreign entities 1.3 1.8 0.8\nForeign rate differential (1.9) (4.5) (3.4)\nIncrease (decrease) unrecognized tax benefit 1.9 2.8 2.0\nOther 0.6 0.7 (0.4)\nEffective tax rate 19.4 % 14.6 % 10.3 %\nOur effective tax rate was 19.4% in fiscal 2023, compared with our federal statutory rate of 21.0%, and with our effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 of 14.6%. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lower tax benefits related to settlement of stock-based awards and reduced benefit from less research and development tax credits.\nOur effective tax rate was 14.6% in fiscal 2022, compared with our effective tax rate in fiscal 2021 of 10.3%. The increase in our effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the mix of earnings to jurisdictions with higher tax rates and lower tax benefits related to settlement of stock-based awards partially offset by benefit from additional research and development tax credits.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs of September 29, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $76.3 million, of which $47.2 million, if recognized, would reduce our effective tax rate. Our liability increased from fiscal 2022 primarily due to additional accruals in fiscal 2023. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits is classified within other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Over the next twelve months, we estimate that this amount could be reduced by $4.8 million as a result of the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. Aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nBeginning Balance $ 69,682 $ 66,106 $ 60,691\nGross increases - tax positions taken during prior years 219 822 220\nGross decreases - tax positions taken during prior years (1,143) (178) (247)\nGross increases - tax positions taken during current year 7,546 7,784 6,979\nGross decreases - settlements with tax authorities during current year - - (875)\nLapse of statute of limitations - (4,852) (662)\nEnding Balance $ 76,304 $ 69,682 $ 66,106\nClassification of Interest and Penalties\nWe include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes. To the extent accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued are reduced in the period that such determination is made and are reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision. In fiscal year 2023, our current tax provision was increased by interest expense of $3.5 million, while in fiscal year 2022, our current tax provision was increased by interest expense of $1.7 million. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line item in our consolidated balance sheets. Our accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\nAccrued interest $ 10,254 $ 6,748\nAccrued penalties 172 119\nTotal $ 10,426 $ 6,867\nWe continue to monitor the progress of ongoing income tax controversies and the impact, if any, of the expected tolling of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal, states, and foreign jurisdictions. Our major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal, California, New York, and Ireland.\nOur operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for fiscal 2015 to 2022, some of which are currently under audit or review. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If resolution of any tax issues addressed in our current audits are inconsistent with managements expectations, we may be required to adjust our tax provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\nThe final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations, issued January 4, 2022, introduced significant changes to foreign tax credit utilization. However, a one year relief delayed the effective date of the final U.S. foreign tax credit regulations until our fiscal 2024. These provisions are expected to have a material adverse effect on our fiscal 2024 and future tax provisions unless postponed or modified.\n13. Restructuring\nRestructuring charges recorded in our consolidated statements of operations represent costs associated with separate individual restructuring plans implemented in various fiscal periods. Costs arising from these actions, including fluctuations in related balances between fiscal periods, are based on the nature of activities under the various plans.\nFiscal 2023 Restructuring Events.\nIn September 2023, we initiated a restructuring plan with the purpose of focusing our resources on our highest strategic priorities. We recorded expense of $13.4 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 160 impacted employees. In conjunction with focusing our resources on our top strategic priorities, we recorded an impairment loss of $16.9 million related primarily to internally developed software for projects we are no longer pursuing. Cash payment of the severance and other termination benefits is expected to be completed by the second half of fiscal 2024.\nIn June 2023, we implemented a focused restructuring plan, primarily consisting of workforce reductions and facility consolidations to improve execution in alignment with our strategy and to reduce our cost structure through improved utilization of our global infrastructure. As a result of these events, we recorded expense of $10.9 million in severance and other related benefits offered to approximately 130 impacted employees, and we recorded expense of $6.9 million related to a facility consolidation in New York, NY. Actions related to this plan are expected to be completed by the second half of fiscal 2024. The table presented below summarizes the changes in our restructuring accruals (in thousands):\nSeverance Leased facility exit costs and other costs Total\nBalance at September 24, 2021 $ 163 $ 4 $ 167\nRestructuring charges 8,874 1,749 10,623\nCash payments and adjustments (3,256) (1,753) (5,009)\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 5,781 $ - $ 5,781\nRestructuring charges 23,943 23,118 47,061\nCash payments and adjustments (9,372) (16,225) (25,597)\nNon-cash adjustment for leased facility exit costs - (6,893) (6,893)\nBalance at September 29, 2023 $ 20,352 $ - $ 20,352\nThe fiscal 2022 activities primarily related to our fiscal 2022 restructuring plan within our entertainment organization to align resources with a revised business strategy and outlook, and to support our higher priority focus areas.\nAccruals for restructuring charges incurred for the restructuring plan described above are included within accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while restructuring charges are included within restructuring charges in our consolidated statements of operations.\n14. Commitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual agreements with third parties that include non-cancelable payment obligations, for which we are liable in future periods. These arrangements can include terms binding us to minimum payments and/or penalties if we terminate the agreement for any reason other than an event of default as described by the agreement. The following table presents a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 29, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayments Due By Fiscal Period\nFiscal\n2024 Fiscal\n2025 Fiscal\n2026 Fiscal\n2027 Fiscal\n2028 Thereafter Total\nNaming rights $ 12,794 $ 13,126 $ 13,472 $ 8,534 $ 8,642 $ 35,674 $ 92,242\nPurchase obligations 29,934 3,816 851 - - - 34,601\nDonation commitments 1,718 116 116 86 86 332 2,454\nTotal $ 44,446 $ 17,058 $ 14,439 $ 8,620 $ 8,728 $ 36,006 $ 129,297\nNaming Rights. We are party to agreements for naming rights of certain facilities, most significantly for naming rights and related benefits with respect to the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California, the location of the Academy Awards\u00ae. The term of this agreement is 20 years, over which we will make payments on a semi-annual basis until fiscal 2032. Our ongoing annual payment obligations are conditioned in part on the Academy Awards being held and broadcast from the Dolby Theatre. Our payment obligations may be suspended or reduced in certain circumstances, including the protracted closure of the Dolby Theatre. We also hold the naming rights to Dolby Live at the Park MGM in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dolby Live is a fully integrated performance venue offering live concerts in Dolby Atmos.\nPurchase Obligations. Purchase obligations primarily consist of our commitments made under agreements to purchase goods and services related to Dolby Cinema and for purposes that include information technology and telecommunications, marketing and professional services, and other R&D activities. Also included in purchase obligations are non-cancelable commitments to contract manufacturers, including potentially variable obligations related to inventory based on demand forecasts we provide to the contract manufacturers.\nDonation Commitments. Our donation commitments relate to non-cancelable obligations that consist of maintenance services and installation of imaging and audio products in exchange for various marketing, branding, and publicity benefits. These donation agreements either transfer title of our audio and imaging products to the donee or offer use of the products free of charge for a specified period of time via a leasing arrangement. The recipients of these donations participate in or promote the cinema and entertainment industry and our commitments vary in length, lasting up to 15 years.\nIndemnification Clauses. On a limited basis, our contractual agreements contain a clause under which we agree to provide indemnification to the counterparty, most commonly to licensees in connection with licensing arrangements that include our IP. We have also entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations. Additionally, and although not a contractual requirement, we have at times elected to defend our licensees from third\nparty IP infringement claims. Since the terms and conditions of our contractual indemnification clauses do not explicitly specify our obligations, we are unable to reasonably estimate the maximum potential exposure for which we could be liable.\n15. Business Combinations\nMPEG LA\nOn April 28, 2023, our wholly-owned subsidiary Via Licensing Corporation (\"Via Corp\") acquired 100% of MPEG LA, L.L.C. (\"MPEG LA\"), a privately held patent pool administrator that managed several collaborative licensing programs in video imaging and other technologies. In connection with the transaction, Via Corp changed its structure and name to Via Licensing Alliance LLC (\"Via LA\") and became a majority owned subsidiary of Dolby. The acquisition is expected to strengthen Via LA's licensing capabilities, particularly in video, diversify its revenues, and reinforce its ability to develop new patent licensing programs. The total consideration for the acquisition was as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nCash $ 135,739\nNoncontrolling interest in Via LA (24.8 million common equity units)\n24,815\nTotal amount paid to sellers $ 160,554\nLess: amount deemed post-acquisition expense (2,174)\nTotal consideration paid to sellers $ 158,380\nAssumed settlement of pre-existing relationships due to Dolby 61,313\nTotal consideration $ 219,693\nLess: unrestricted cash acquired (80,633)\nTotal consideration, net of unrestricted cash acquired $ 139,060\nThe noncontrolling interest in Via LA includes $3.6 million of cash held in escrow that will be fully remitted to Dolby in exchange for Via LA common equity units after 18 months from the transaction close date. The fair value of the noncontrolling interest was determined through the issuance of equity in lieu of cash. The assumed settlement of pre-existing relationships was determined based on the contractual amounts of payables and receivables between the parties as such amounts approximate fair value.\nWe have accounted for the taxable transaction under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and the results of operations of MPEG LA have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition and were not material. Additionally, we have estimated the fair values of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date, with any amounts paid in excess of the net assets recorded as goodwill. The fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on managements estimates and assumptions and may be subject to change as additional information is received and certain tax returns are finalized, including potential changes to income tax-related accounts. We expect to finalize the valuation within the one year measurement period. As this acquisition was not significant to our reported operating results, pro forma results of operations are not provided.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary acquisition date fair values allocated to the net assets acquired (in thousands):\nRecognized Identifiable Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed Purchase Price Allocation (Preliminary)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 80,633\nRestricted cash 143,564\nOther current assets 73,556\nIntangible assets 86,000\nGoodwill 40,579\nOther non-current assets 34,298\nAmounts payable to patent administrative program partners (179,616)\nOther current liabilities (21,709)\nNon-current liabilities (37,612)\nPurchase Consideration $ 219,693\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we identified an immaterial error related to the preliminary acquisition date fair values allocated to net assets acquired, whereby we overstated certain accounts payable to patent administrative program partners and, as a consequence, correspondingly overstated goodwill as of the quarter ended June 30, 2023. We evaluated the error quantitatively and qualitatively, and determined that the related impact was not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Accordingly, we have revised the previously reported financial information for such immaterial error in the above table. The correction of this error resulted in a decrease to amounts payable to patent administrative program partners and a corresponding decrease to goodwill of $20.3 million, with no impact to total purchase consideration.\nGoodwill is representative of our expectation of the benefits and synergies from the integration of MPEG LA operations and the assembled workforce of MPEG LA, which does not qualify for separate recognition as an intangible asset. All of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values allocated to the various intangible assets acquired and the weighted-average useful lives over which they will be amortized using the straight-line method:\nPurchase Price Allocation Weighted-Average Useful Life\nIntangible Assets Acquired (in thousands) (in years)\nLicensor Relationships - AVC & Other $ 36,000 13\nLicensor Relationships - HEVC 31,000 10\nImplementer Relationships - AVC & Other 12,000 13\nImplementer Relationships - HEVC 7,000 10\nTotal $ 86,000 12\nThe preliminary value of acquired intangibles was determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using the following methodologies and inputs:\nLicensor Relationships - the multi-period excess earnings method using inputs such as projected revenue attributable to licensors in the patent pools, revenue retention rate, maintenance sales and marketing expenses, income tax rate, post-tax returns for contributory assets, and discount rate.\nImplementer Relationships - the distributor method using inputs such as projected revenue attributable to the existing implementers in the patent pools, distributor margin, income tax rate, and discount rate.\nAcquisition-related costs of $3.8 million were incurred during fiscal 2023. These acquisition-related costs were included in G&A expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nMillicast\nOn January 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of all outstanding interests of Millicast, a privately held company. Following the acquisition, Millicast is expected to enable developers to take the interactive events they build with Dolby.io, and stream them from the presenter to large audiences. We have included the financial results of Millicast in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, and these results were not material. Additionally, the transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not material.\nThe total purchase consideration of the acquisition was $38.8 million. We allocated $8.7 million in purchase consideration to identifiable intangible assets, which primarily consisted of developed technology, with estimated useful lives of 1.5 years to 8 years. We also recorded $31.7 million of goodwill, which is representative of our expectation of benefits and synergies from the integration of Millicast technology with our existing technology and the assembled workforce of Millicast.\n16. Operating Segments and Geographic Information\nOperating Segments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available, and which are evaluated regularly by the CODM, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Our CODM is our Chief Executive Officer. Reporting segments are operating\nsegments exceeding specified revenue, profit or loss, or asset thresholds for which separate disclosure of information is necessary.\nWe operate as a single reportable segment. This reflects the fact that our CODM continues to evaluate our financial information and resources, and continues to assess the performance of these resources, on a consolidated basis. All required financial segment information is therefore included in our consolidated financial statements.\nGeographic Information\nThe methods to determine revenue by geographic region for each of the three categories included within total revenue in our consolidated statements of operations are described within the table presented below.\nRevenue Category Basis For Determining Geographic Location\nLicensing Region in which our licensees headquarters are located\nProducts Destination to which our products are shipped\nServices Location in which the relevant services are performed\nThe following tables present selected information regarding total revenue by geographic location (amounts presented in thousands).\nRevenue Composition-U.S. and International\nFiscal Year Ended\nLocation September 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nUnited States $ 466,030 $ 468,246 $ 419,901\nInternational 833,714 785,547 861,355\nTotal revenue $ 1,299,744 $ 1,253,793 $ 1,281,256\nRevenue Concentration-Significant Individual Geographic Regions\nFiscal Year Ended\nLocation September 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nUnited States 36 % 37 % 33 %\nSouth Korea 14 % 13 % 14 %\nChina 22 % 20 % 23 %\nJapan 9 % 8 % 11 %\nEurope 10 % 10 % 10 %\nOther 9 % 12 % 9 %\nTotal 100 % 100 % 100 %\nLong-lived tangible assets, net of accumulated depreciation, by geographic region were as follows (in thousands):\nLocation September 29,\n2023 September 30,\nUnited States $ 390,552 $ 415,493\nInternational 91,029 97,988\nTotal long-lived tangible assets, net of accumulated depreciation $ 481,581 $ 513,481\n17. Legal Matters\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings that occasionally arise in the normal course of business. These can include claims of alleged infringement of IP rights, commercial, employment, and other matters. In our opinion, resolution of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate based on the known facts and circumstances whether a potential loss or range of losses is considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We record a provision for a liability relating to these legal proceedings when a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs associated with these legal proceedings are expensed as incurred.\nGiven the unpredictable nature of legal proceedings, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more such proceedings could materially affect our future operating results or financial condition in a particular period, including as a result of required changes to our licensing terms, monetary penalties, and other potential consequences. However, based on the information known by us as of the date of this filing and the rules and regulations applicable to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, any such amounts are either immaterial, or it is not probable that a potential loss has been incurred or the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated.\n18. Related Parties\nWe maintain contractual agreements relating to certain entities affiliated with the Dolby family, who is considered a related party as our principal stockholder. These jointly-owned entities were established for the purpose of acquiring and leasing commercial property in the U.S. and U.K. primarily for our operational use. Although the entities affiliated with the Dolby family hold a majority economic interest in such jointly-owned entities, they have a noncontrolling interest since they are the limited member or LP in each of these entities. Therefore, we have consolidated the entities assets and liabilities and results of operations in our consolidated financial statements. The share of earnings and net assets of the entities attributable to the limited member or LP, as the case may be, is reflected as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur interests in these consolidated affiliated entities and the location of the properties leased to Dolby Laboratories as of September 29, 2023 were as follows:\nEntity Name Minority Ownership Interest Location Of Properties\nDolby Properties Burbank, LLC 49.0 % Burbank, California\nWe also own 10.0% minority ownership interest in Dolby Properties, LP, which owns a facility in Wootton Bassett, England. During fiscal 2022, we ceased leasing the Wootton Bassett facility. The property leased to Dolby Laboratories through Dolby Properties Brisbane, LLC, located in Brisbane, California, was sold during fiscal 2021.\nWe also lease from our principal stockholder a commercial office building located at 100 Potrero Avenue in San Francisco, California under a term that expires on October 31, 2024. Related party rent expense included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nRelated party rent expense included in operating expenses $ - $ - $ (392)\nDistributions. Distributions made by the jointly-owned real estate entities to our principal stockholder were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nDistributions to principal stockholder $ (266) $ (1,435) $ (7,362)\n19. Retirement Plans\nWe maintain a tax-qualified Section 401(k) retirement plan for employees in the U.S. and similar plans in foreign jurisdictions. Under the plan, employees are eligible to receive matching contributions and profit-sharing contributions. We also maintain a SERP, a non-qualified, employer-funded defined contribution retirement plan which was terminated in fiscal 2005.\nRetirement plan expenses, which are included in cost of products and services, R&D, S&M, and G&A expense in our consolidated statements of operations, were as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29,\n2023 September 30,\n2022 September 24,\nRetirement plan expenses $ 24,925 $ 27,378 $ 26,379 ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain \"disclosure controls and procedures,\" as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as amended, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nSubject to the limitations noted above, our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to meet the objective for which they were designed and operate at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO. Based on this assessment and those criteria, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2023. The Company acquired MPEG LA during fiscal 2023. Management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2023, MPEG LA's internal control over financial reporting which represented 12% of total assets and less than 1.5% of total revenue included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 29, 2023.\nOur internal control over financial reporting has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the impact of the acquisition of MPEG LA, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 29, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers\nDuring the fiscal quarter ending September 29, 2023, the following officer, as defined in Rule 16a-1(f), adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement as defined in Regulation S-K Item 408, as follows:\nOn August 21, 2023, John Couling, our Senior Vice President, Entertainment, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement providing for the sale from time to time of an aggregate of up to 83,560 shares of our Class A common stock.
