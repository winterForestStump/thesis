    "content": "ITEM 1.BUSINESS\nOverview\nThe Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Companys therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes.\nThe Companys pipeline of 14 clinical stage investigational medicines range in development stage from Phase 1 to Phase 3. In addition, the Company has a robust discovery stage pipeline which is capable of generating multiple new clinical candidates each year.\n20 in 25 Pipeline Development Strategy\nThe Company believes that there is no shortage of need that it can endeavor to serve and no shortage of lives that potentially can be touched by the versatility of RNAi technology. The Company endeavors to serve unmet needs and change lives leveraging the versatility of RNAi technology. The Company is acutely aware of the urgent need to develop solutions for the many diseases that have genetic targets that are otherwise undruggable by small molecules or biologics. To that end, the Company embraced its bold goal and strives to have 20 individual drugs, either partnered or wholly owned, in clinical trials or on the market in 2025.\nRNA Interference and the Benefits of RNAi Therapeutics\nRNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.\nSmall molecule and antibody drugs have proven effective at inhibiting certain cell surface, intracellular, and extracellular targets. However, other drug targets have proven difficult to inhibit with traditional drug-based and biologic therapeutics. Developing effective drugs for these targets would have the potential to address large underserved markets for the treatment of many diseases. Using the ability to specifically silence any gene, RNAi therapeutics may be able to address previously undruggable targets, unlocking the market potential of such targets.\nThis figure depicts the mechanism by which gene silencing occurs. Double stranded RNAi triggers are introduced into a cell and are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex, (RISC). The strands are then separated, leaving an active RISC/RNAi trigger complex. This complex can then pair with and degrade the complementary messenger RNAs (mRNA) and stop the production of the target proteins. RNAi is a catalytic process, so each RNAi trigger can degrade mRNA hundreds of times, which results in a relatively long duration of effect for RNAi therapeutics.\nKey Benefits of RNAi as a Therapeutic Modality\nSilences the expression of disease associated genes;\nPotential to address any target in the transcriptome including previously undruggable targets;\nRapid lead identification;\nHigh specificity;\nOpportunity to use multiple RNA sequences in one drug product for synergistic silencing of related targets; and\nRNAi therapeutics are uniquely suited for personalized medicine through target and cell specific delivery and gene knockdown.\nTargeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) Platform\nThe Companys Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiMTM) platform utilizes ligand-mediated delivery and is designed to enable tissue-specific targeting while being structurally simple. Targeting has been core to the Companys development philosophy and the TRiMTM platform builds on more than a decade of work on actively targeted drug delivery vehicles. The Companys scientists have discovered ways to progressively TRiM away extraneous features and chemistries and retain optimal pharmacologic activity.\nThe TRiMTM platform is comprised of a highly potent RNA trigger identified using the Companys proprietary trigger selection rules and algorithms with the following components optimized, as needed, for each drug candidate: a high affinity targeting ligand; various linker and chemistries; structures that enhance pharmacokinetics; and highly potent RNAi triggers with sequence specific stabilization chemistries.\nTherapeutics developed with the TRiMTM platform offer several advantages: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration; and potential for improved safety because there are less metabolites from smaller molecules, thereby reducing the risk of intracellular buildup. The Company also believes that for RNAi to reach its true potential, it must target organs outside the liver. The Company is leading this expansion with the TRiMTM platform, which has shown the potential to reach multiple tissues, including liver, lung, central nervous system (CNS), muscle, and adipose tissue.\nRNA Chemistries\nThe structure and chemistries of the oligonucleotide molecules used to trigger the RNAi mechanism can be tailored for optimal activity. The Companys broad portfolio of RNA trigger structures and chemistries, including some proprietary structures, enable the Company to optimize each drug candidate on a target-by-target basis and utilize the combination of structure and chemical modifications that yield the most potent RNAi trigger.\nAs a component of the TRiMTM platform, the Companys design philosophy for RNA chemical modifications is to start with a structurally simple molecule and add only selective modification and stabilization chemistries as necessary to achieve the desired level of target knockdown and duration of effect. The conceptual framework for the stabilization strategy starts with a more sophisticated RNAi trigger screening and selection process that identifies potent sequences rapidly in locations that others may miss.\nPipeline\nThe Company is focused on developing innovative drugs for diseases with a genetic basis, typically characterized by the overproduction of one or more proteins that are involved with disease. The depth and versatility of the Companys RNAi technologies enables the Company to potentially address conditions in virtually any therapeutic area and pursue disease targets that are not otherwise addressable by small molecules and biologic. The Company is focused on bringing the promise of RNAi to address diseases outside of the liver, and its pipeline now includes disease targets in the liver, lung, muscle and CNS.\nPlozasiran (ARO-APOC3)\nPlozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3) is designed to reduce production of Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III), a component of triglyceride rich lipoproteins (TRLs) including Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicrons and a key regulator of triglyceride metabolism. The Company believes that knocking down the hepatic production of apoC-III may result in reduced VLDL synthesis and assembly, enhanced breakdown of TRLs, and better clearance of VLDL and chylomicron remnants. The Company is currently investigating plozasiran in two Phase 2b clinical trials, one Phase 3 clinical trial, and additional Phase 3 clinical trials on schedule to begin in 2024.\nHypertriglyceridemia: Elevated triglyceride levels are an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Severely elevated triglycerides (often over 2,000 mg/dL) in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), a rare genetic disorder, can result in potentially fatal acute pancreatitis.\nStudy Name: Study to Evaluate ARO-APOC3 in Adults With Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (SHASTA-2)\nA Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ARO-APOC3 in Adults With Severe Hypertriglyceridemia\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04720534\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-APOC3 in Adults With Mixed Dyslipidemia (MUIR)\nA Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ARO-APOC3 in Adults With Mixed Dyslipidemia\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04998201\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-APOC3 in Adults With FCS (PALISADE)\nA Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ARO-APOC3 in Adults With Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05089084\nZodasiran (ARO-ANG3)\nZodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3) is designed to reduce production of angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3), a liver synthesized inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase and endothelial lipase. ANGPTL3 inhibition has been shown to lower serum LDL, serum and liver triglyceride and has genetic validation as a novel target for cardiovascular disease. The Company is currently investigating zodasiran in two Phase 2b clinical trials.\nDyslipidemia and Hypertriglyceridemia: Dyslipidemia and hypertriglyceridemia are risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and cardiovascular events.\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-ANG3 in Adults With Mixed Dyslipidemia (ARCHES-2)\nA Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of ARO-ANG3 in Adults With Mixed Dyslipidemia\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04832971\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-ANG3 in Participants With Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) (GATEWAY)\nPhase 2 Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of ARO-ANG3 in Subjects with Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH)\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05217667\nARO-PNPLA3\nARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795) is an investigational RNAi therapeutic designed to reduce liver expression of patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) as a potential treatment for patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). PNPLA3 has strong genetic and preclinical validation as a driver of fat accumulation and damage in the livers of patients who carry the common I148M mutation. Former licensee Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. investigated ARO-PNPLA3 in two Phase 1 clinical trials and the Company is currently designing a Phase 2 clinical trial.\nNASH: NASH is a subgroup of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in which hepatic cell injury and inflammation has developed over background steatosis. The I148M genetic variant in the PNPLA3 gene is involved with the underlying pathophysiology and is a known risk factor for hepatic steatosis, steatohepatitis, elevated plasma liver enzyme levels, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The rising prevalence of NASH presents a significant health burden in many developed countries.\nARO-RAGE\nARO-RAGE is designed to reduce production of the Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) as a potential treatment for various inflammatory pulmonary diseases. The Company is currently investigating ARO-RAGE in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial.\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-RAGE in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Inflammatory Lung Disease\nA Phase 1/2a Study Evaluating the Effects of ARO-RAGE in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Inflammatory Lung Disease\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05276570\nARO-MUC5AC\nARO-MUC5AC is designed to reduce production of mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) as a potential treatment for various muco-obstructive pulmonary diseases. The Company is currently investigating ARO-MUC5AC in a phase 1/2a clinical trial.\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-MUC5AC in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Muco-Obstructive Lung Disease\nA Phase 1/2a Study to Evaluate the Effects of ARO-MUC5AC in Healthy Subjects and Patients with Muco-Obstructive Lung Disease\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05292950\nARO-MMP7\nARO-MMP7 is designed to reduce expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) as a potential treatment for idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). The Company is currently investigating ARO-MMP7 in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial.\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-MMP7 Inhalation Solution in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis\nA Phase 1/2a Study Evaluating the Effects of ARO-MMP7 Inhalation Solution in Healthy Subjects and Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05537025\nARO-DUX4\nARO-DUX4 is designed to target the gene that encodes human double homeobox 4 (DUX4) protein as a potential treatment for patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy.\nFacioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is an autosomal dominant disease associated with the failure to maintain complete epigenetic suppression of DUX4 expression in differentiated skeletal muscle, leading to overexpression of DUX4, which is myotoxic and can lead to muscle degeneration. As DUX4 expression is recognized as the cause of muscle pathology in FSHD patients, the Company believes that the selective targeting and knockdown of DUX4 using RNAi may prevent or reverse downstream myotoxicity and lead to muscle repair and improvement in muscle function in patients. There are currently no effective treatments specifically for FSHD.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT06131983\nARO-SOD1\nARO-SOD1 is designed to target the gene that encodes human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) protein as a potential treatment for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) harboring a SOD1 mutations.\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): ALS is a fatal motoneuronal disorder that causes progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons in the primary motor cortex, brainstem, and spinal cord. Among the genetically defined ALS cases, about 15% are associated with dominantly inherited mutations in the SOD1 gene. Although the exact disease-causing mechanism of SOD1 mutations remains incompletely understood, there is a consensus that there is a toxic gain-of-function leading to toxicity induced by aggregation of mutant SOD1 in neurons.\nStudy Name: Study of AROSOD-1 in Adult Participants With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)\nA Phase 1 Randomized Placebo-Controlled Dose Escalation Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of ARO-SOD1 in Adult Patients With Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Harboring a Superoxide Dismutase-1 Mutation Considered to be Causative of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05949294\nARO-C3\nARO-C3 is designed to reduce production of complement component 3 (C3) as a potential therapy for patients with various complement mediated or complement associated renal diseases. The Company is currently investigating ARO-C3 in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial.\nComplement-Mediated Renal Disease: A number of rare renal diseases result from uncontrolled activation of the alternative pathway of complement, leading to progressive glomerular damage, proteinuria, hematuria, and impaired kidney function, and often resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In addition, dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis and progression of disease in some of the more common glomerulopathies. Silencing C3 may be a therapeutic approach for treatment of these conditions.\nStudy Name: Study of ARO-C3 in Adult Healthy Volunteers and Patients With Complement-Mediated Renal Disease\nA Phase 1/2a Dose-Escalating Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and/or Pharmacodynamics of ARO-C3 in Adult Healthy Volunteers and in Adult Patients With Complement-Mediated Renal Disease\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05083364\nCollaboration and License Agreements\nGlaxosmithkline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited (GSK)\nOn November 22, 2021, GSK and the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the GSK License Agreement). Under the GSK License Agreement, GSK has received an exclusive license for GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD). The exclusive license is worldwide with the exception of greater China. GSK is wholly responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of GSK-4532990 in its territory.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $120.0 million, and an additional payment of $30.0 million was received at the start of a Phase 2 clinical trial. The Company is also eligible for an additional payment of $100.0 million upon achieving the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, should the Phase 3 trial read out positively, and the potential new medicine receives regulatory approval in major markets, the deal provides for commercial milestone payments to the Company of up to $190.0 million at first commercial sale, and up to $590.0 million in sales-related milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales in a range of mid-teens to twenty percent.\nGSK-4532990\nGSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD) is designed to reduce production of HSD17B13, a hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase involved in the metabolism of hormones, fatty acids and bile acids. Published human genetic data indicate that a loss of function mutation in HSD17B13 provides strong protection against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) cirrhosis and alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. GSK is conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial.\nNonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: NASH is liver inflammation and damage caused by a buildup of fat in the liver. This can cause scarring of the liver and in advanced cases can lead to cirrhosis.\nStudy Name: Phase 2b Study of GSK4532990 in Adults With NASH (HORIZON)\n17 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 13 Minimization for the Treatment of NASH (HORIZON): A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of GSK4532990 in Adults With Pre-Cirrhotic Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05583344\nHorizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC (Horizon)\nOn June 18, 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the Horizon License Agreement). Under the terms of the Horizon License Agreement, Horizon received a worldwide exclusive license for HZN-457, a clinical-stage medicine being developed by Horizon as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout. Horizon is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of HZN-457. On October 6, 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $40.0 million, and an additional payment of $15.0 million was received at the start of a Phase 1 clinical trial. On November 21, 2023, the Company received notice from Horizon that it has elected to terminate the Horizon License Agreement. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience. The termination will take effect on December 21, 2023.\nHZN-457\nHZN-457 is designed to reduce production of xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH) as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout. Gout is a serious and painful form of arthritis that is caused by excess uric acid in the blood. In the United States, there are more than nine million gout patients and approximately one-third of those patients are treated with oral urate-lowering therapies. However, a meaningful portion of treated patients do not respond sufficiently to treatment and therefore continue to experience painful and debilitating gout symptoms. XDH represents a clinically validated target that is the primary source of serum uric acid (sUA). High levels of sUA, if left untreated or undertreated, can potentially lead to serious long-term or even permanent damage to the bones, joints and organs.\nStudy Name: Study to Evaluate HZN-457 in Healthy Volunteers\nA Phase 1 Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Single Ascending Dose Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of HZN-457 in Healthy Volunteers\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05565768\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda)\nOn October 7, 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Co-Funding Agreement (the Takeda License Agreement). Under the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda and the Company co-develop the Companys Fazirsiran program (formerly TAK-999 and ARO-AAT), the Companys second-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a treatment for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Within the United States, fazirsiran, if approved, will be co-commercialized under a 50/50 profit sharing structure. Outside the United States, Takeda received an exclusive license to commercialize fazirsiran and will lead the global commercialization strategy, while the Company will be eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20% to 25% on net sales.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment and an additional payment of $40.0 million at the start of Phase 3. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $527.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\nFazirsiran\nFazirsiran is a subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic being developed as a treatment for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), which is a rare genetic disorder that severely damages the liver and lungs of affected individuals. Fazirsiran is designed to reduce production of the mutant Z-AAT protein by silencing the AAT gene in order to prevent accumulation of Z-AAT in the liver, allow clearance of the accumulated Z-AAT protein, prevent repeated cycles of cellular damage, and possibly prevent or even reverse the progression of liver fibrosis.\nGoal of Fazirsiran Treatment: The goal of Fazirsiran treatment is prevention and potential reversal of Z-AAT accumulation-related liver injury and fibrosis. Reduction of inflammatory Z-AAT protein, which has been clearly defined as the cause of progressive liver disease in AATD patients, is important as it is expected to halt the progression of liver disease and allow fibrotic tissue repair.\nAlpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD): AATD is a genetic disorder associated with liver disease in children and adults, and pulmonary disease in adults. AAT is a circulating glycoprotein protease inhibitor that is primarily synthesized and secreted by liver hepatocytes. Its physiologic function is the inhibition of neutrophil protease to\nprotect healthy lung tissues during inflammation and prevent tissue damage. The most common disease variant, the Z mutant, has a single amino acid substitution that results in improper folding of the protein. The mutant protein cannot be effectively secreted and accumulates in globules in the hepatocytes. This triggers continuous hepatocyte injury, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma.\nCurrent Treatments: Individuals with the homozygous PiZZ genotype have severe deficiency of functional AAT leading to pulmonary disease and hepatocyte injury and liver disease. Lung disease in this patient population is frequently treated with AAT augmentation therapy. However, augmentation therapy does nothing to treat liver disease, and there is no specific therapy for hepatic manifestations. There is a significant unmet need as liver transplant, with its attendant morbidity and mortality, is currently the only available treatment.\nClinical Trials:\nStudy Name: Study to Check the Safety of Fazirsiran and Learn if Fazirsiran Can Help People With Liver Disease and Scarring (Fibrosis) Due to an Abnormal Version of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Protein (REDWOOD)\nREDWOOD - A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3 Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of fazirsiran in the Treatment of Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease With METAVIR Stage to Fibrosis\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05677971\nStudy Name: An Extension Study to Learn About the Long-Term Safety of Fazirsiran and if Fazirsiran Can Help People With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Liver Disease\nA Phase 3, Open-Label Extension Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of fazirsiran in Participants With Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05899673\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen)\nOn October 3, 2018, Janssen, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and the Company entered into a License Agreement (the Janssen License Agreement). The Company also entered into a stock purchase agreement with JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), Johnson & Johnsons venture capital arm (the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement). Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Companys JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV) program, the Companys third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potential therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Companys Phase 1/2 study of JNJ-3989, which the Company was responsible for completing, Janssen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of JNJ-3989.\nUnder the terms of the Janssen License Agreement, the Company received $175.0 million as an upfront payment, $75.0 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in the Companys common stock under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, and milestone and option payments totaling $73.0 million. The Company may receive up to $825.0 million in development and sales milestone payments for the Janssen License Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales up to mid-teens under the Janssen License Agreement.\nOn April 7, 2023, Janssen voluntarily terminated its collaboration agreement with the Company, dated October 3, 2018. Upon termination of the collaboration agreement, the Company regained full rights to ARO-PNPLA3, formerly called JNJ-75220795. ARO-PNPLA3 is in Phase 1 clinical trials that are now being developed by the Company.\nJNJ-3989 (also referred to as JNJ-73763989)\nJNJ-3989 is being developed by Janssen as a potential therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B infection, when used in combination with other therapeutic modalities. JNJ-3989 is a subcutaneous RNAi therapy candidate which is designed to silence all HBV gene products and intervenes upstream of the reverse transcription process where current standard-of-care nucleotide and nucleoside analogues act. The Company believes this, especially the elimination of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), may allow the bodys natural immune defenses to clear the virus and potentially lead to a functional cure. JNJ-3989 is currently being investigated in multiple Phase 2 clinical trials being conducted by Janssen. The Phase 1/2a study and its preceding studies were conducted by the Company.\nClinical Trials:\nStudy Name: A Study of JNJ-73763989 + Nucleos(t)Ide Analog in Participants Co-Infected With Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D Virus (REEF-D)\nA Phase 2, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-Controlled Study With Deferred Active Treatment to Investigate the Efficacy, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of JNJ-73763989 + Nucleos(t)Ide Analog in Participants Co-Infected With Hepatitis B and Hepatitis D Virus\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04535544\nStudy Name: A Study of JNJ-73763989 Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a, Nucleos(t)Ide Analog (NA) With or Without JNJ-56136379 in Treatment-Naive Participants With Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg) Positive Chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) Infection\nA Phase 2, Randomized, Open-label, Multicenter Study to Evaluate Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Treatment With JNJ-73763989, Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2a, Nucleos(t)Ide Analog With or Without JNJ-56136379 in Treatment-naive Patients With HBeAg Positive Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04439539\nStudy Name: A Study to Assess Intrahepatic and Peripheral Changes of Immunologic and Virologic Markers in Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection (INSIGHT)\nA Phase 2 Randomized, Open-label, Parallel-group, Multicenter Study to Assess Intrahepatic and Peripheral Changes of Immunologic and Virologic Markers in Response to Combination Regimens Containing JNJ-73763989 and Nucleos(t)Ide Analog With or Without JNJ-56136379 in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04585789\nStudy Name: An Efficacy and Safety Study of a Combination of JNJ-73763989, Nucleos(t)Ide Analogs (NA), and a Programmed Cell Death Protein Receptor-1 (PD-1) Inhibitor in Chronic Hepatitis B Participants (OCTOPUS-1)\nA Phase 2 Open-label Trial to Evaluate Safety, Efficacy, Tolerability, and Pharmacodynamics of a Combination of JNJ-73763989, Nucleos(t)Ide Analogs, and a PD-1 Inhibitor in Chronic Hepatitis B Patients\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05275023\nStudy Name: A Study of JNJ-73763989, JNJ-64300535, and Nucleos(t)Ide Analogs in Virologically Suppressed, Hepatitis B e Antigen (HBeAg)- Negative Participants With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection (OSPREY)\nA Phase 1b, Open-label, Single-arm, Multicenter Study to Assess Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Treatment With JNJ-73763989, JNJ-64300535, and Nucleos(t)Ide Analogs in Virologically Suppressed, HBeAg-negative Participants With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05123599\nAmgen Inc. (Amgen)\nOn September 28, 2016, Amgen and the Company entered into two collaboration and license agreements and a common stock purchase agreement. Under the Second Collaboration and License Agreement (the Olpasiran Agreement), Amgen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Companys novel RNAi olpasiran (previously referred to as AMG 890 or ARO-LPA) program. These RNAi molecules are designed to reduce elevated lipoprotein(a), which is a genetically validated, independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Under the Olpasiran Agreement, Amgen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization.\nUnder the terms of the Olpasiran Agreement, the Company has received $35.0 million in upfront payments, $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Companys common stock, and $55.0 million in milestone payments. The Company has substantially completed its performance obligations under the Olpasiran Agreement.\nIn November 2022, Royalty Pharma Investments 2019 ICAV (Royalty Pharma) and the Company entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the Royalty Pharma Agreement). In consideration for the payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive up to an additional $535.0 million in remaining development, regulatory and sales milestone payments payable from Amgen and Royalty Pharma.\nOlpasiran\nOlpasiran is designed to reduce production of apolipoprotein A, a key component of lipoprotein(a), which has been genetically linked with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, independent of cholesterol and LDL levels. Amgen completed a Phase 2 clinical study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olpasiran in subjects with elevated levels of lipoprotein(a). Amgen reported Phase 2 clinical results at the American Heart Association (AHA) Scientific Sessions in November 2022 and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Amgen began evaluating olpasiran in a Phase 3 study to assess the impact of olpasiran on major cardiovascular events in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and elevated lipoprotein(a), in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi center study in December 2022, which triggered a $25 million milestone payment to the Company.\nClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: (NCT05581303)\nJoint Venture and License Agreement with Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Visirna)\nOn April 25, 2022, Visirna and the Company entered into a License Agreement (the Visirna License Agreement), pursuant to which Visirna received an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize four of the Companys RNAi-based investigational cardiometabolic medicines in Greater China (including the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan).

Please see Risk Factors in Part I, ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nThe Companys business involves various risks and uncertainties in addition to the normal risks of business, some of which are discussed in this section. It should be noted that the Companys business may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and other forces beyond the Companys control. In addition, other risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the Company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the Companys business. Any such risks or uncertainties, or any of the following risks or uncertainties, that develop into actual events could result in a material and adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.\nThe information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents and materials filed by the Company with the SEC, as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the Company from time to time.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Discovery, Development, and Commercialization of Medicines\nOur prospects substantially depend on the success of our clinical-stage product candidates. If we and our licensees are unable to obtain approval for and commercialize these product candidates, our business could be materially harmed.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize our new drugs, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use.\nOur product candidates are in clinical development, which is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the potential for substantial delays. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nOur clinical trials may not yield successful results for the product candidates that we may identify and pursue for their intended uses, which would prevent, delay or limit the scope of regulatory approval and commercialization.\nOur clinical trials may reveal significant adverse events, toxicities or other side effects and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our product candidates.\nResults of earlier studies or clinical trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies or clinical trials may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy profile for our product candidates to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Candidates\nA Fast Track product designation may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe and our licensees conduct clinical trials for product candidates outside the United States, and the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval for products in the United States, we may never obtain approval to commercialize any product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercialization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unanticipated problems with our products may result in various adverse actions such as the suspension or withdrawal of one or more of our products, closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial penalties or fines.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage.\nWe are party to technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and, if these agreements are terminated, our technology and our business could be seriously and adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims, which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products.\nWe may not be able to effectively secure first-tier technologies when competing against other companies or investors.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nOur business model assumes we will generate revenue by, among other activities, marketing or out-licensing the products we develop. Our drug candidates are in various stages of development and we have no approved products based on RNA interference and our delivery technologies. Accordingly, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe may need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop our drug candidates and market any approved products.\nOur ability to generate milestone and royalty payments under our current and potential future licensing and collaboration agreements is substantially controlled by our partners, and as such, we will likely need other sources of financing to continue to develop our internal drug candidates.\nWe may lose a considerable amount of control over our intellectual property and may not receive anticipated revenues in strategic transactions, particularly where the consideration is contingent on the achievement of development or sales milestones.\nWe will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our drug candidates to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nWe have limited manufacturing capability and must rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our clinical supplies and commercial products, if and when approved, and if they fail to meet their obligations, the development and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the development of our products may be adversely affected.\nWe face competition from various entities including large pharmaceutical companies, small biotech companies, private companies, and research institutions.\nWe may have difficulty expanding our operations successfully as we evolve our pipeline and move toward commercializing drugs.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operations, including our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers, are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, exposes us to liability for criminal sanctions, civil penalties, and contractual damages, and reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of net losses, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our accruals.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and fixed income securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits may be limited.\nRisks Related to Investment and Securities\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be limited, and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future, without regard to our results of operations and prospects.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nDrug development is time consuming, expensive and risky.\nThe healthcare system is under significant financial pressure to reduce costs, which could reduce payment and reimbursement rates for drugs.\nRegulatory standards are subject to change over time, making it difficult to accurately predict the likelihood of marketing approval even when clinical trials meet their endpoints.\nRisks Related to Our Discovery, Development, and Commercialization of Medicines\nOur prospects substantially depend on the success of our clinical-stage product candidates. If we and our licensees are unable to obtain approval for and commercialize these product candidates, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the ability of our company and our licensees to timely complete clinical trials and obtain marketing approval for, and then successfully commercialize our clinical-stage product candidates. We are not permitted to market or promote our product candidates before we receive marketing approval from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and we may never receive such marketing approvals.\nThe success of developing and commercializing our product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\nobtaining positive data that supports demonstration of efficacy, safety and tolerability profiles and durability of effect for our product candidates that are satisfactory to the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority for marketing approval;\nsuccessful and timely enrollment of appropriate patients for the indications included in our current and future clinical trials;\npotential variability of patient outcomes;\nthe extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments to applicable regulatory authorities;\nthe establishment of and maintenance of sufficient internal manufacturing capabilities;\nthe maintenance of existing or the establishment of new supply arrangements with third-party drug product suppliers and manufacturers for clinical development and, if approved, commercialization of our product candidates;\nthe maintenance of existing or the establishment of new scaled production arrangements with third-party manufacturers to obtain finished products that are appropriately packaged for sale;\nobtaining and maintaining patent protection, trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity, both in the United States and internationally;\nprotecting our rights in our intellectual property portfolio, including our licensed intellectual property;\nestablishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities and the successful launch of commercial sales of our product candidates if and when approved for marketing, whether alone or in collaboration with others;\na continued acceptable safety profile following any marketing approval;\ncommercial acceptance by patients, the medical community and third-party payors; and\nour ability to compete with other therapies.\nWe do not have complete control over many of these factors, including certain aspects of clinical development and the regulatory submission process, potential threats to our intellectual property rights and the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sales efforts of any collaborator or licensee. For development programs that are licensed to third parties, we generally do not have control over the design or conduct of clinical trials and will not have discretion over marketing decisions. If we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize any product candidates from our lead programs, which would materially harm our business. If we do not receive marketing approvals for such product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nThere are substantial risks inherent in attempting to commercialize our new drugs, and, as a result, we may not be able to successfully develop products for commercial use.\nScientific research and development requires significant amounts of capital and takes a long time to reach commercial viability if it can be achieved at all. To date, our research and development projects have not produced commercially viable drugs and may never do so. During the research and development process, we may experience technological barriers that we may be unable to overcome. Because we use platform technology to develop drug candidates, toxicology signals that may emerge in the course of testing of one particular candidate may apply broadly across our drug candidate platform. Further, certain underlying premises in our development programs are not proven and many of the drug targets that we are pursuing have not yet been validated clinically. For instance, ARO-RAGE has demonstrated the ability to reduce the expression of RAGE in the lung, however it has not been established that this will have an anti-inflammatory effect sufficient for a meaningful clinical benefit in patients with inflammatory lung disease. Further, it is also unknown at this time what may be required to gain favorable reimbursement. With respect to fazirsiran, it is also unknown at this time what changes in the liver may be required to gain regulatory approval and/or favorable reimbursement for a drug that reduces the production of mutant alpha-1 antitrypsin in the liver. Similar uncertainties and risks exist that are specific to each of our development programs. Because of these and similar uncertainties, it is possible that no commercial products will be successfully developed. If we are unable to successfully develop commercial products, we will be unable to generate revenue or build a sustainable or profitable business.\nOur product candidates are in clinical development, which is a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes and the potential for substantial delays. There can be no assurance that our product candidates will obtain regulatory approval, which is necessary before they can be commercialized.\nThe sale of human therapeutic products in the United States and foreign jurisdictions is subject to extensive and time-consuming regulatory approval which requires, among other things:\ncontrolled research and human clinical testing;\nestablishment of the safety and efficacy of the product;\ngovernment review and approval of a submission containing manufacturing, preclinical and clinical data; and\nadherence to cGMP regulations during production and storage.\nSince 2011, we have focused substantially all of our efforts and financial resources on identifying, acquiring and developing our product candidates, including conducting lead optimization, nonclinical studies, preclinical studies and clinical trials, and providing general administrative support for these operations. And, the clinical-stage product candidates we currently have under development will require significant development, preclinical and clinical testing and investment of significant funds to gain regulatory approval before they can be approved for commercialization. The results of our research and human clinical testing of our products may not meet regulatory requirements. Some of our product candidates, if approved, may require the completion of post-market studies. There can be no assurance that any of our products will be further developed and approved. The process of completing clinical testing and obtaining required approvals will take several years and require the use of substantial resources. For instance, we currently plan to study plozasiran in a cardiovascular outcomes trial, and cardiovascular outcomes trials are expensive clinical trials performed in a large number of subjects over several years. Further, there can be no assurance that product candidates employing a new technology will be shown to be safe and effective in clinical trials or receive applicable regulatory approvals. If we fail to obtain regulatory approvals for any or all of our products, we will not be able to market such product and our operations may be adversely affected.\nOur clinical trials may not yield successful results for the product candidates that we may identify and pursue for their intended uses, which would prevent, delay or limit the scope of regulatory approval and commercialization.\nWe must demonstrate our product candidates safety and efficacy in humans for each target indication through extensive clinical testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of any products, including the following:\nthe results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive, or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials;\nsafety and efficacy results attained in early human clinical trials may not be indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials;\nafter reviewing test results, we may abandon projects that we might previously have believed to be promising;\nwe or our regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials because the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks; and\nour product candidates may not have the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved.\nWe cannot be certain that current clinical trials or any future clinical trials, whether conducted by us or our licensees, will be successful. Additionally, any safety concerns observed in any one of our clinical trials in our targeted indications could limit the prospects for regulatory approval of our product candidates in those and other indications, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. Success in clinical trials in a particular indication does not ensure that a product candidate will be successful in other indications. Similarly, approval of a product candidate in a particular indication does not ensure that the product candidate will be successful in other indications. For instance, even if plozasiran's Phase 3 trial for patients with FCS is successful in achieving its endpoints and a regulatory authority approves plozasiran for the treatment of FCS, plozasiran may not succeed in achieving its clinical trial endpoints or be approved for the treatment of larger indications such as sHTG or ASCVD because the endpoints and clinical data required for approval in a rare disease indication are different from what is required for a broader patient population. Moreover, results acceptable to support approval in one jurisdiction may be deemed inadequate by another regulatory authority to support regulatory approval in that other jurisdiction. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, we may be required to expend significant resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates. Even if regulatory approval is secured for a product candidate, the terms of such approval may limit the scope and use of the specific product candidate, which may also limit its commercial potential.\nOur clinical trials may reveal significant adverse events, toxicities or other side effects and may result in a safety profile that could inhibit regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our product candidates.\nIn order to obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the relevant clinical indication or indications through preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as additional supporting data. As is the case with pharmaceuticals generally, it is likely that there may be side effects and adverse events (AEs) associated with the use of our products or product candidates. If our product candidates are associated with undesirable side effects in preclinical studies or clinical trials, or have unexpected characteristics, we may need to interrupt, delay or abandon their development or limit development to more narrow uses or subpopulations in which the undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective.\nIf further significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials, we may have difficulty recruiting patients to the clinical trials, patients may drop out of our trials, or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of that product candidate altogether. We, the FDA, the EMA, other applicable regulatory authorities or an institutional review board may suspend clinical trials of a product candidate at any time for various reasons, including a belief that subjects in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects. Some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in early-stage studies have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development. Even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval, undesirable side effects may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability relative to other therapies. Any of these developments could materially harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nClinical trials of our product candidates may not uncover all possible adverse events that patients may experience.\nClinical trials are conducted in representative samples of the potential patient population, which may have significant variability. By design, clinical trials are based on a limited number of subjects and are of limited duration of exposure to the product, to determine whether the product candidate demonstrates the substantial evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval. As with the results of any statistical sampling, we cannot be sure that all side effects of our product candidates may be uncovered. It may be the case that only with a significantly larger number of patients exposed to the product candidate for a longer duration may a more complete safety profile be identified. Further, even larger clinical trials may not identify rare significant AEs, and the duration of such studies may not be sufficient to identify when those events may occur. Other products have been approved by the regulatory authorities for which safety concerns have been uncovered following approval. Such safety concerns have led to labeling changes, restrictions on distribution through use of a REMS, or withdrawal of products from the market, and any of our product candidates may be subject to similar risks.\nAlthough to date our current drug candidates have generally evidenced an acceptable safety profile in clinical trials, patients treated with our products, if approved, may experience previously unreported adverse reactions or minor incidences of adverse reactions may manifest with greater frequency in subsequent larger trials, and it is possible that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may ask for additional safety data as a condition of, or in connection with, our efforts to obtain approval of our product candidates. If toxicities, adverse events or any other safety problems occur or are identified after our products, if any, reach the market, we may make the decision or be required by regulatory authorities to conduct additional clinical safety trials, amend the labeling of our products or add additional warnings to the labeling, recall our products, or even withdraw approval for our products.\nTopline data may not accurately reflect the complete results of a particular study or trial.\nWe may publicly disclose topline or interim data from time to time, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available efficacy and safety data which are based on preliminary analysis of key efficacy and safety data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the data related to the particular study or trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the topline results that we report may differ from future results of the same studies, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Topline data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, topline data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular drug candidate or drug and our company in general. In addition, the information we may publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material\nor otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, drug candidate or our business. If the topline data that we report differ from a future analysis of results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.\nResults of earlier studies or clinical trials may not be predictive of future clinical trial results, and initial studies or clinical trials may not establish an adequate safety or efficacy profile for our product candidates to justify proceeding to advanced clinical trials or an application for regulatory approval.\nThe results of nonclinical and preclinical studies and clinical trials may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials, and interim results of clinical trials do not necessarily predict final results. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials in one set of patients or disease indications, or from preclinical studies or clinical trials that we did not lead, may not be predictive of those obtained in another. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the dosing regimen and other clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. In addition, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to various interpretations and analyses, and many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development, or after achieving positive results in pivotal trials, and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even if early-stage clinical trials are successful, we may need to conduct additional clinical trials of our product candidates in additional patient populations or under different treatment conditions before we are able to seek approvals from the FDA and regulatory authorities outside the United States to market and sell these product candidates. Our failure to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates for commercially viable indications, or at all, would substantially harm our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIt may take us longer than we project to complete clinical trials, and we may not be able to complete them at all.\nAlthough for planning purposes we project the commencement, continuation and completion of our clinical trials, a number of factors, including scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions, and difficulties in identifying or enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria, may cause significant delays. Enrollment of clinical trials may be particularly difficult in orphan diseases or limited-sized patient populations. The FDA or other regulatory bodies may require additional, longer or broader clinical trials to establish safety and effectiveness, notwithstanding guidance the Company may have received from those bodies during clinical trial planning and execution. Further, the cost for conducting clinical trials is significant and if our cash resources become limited we may not be able to commence, continue and/or complete our clinical trials. We may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our product candidates as projected or may not conduct them successfully.\nWe face potential product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability for a product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization.\nThe use of our product candidates in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval expose us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by clinical trial participants, consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, or others selling our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against these claims, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcomes of such claims, product liability claims may result in:\ndecreased demand for our product candidates;\nimpairment of our business reputation;\nwithdrawal of clinical trial participants;\ncosts of litigation;\nsubstantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants; and\nloss of revenues.\nOur insurance coverage may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which government authorities and health insurers establish adequate reimbursement levels and pricing policies.\nSales of any approved drug candidate will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers such as government insurance programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other health care related organizations, who are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. Accordingly, coverage and reimbursement may be uncertain. Adoption of any drug by the medical community may be limited if third-party payers will not offer adequate coverage. Additionally, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly-approved drugs. Cost control initiatives may decrease coverage and payment levels for any drug and, in turn, the price that we will be able to charge and/or the volume of our sales. We are unable to predict all changes to the coverage or reimbursement methodologies that will be applied by private or government payers. Any denial of private or government payer coverage or inadequate reimbursement could harm our business and reduce our revenue. With respect to our partnered product candidates, we will be reliant on that partner to obtain reimbursement from government and private payors for the drug, if approved, and any failure of that partner to establish adequate reimbursement could have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation, regulations, and policies affecting coverage and reimbursement rates, which are designed to contain or reduce the cost of health care. Further federal and state proposals and healthcare reforms are likely, which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunity. For example, the IRA includes several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms, including limits on price increases and subjecting an escalating number of drugs to annual price negotiations with CMS (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services). We cannot be sure whether additional legislation or rulemaking related to the IRA will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future. There also may be future changes unrelated to the IRA that result in reductions in potential coverage and reimbursement levels for our product candidates, if approved and commercialized, and we cannot predict the scope of any future changes or the impact that those changes would have on our operations.\nIf future reimbursement for approved product candidates, if any, is substantially less than we project, or rebate obligations associated with them are substantially greater than we expect, our future net revenue and profitability could be materially diminished.\nWe may not enjoy the market exclusivity benefits of our orphan drug designations.\nAlthough we may obtain orphan designations in the treatment of certain diseases our products are intended to treat, the designation may not be applicable to any particular product we might get approved and that product may not be the first product to receive approval for that indication. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the first product with an orphan designation receives market exclusivity, which prohibits the FDA from approving the same drug for the same indication. The FDA has stated that drugs can be the same even when they are not identical but has not provided guidance with respect to how it will determine sameness for RNAi drugs. It is possible that another RNAi drug could be approved for the treatment of a disease that one of our orphan products is intended to treat before our product is approved, which means that we may not obtain orphan drug exclusivity and could also potentially be blocked from approval until the first products orphan drug exclusivity period expires or we demonstrate, if we can, that our product is superior. Further, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved and granted orphan drug exclusivity, the FDA can subsequently approve the same drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Further, orphan drug exclusivity can be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the applicant is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated.\nOur success depends on the attraction and retention of senior management and scientists with relevant expertise.\nOur future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees, including our senior scientific, technical and managerial personnel. We do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our executives and we do not maintain employment agreements with many senior employees. Competition for qualified employees in the pharmaceutical industry is high, and our ability to execute our strategy will depend in part on our ability to continue to attract and retain qualified scientists, management and other employees. This will depend in part on our ability to create and maintain a desirable workplace culture, which may be impacted by employee preferences for remote working. In addition, the market for qualified employees in the pharmaceutical industry is experiencing labor shortages and inflationary pressures are causing salaries and wages to increase, all of which exacerbates these competitive dynamics. If\nwe are unable to find, hire and retain qualified individuals, we will have difficulty implementing our business plan in a timely manner, or at all.\nRisks Related to Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Product Candidates\nBreakthrough Therapy designation for Fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT) may not lead to a faster development or review process.\nWe have been granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation for fazirsiran in the United States for the treatment of liver disease associated with AATD. Breakthrough Therapy designation is intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of new therapies to treat serious conditions with unmet medical needs by providing sponsors with the opportunity for frequent interactions and additional drug development guidance with the FDA and its senior managers. Breakthrough Therapy designation applies to the combination of the drug candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Product candidates that receive Breakthrough Therapy designation may receive more frequent interactions with the FDA regarding the product candidates development plan and clinical trials and may be eligible for the FDAs Rolling Review.\nDespite receiving Breakthrough Therapy designation, fazirsiran may not actually benefit from faster clinical development or regulatory review or approval any sooner than other product candidates that do not have such designation, or at all. Furthermore, such a designation does not increase the likelihood that fazirsiran will receive marketing approval in the United States. The FDA may also rescind Breakthrough Therapy designation if it determines that fazirsiran no longer meets the relevant criteria.\nA Fast Track product designation may not lead to faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it does not increase the likelihood that our product candidates will receive marketing approval.\nWe have received a Fast Track product designation for plozasiran in the United States for the treatment of FCS, and we may seek Fast Track designation for other of our current or future product candidates. The Fast Track designation is a program offered by the FDA designed to facilitate drug development and to expedite the review of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions. Compounds selected must demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The FDAs Fast Track designation allows for close and frequent interaction with the FDA. A designated Fast Track drug may also be considered for priority review with a shortened review time, rolling submission, and accelerated approval if applicable.\nA Fast Track designation does not, however, guarantee FDA approval or expedited approval of any application for the product candidate. The receipt of such a designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate marketing approval by the FDA. In addition, the FDA may later decide that the products no longer meet the designation conditions.\nWe intend to deliver some of our product candidates via drug delivery devices that will have their own regulatory, development, supply and other risks.\nWe intend to deliver some of our product candidates via drug delivery devices, such as an autoinjector or nebulizer. There may be unforeseen technical complications related to the development activities required to bring such a product to market, including container compatibility and/or dose volume requirements. Our product candidates may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving approval if the devices do not gain and/or maintain their own regulatory approvals or clearances. Where approval of the drug product and device is sought under a single application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay approval. In addition, some drug delivery devices are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We may be dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies both to supply the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or other regulatory clearance of the devices. Even if approval is obtained, we may also be dependent on those third-party companies continuing to maintain such approvals or clearances once they have been received. Failure of third-party companies to supply the devices, to successfully complete studies on the devices in a timely manner, or to obtain or maintain required approvals or clearances of the devices could result in increased development costs, delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval and delays in product candidates reaching the market or in gaining approval or clearance for expanded labels for new indications.\nWe and our licensees conduct clinical trials for product candidates outside the United States, and the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.\nWe and our licensees currently conduct clinical trials outside the United States. The acceptance by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authority of study data from clinical trials conducted outside the United States or another\njurisdiction may be subject to certain conditions or may not be accepted at all. In cases where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will generally not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless (i) the data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (ii) the trials were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence and pursuant to GCP regulations; and (iii) the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such as inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Additionally, the FDAs clinical trial requirements, including sufficient size of patient populations and statistical powering, must be met. Many foreign regulatory authorities have similar approval requirements. In addition, such foreign trials would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the trials are conducted. There can be no assurance that the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable jurisdiction. Most of our clinical trials involve study subjects outside of the United States, including most of our phase 1 clinical trials (which often enroll study subjects in Australia and New Zealand), and our Phase 3 clinical trials of plozasiran, for which we have enrolled (with respect to FCS) and plan to enroll (with respect to sHTG and ASCVD) cohorts outside the United States. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of our business plan, and which may result in product candidates that we may develop not receiving approval or clearance for commercialization in the applicable jurisdiction.\nEven if we obtain FDA approval for products in the United States, we may never obtain approval to commercialize any product candidates outside of the United States, which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential.\nIn order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and effectiveness. Clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not mean that regulatory approval will be obtained in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional or different administrative review periods from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval before a product can be marketed in that jurisdiction, even after establishing safety and efficacy in a clinical setting.\nSeeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs and require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time-consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in those countries. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approval in international markets is delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be harmed.\nEven if our product candidates are approved for commercialization, failure to comply with regulatory requirements or unanticipated problems with our products may result in various adverse actions such as the suspension or withdrawal of one or more of our products, closure of a facility or enforcement of substantial penalties or fines.\nIf regulatory approval to sell any of our product candidates is received, regulatory agencies will subject any marketed product(s) and the facilities where they are manufactured to continual review and periodic inspection. If previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturing and laboratory facilities or regulatory requirements are discovered, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with a manufacturing process or laboratory facility, or failure to comply with applicable regulatory approval requirements, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions or penalties on that product or on us. Such restrictions or penalties may include, among other things:\nrestrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, the withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;\nwarning letters or holds on clinical trials;\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or suspension or revocation of approvals;\nproduct seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of our product candidates; and\nclosure of the facility, enforcement of substantial fines, injunctions, or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights is uncertain, exposing us to the possible loss of competitive advantage.\nWe have licensed rights to patents and have filed and expect to continue to file patent applications. Researchers sponsored by us may also file patent applications that we may need to license. Such patent applications may not be available for licensing or may not be economically feasible to license. Certain of our patents may not be granted or may not contain claims of the necessary breadth because, for example, prior patents exist. If a particular patent is not granted, the value of the invention described in the patent would be diminished. Further, even if these patents are granted, they may be difficult to enforce. Even if ultimately successful, efforts to enforce our patent rights could be expensive, distracting for management, cause our patents to be invalidated or held unenforceable, and thus frustrate commercialization of products. Even if patents are issued and are enforceable, others may develop similar, superior or parallel technologies to any technology developed by us and not infringe on our patents. Our technology may prove to infringe upon patents or rights owned by others. Patent prosecution and maintenance is expensive, and we may be forced to curtail prosecution or maintenance if our cash resources are limited. Thus, the patents held by or licensed to us may not afford us any meaningful competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we do business, including through our joint ventures, do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. Moreover, if we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates or technologies, including as a result of geopolitical events such as civil or political unrest (including the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine and Russia and Israel and Palestine), we may not be able to use such patents and patent applications or stop a competitor from marketing products that are the same as or similar to our product candidates. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property both in the United States and abroad. If we are unable to adequately protect our owned intellectual property or derive sufficient value from our licensed or owned intellectual property, the value of your investment may decline.\nIn addition, patent grant standards by the USPTO and its foreign counterparts are not always uniform or predictable, and subject to change. For example, the America Invents Act enacted a number of changes to U.S. patent laws, which may prevent us from adequately protecting our inventions and discoveries, including our ability to seek injunctive relief, pursue infringement claims, and obtain substantial damage awards. An example of a major provision of the America Invents Act is the change in the U.S. patent policy from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file practice. Foreign counterparts to this law are also not uniform, and there is no worldwide policy governing the subject matter and scope of claims granted in a pharmaceutical or biotechnology patent. Uncertainty, arising from changing laws, can impact our ability to protect our patents and other proprietary rights.\nWe are party to technology license agreements with third parties that require us to satisfy obligations to keep them effective and, if these agreements are terminated, our technology and our business could be seriously and adversely affected.\nWe are party to license agreements to incorporate third-party proprietary technologies into our drug products under development. These license agreements require us to pay royalties and satisfy other conditions. If we fail to satisfy our obligations under these agreements, the terms of the licenses may be materially modified, such as by rendering currently exclusive licenses non-exclusive, or may give our licensors the right to terminate their respective agreement with us, which could limit our ability to implement our current business plan and harm our business and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to patent infringement claims, which could result in substantial costs and liability and prevent us from commercializing our potential products.\nBecause the intellectual property landscape in the fields in which we participate is rapidly evolving and interdisciplinary, it is difficult to conclusively assess our freedom to operate without infringing on third-party rights. However, if granted marketing approval, we are currently aware of certain patent rights held by third parties that, if found to be valid and enforceable, could be alleged to render one or more of our drug candidates infringing. If a claim should be brought and is successful, we may be required to pay substantial damages, be forced to abandon any affected drug candidates and/or seek a license from the patent holder. In addition, any patent infringement claims brought against us, whether or not successful, may cause us to incur significant expenses and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from other business concerns. These could negatively affect our results of operations and prospects. We cannot be certain that patents owned or licensed by us will not be challenged, potentially successfully, by others.\nIn addition, if our product candidates are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, these third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers, licensees and other parties with whom we have business relationships, and we may be required to indemnify those parties for any damages they suffer as a result of these claims. The claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of customers, licensees, and other\nparties regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of those parties or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, we may be unable to continue selling such products.\nWe license patent rights from third-party owners and we rely on such owners to obtain, maintain and enforce the patents underlying such licenses.\nWe are a party to a number of licenses that give us rights to third-party intellectual property that is necessary or useful for our business. We also expect to enter into additional licenses to third-party intellectual property in the future.\nOur success may depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed intellectual property, in particular, those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights. Our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents are issued in respect of these patent applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the intellectual property we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects.\nOur technology licensed from various third parties may be subject to retained rights.\nOur licensors often retain certain rights under their agreements with us, including the right to use the underlying technology for noncommercial academic and research use, to publish general scientific findings from research related to the technology, and to make customary scientific and scholarly disclosures of information relating to the technology. It is difficult to monitor whether our licensors limit their use of the technology to these uses, and we could incur substantial expenses to enforce our rights to our licensed technology in the event of misuse.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information.\nIn order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. As our organization grows, so does the risk of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, while we undertake efforts to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information from disclosure, others may independently discover trade secrets and proprietary information, and in such cases, we may not be able to assert any trade secret rights against such party. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights, and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nWe may not be able to effectively secure first-tier technologies when competing against other companies or investors.\nOur future success may require that we acquire patent rights and know-how to new or complimentary technologies. However, we also compete with a substantial number of other companies that are working to develop novel drugs using technology that compete directly with us. We are aware of several other companies that are working to develop RNAi therapeutic products and any one of these companies may develop its RNAi technology more rapidly and more effectively than us] may also compete for technologies we desire. In addition, many venture capital firms and other institutional investors, as well as other pharmaceutical and biotech companies, invest in companies seeking to commercialize various types of emerging technologies. Many of these companies have greater financial, scientific and commercial resources than us. Therefore, we may not be able to secure the technologies we desire or to otherwise effectively compete. Furthermore, should any commercial undertaking by us prove to be successful, there can be no assurance competitors with greater financial resources will not offer competitive products and/or technologies.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world, which could negatively impact our business.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents covering our current and any future product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we or our licensors have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we may obtain patent protection but where patent enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products in jurisdictions where we do not have any issued or licensed patents, and any future patent claims or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. Issued patents may be challenged by third parties in the courts or patent offices in various countries throughout the world. Invalidation proceedings may result in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held\nunenforceable. Uncertainties regarding the outcome of such proceedings, as well as any resulting losses of patent protection, could harm our business.\nMany countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. Some countries do not enforce patents related to medical treatments, or limit enforceability in the case of a public emergency. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nThe intellectual property systems in other countries can be destabilized or unpredictable as a result of geopolitical events such as civil or political unrest (including the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine and Russia and Israel and Palestine). Therefore, during such geopolitical events, the ability to obtain, retain and enforce intellectual property protection in the affected countries may be uncertain and evolve during the course of such geopolitical event. The U.S. governments response to geopolitical events may also negatively affect our ability to obtain, retain and enforce intellectual property protection in the affected countries. Uncertainties regarding geopolitical events, as well as any resulting losses of intellectual property protection, could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business Model\nOur business model assumes we will generate revenue by, among other activities, marketing or out-licensing the products we develop. Our drug candidates are in various stages of development and we have no approved products based on RNA interference and our delivery technologies. Accordingly, there is a limited amount of information about us upon which you can evaluate our business and prospects.\nWe have no approved drugs and thus have not begun to market or generate revenues from the commercialization of any product candidates. Because no drug candidates generated with our product platform have been approved, we have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully overcome many of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving fields, particularly in the biopharmaceutical area. For example, to execute our business plan, we will need to successfully:\nExecute product development activities using technologies that have not yet generated an approved product;\nBuild, maintain, and protect a strong intellectual property portfolio;\nDemonstrate safety and efficacy of our drug candidates in multiple human clinical studies;\nReceive FDA approval and approval from similar foreign regulatory bodies;\nGain market acceptance for the development and commercialization of any drugs we develop;\nEnsure our products are reimbursed by commercial and/or government payors at a rate that permits commercial viability;\nDevelop and maintain successful strategic relationships with suppliers, distributors, and commercial licensing partners;\nManage our spending and cash requirements as our expenses will increase in the near term if we add programs and additional preclinical and clinical trials; and\nEffectively market any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIf we are unsuccessful in accomplishing these objectives, we may not be able to develop products, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.\nWe may need to establish additional relationships with strategic and development partners to fully develop our drug candidates and market any approved products.\nOver the past several years we have entered into license and collaboration agreements with Takeda, Janssen, Amgen, Horizon, GSK and Visirna. Our business strategy includes securing additional collaborations with other pharmaceutical and biotech companies to support the development of our RNAi therapeutics and other drug candidates. We do not possess all of the financial and development resources necessary to develop and commercialize all of the products that may result from our technologies. Unless we expand our product development capacity and enhance our internal marketing capability, we may need to make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to develop and commercialize any drug candidates that may be approved. We may not be able to attract such partners, and even if we are able to enter into such partnerships, the terms may be less favorable than anticipated. Further, entering into partnership agreements may limit our commercialization options and/or require us to share revenues and profits with our partners. If we do not find appropriate partners, or if our existing arrangements or future agreements are not successful, our ability to develop and commercialize products could be adversely affected. Even if we are able to find collaborative partners, the overall success\nof the development and commercialization of product candidates in those programs will depend largely on the efforts of other parties and will be beyond our control, particularly as partnered programs progress and our licensees may elect to assume greater control over these programs. In addition, in the event we pursue our commercialization strategy through collaboration or licenses to third parties, there are a variety of technical, business and legal risks, including:\nWe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may be willing or able to devote to the development or commercialization of our drug candidates or to their marketing and distribution; and\nDisputes may arise between us and our collaborators that result in the delay or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our managements resources.\nThe occurrence of any of the above events or other related events could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to generate milestone and royalty payments under our current and potential future licensing and collaboration agreements is substantially controlled by our partners, and as such, we will likely need other sources of financing to continue to develop our internal drug candidates.\nUnder our licensing and collaboration agreements with Amgen, Janssen, Takeda, Horizon, GSK and Visirna, our partners substantially control clinical development and commercialization for all of the candidates covered under those agreements in their relevant territories. To the extent that (i) our partners interests in advancing these candidates or targets changes, (ii) unforeseen scientific issues with the candidates arise, or (iii) the pace at which our partners move the candidates through clinical trials toward commercialization slows, our ability to collect milestones and royalties may be significantly diminished. This would further cause us to rely upon other sources of financing to continue to develop our other internal drug candidates.\nWe may lose a considerable amount of control over our intellectual property and may not receive anticipated revenues in strategic transactions, particularly where the consideration is contingent on the achievement of development or sales milestones.\nOur business model has been to develop new technologies and to utilize the intellectual property created through the research and development process to develop commercially successful products. If the acquirers of our technologies fail to achieve performance milestones, we may not receive a significant portion of the total value of any sale, license or other strategic transaction.\nWe will need to achieve commercial acceptance of our drug candidates to generate revenues and achieve profitability.\nEven if our research and development efforts yield technologically feasible applications, we may not successfully develop commercial products. Drug development takes years of study in human clinical trials prior to regulatory approval, and, even if we are successful in getting regulatory approval of our drug candidates, it may not be on a timely basis. During our drug development period, superior competitive technologies may be introduced which could diminish or extinguish the potential commercial uses for our drug candidates. Additionally, the degree to which the medical community and consumers will adopt any product we develop is uncertain. The rate and degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on a number of factors, including the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the clinical efficacy and safety of our products, their potential advantage over alternative treatments, and the costs to patients and third-party payors, including insurance companies and Medicare. Recent efforts in the United States and abroad to reduce overall healthcare spending has put significant pressure on the price of prescription drugs and certain companies have been publicly criticized for the relatively high cost of their therapies. These pressures may force us to sell any approved drugs at a lower price than we or analysts may anticipate or may result in lower levels of reimbursement and coverage from third parties.\nWe cannot predict whether significant commercial market acceptance for our products, if approved, will ever develop, and we cannot reliably estimate the projected size of any such potential market. Our revenue growth and achievement of consistent profitability will depend substantially on our ability to introduce products that will be accepted by the medical community. If we are unable to cost-effectively achieve acceptance of our technology among the medical establishment and patients, or if the associated products do not achieve wide market acceptance, our business will be materially and adversely affected.\nWe rely on outside sources for various components and processes for our products.\nWe rely on third parties for various components and processes for our product candidates. We may not be able to achieve multiple sourcing because there may be no acceptable second source, other companies may choose not to work with us, or the component or process sought may be so new that a second source does not exist or does not exist on acceptable terms. For instance, many of our pulmonary drug candidates are administered using a proprietary delivery\ndevice which can only be sourced from a single manufacturer. There may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our third-party contractors, suppliers or collaborators which is beyond our control. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their commitments to us, the development of our products would be adversely affected. Therefore, it is possible that our development plans will have to be slowed down or stopped completely at times due to our inability to obtain required raw materials, components, and outsourced processes at an acceptable cost, if at all, or to get a timely response from vendors, particularly as a result of recent labor market and global supply chain constraints.\nWe have limited manufacturing capability and must rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture our clinical supplies and commercial products, if and when approved, and if they fail to meet their obligations, the development and commercialization of our products could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we are currently in the process of further developing our own internal manufacturing capabilities, we have limited internal manufacturing capabilities and we rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third-party manufacturers for the production of some of our product candidates for clinical trials and potential future commercialization. If we were to experience an unexpected loss or interruption of supply for any of our product candidates, whether as a result of manufacturing, supply or storage issues or otherwise, we could experience delays, disruptions, suspensions or terminations of, or be required to restart or repeat, any pending or ongoing clinical trials. Further, our drug candidates are composed of multiple components and require specialized formulations for which scale-up and manufacturing could be difficult. We have limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing requiring us to depend on a limited number of third parties, who may not be able to deliver in a timely manner, or at all. In order to develop products, apply for regulatory approvals, and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. Our internal GMP manufacturing capabilities are currently limited to small-scale production of material, although we anticipate an increase in our GMP manufacturing capacity following the successful completion and integration of our manufacturing facility in Verona, Wisconsin. There are a limited number of manufacturers that supply synthetic oligonucleotides. There are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of our or our contract manufacturers to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of material to meet our needs. Included in these risks are synthesis and purification failures and contamination during the manufacturing process, which could result in unusable product and cause delays in our development process, as well as additional expense to us.\nAdditionally, our product candidates have not yet been manufactured for commercial use. If any of our product candidates become approved for commercial sale, we will need to establish either internal or third-party manufacturing capacity. Manufacturing partner requirements may require us to fund capital improvements, perhaps on behalf of third parties, to support the scale-up of manufacturing and related activities. We may not be able to establish scaled manufacturing capacity for an approved product in a timely or economic manner, if at all. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to provide commercial quantities of such an approved product, we will have to successfully transfer manufacturing technology to a different manufacturer. Engaging a new manufacturer for such an approved product could require us to conduct comparative studies or utilize other means to determine bioequivalence of the new and prior manufacturers products, which could delay or prevent our ability to commercialize such an approved product. If we or any of these manufacturers is unable or unwilling to increase its manufacturing capacity or if we are unable to establish alternative arrangements on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, the development and commercialization of such an approved product may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Any inability to manufacture our product candidates or future approved drugs in sufficient quantities when needed would seriously harm our business. While we are exploring alternative suppliers for certain critical materials, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful.\nIf any of our drug candidates is approved by a regulatory authority, manufacturers of our approved products (including us, if we chose to internally manufacture) must comply with cGMP requirements relating to methods, facilities and controls used in the manufacturing, processing and packaging of the product, which are intended to ensure that drug products are safe and that they consistently meet applicable requirements and specifications. These requirements include quality control, quality assurance, and the maintenance of records and documentation. These manufacturers (including us, if we chose to internally manufacture) may be unable to comply with these cGMP requirements and with other FDA, state and foreign regulatory requirements. These requirements are enforced by the FDA and other health authorities through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing facilities. A failure to comply with these requirements or to provide adequate and timely corrective actions in response to deficiencies identified in an inspection may result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, plant shutdown, or the delay, withholding, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of any quantities supplied is compromised due to a manufacturers failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our products, which would seriously harm our business.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, and if they fail to fulfill their obligations, the development of our products may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations and other third-party service providers to assist us in managing, monitoring and otherwise carrying out our clinical trials. We contract with certain third-parties to provide certain services, including site selection, enrollment, monitoring and data management services. We rely on these parties to carry out our clinical trials in compliance with GCP and other relevant requirements. Although we depend heavily on these parties, we do not control them and therefore we cannot be assured that these third parties will adequately perform all of their contractual obligations to us. If our third-party service providers cannot adequately and timely fulfill their obligations to us, or if the quality and accuracy of our clinical trial data is compromised due to failure by such third parties to adhere to our protocols, GCP, or other regulatory requirements or if such third parties otherwise fail to meet deadlines or quality requirements, our development plans may be delayed or terminated. Further, if clinical study results are compromised, then we may need to repeat the affected studies, which could result in significant additional costs and delays to us.\nWe face competition from various entities including large pharmaceutical companies, small biotech companies, private companies, and research institutions.\nMany of our competitors have greater financial resources and may have more experience in research and development, manufacturing, managing clinical trials and/or regulatory compliance than we do. Our competitors may compete with us for lead clinical trial investigators, clinical trial site locations and patient enrollment. These competitors may also compete with us on recruiting scientific and management personnel. Because our products are in various stages of preclinical and clinical development, along with many of the competing products, and given unpredictability inherent in drug development, it is difficult to predict which third parties may provide the most competition, and on what specific basis that competition may be based.\nWe may have difficulty expanding our operations successfully as we evolve our pipeline and move toward commercializing drugs.\nOur future financial performance and our ability to commercialize products and compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively manage future growth. We expect that as we increase the number of product candidates we are developing we will also need to expand our operations. This expected growth may place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and information technology systems. As product candidates we develop enter and advance through clinical trials, we will need to expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, marketing, and sales capabilities or contract with other organizations to provide these capabilities for us. We are currently planning to establish a sales and marketing infrastructure, although we have no institutional experience in the sale, marketing, or distribution of pharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product for which we retain sales and marketing rights, we must continue to develop a sales and marketing organization or outsource these functions to third parties. If we or our collaborators are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into or maintain agreements with third parties to market and sell our product candidates, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved. Further, as our operations expand due to our development progress, we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborators, suppliers, and other organizations. Our ability to manage our operations and future growth will require us to continue to improve our operational, financial, information technology and management controls, reporting systems and procedures. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or implement improvements to our management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls.\nOur business and operations could suffer in the event of information technology system failures.\nOur internal computer systems and those of our contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, ransomware and other cyber-attacks, human error, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Such events could cause interruption of our operations and loss of intellectual property. For example, the loss of preclinical trial data or data from completed or ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates could result in delays in our regulatory filings and development efforts and significantly increase our costs. Further, cybersecurity breaches may allow hackers access to our preclinical compounds, strategies, discoveries, trade secrets, and/or other confidential information. Additionally, sensitive data could be leaked, disclosed, or revealed as a result of or in connection with our employees, personnels, vendors or partners use of generative AI technologies. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or private information, we could incur liability or regulatory penalties, including under laws and regulations governing the protection of health and other personally identifiable information, we could lose valuable trade secret rights, the development of our product candidates could be delayed, and we could suffer reputational damage and damage to key business relationships. The risk of a cyber-security breach or other informational technology disruption,\nparticularly through cyber-attacks, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. We have experienced cyber-security attacks in the past, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations or development programs; however; there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future.\nBecause we use biological materials, hazardous materials, chemicals and radioactive compounds, if we do not comply with laws regulating the protection of the environment and health and human safety, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur research, development and manufacturing activities involve the use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds that could be hazardous to human health and safety or the environment. We store most of these materials and various wastes resulting from their use at our facilities in Madison, Wisconsin and San Diego, California pending ultimate use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause interruption to our research and development and manufacturing efforts, injury to our employees and others, environmental damage, and liabilities under federal, state and local law. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Although we carry insurance in amounts and types that we consider commercially reasonable, we do not have insurance coverage for losses relating to an interruption of our research, development or manufacturing efforts caused by contamination, and the coverage or coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate. If our losses exceed our insurance coverage, our financial condition would be affected.\nLitigation claims may result in financial losses or harm our reputation and may divert management resources.\nWhen the market price of a stock is volatile, holders of that stock have often initiated securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. We cannot predict with certainty the eventual outcome of such litigation, arbitration or third-party inquiry. We may not be successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights in current or future lawsuits, investigations, or claims that have been or may be brought against us and, as a result, our business could be materially harmed. These lawsuits, arbitrations, investigations or claims may result in large judgments or settlements against us, any of which could have a negative effect on our financial performance and business. Additionally, lawsuits, arbitrations and investigations can be expensive to defend, whether or not the lawsuit, arbitration or investigation has merit, and the defense of these actions may divert the attention of our management and other resources that would otherwise be engaged in running our business.\nOur operations, including our relationships with healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payers, are subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, and other healthcare laws and regulations, which, in the event of a violation, exposes us to liability for criminal sanctions, civil penalties, and contractual damages, and reputational harm and diminished profits and future earnings.\nOur operations, including any arrangements that we enter into with healthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payers, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. Such laws and regulations, including applicable U.S. federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, as well as foreign laws, such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, may constrain our operation and the business or financial arrangements through which we can market, sell and distribute any drug candidates for which we obtain marketing approval.\nEfforts to confirm that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we become subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Condition\nWe have a history of net losses, and we expect to continue to incur net losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe have incurred net losses since our inception and we expect that our operating losses will continue for the foreseeable future as we continue our drug development efforts and prepare for the potential commercialization of our product candidates. To achieve profitability, we must, either directly or through licensing and/or partnering relationships, meet certain milestones, successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more drug candidates and effectively manufacture, market and sell any drugs we successfully develop. Even if we successfully commercialize drug candidates that receive regulatory approval, we may not be able to realize revenues at a level that would allow us to achieve or sustain profitability. Accordingly, we may never generate significant revenue and, even if we do generate significant revenue, we may never achieve consistent profitability.\nWe will require substantial additional funds to complete our research and development activities.\nOur business currently does not generate the cash that is necessary to finance our operations. Subject to the success of the research and development programs of our Company and our partners, and potential licensing or partnering transactions, we may need to raise additional capital to:\nFund research and development infrastructure and activities relating to the development of our drug candidates, including preclinical and clinical trials and manufacturing to support these efforts;\nFund a commercialization infrastructure and activities related to the sale, marketing, customer support, and distribution of our drug products if and when they become approved;\nFund our general and administrative infrastructure and activities;\nPursue business development opportunities for our technologies;\nAdd to and protect our intellectual property; and\nRetain our management and technical staff.\nOur future capital needs depend on many factors, including:\nThe scope, duration, and expenditures associated with our research and development, including the progression of our clinical trials, with late-stage trials generally requiring greater capital than early-stage trials;\nRegulatory requirements for our clinical trials;\nThe extent to which our research and development and clinical efforts are successful;\nExpenditures to build out or contract for sales, marketing and distribution capabilities as we prepare for the potential commercialization of our product candidates, if any;\nThe outcome of potential partnering or licensing transactions, if any, and the extent to which our business development efforts result in the acquisition of new programs or technologies;\nCompeting technological developments;\nOur intellectual property positions, if any, in our products; and\nThe regulatory approval process and regulatory standards for our drug candidates.\nWe will need to raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements in the future to continue our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions may make it very difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets, and the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further dilution to our stockholders will result, which may substantially dilute the value of investment. In addition, as a condition to providing additional funds to us, future investors may demand, and may be granted, rights superior to those of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities and, in the event of insolvency, would be paid before holders of equity securities received any distribution of corporate assets. In order to raise additional funds through alliance, joint venture or licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to further delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our planned activities. These actions would likely reduce the market price of our common stock.\nIf the estimates we make, or the assumptions on which we rely, in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate, our actual results may vary from those reflected in our accruals.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the amounts of\ncharges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We cannot assure you, however, that our estimates, or the assumptions underlying them, will be correct.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly, which makes our future operating results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, which makes it difficult for us to predict our future operating results. From time to time, we may enter into license or collaboration agreements or strategic partnerships with other companies that include development funding and significant upfront and milestone payments and/or royalties. These upfront and milestone payments may vary significantly from period to period and any such variance could cause a significant fluctuation in our operating results from one period to the next.\nIn addition, we measure compensation cost for stock-based awards made to employees at the grant date of the award, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the cost as an expense over the employees requisite service period. As the variables that we use as a basis for valuing these awards change over time, including our underlying stock price and stock price volatility, the magnitude of the expense that we must recognize may vary significantly.\nFurthermore, our operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of other factors, may of which are outside of our control and may be difficult to predict, including the following:\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, research and development activities relating to our current and any future product candidates, which will change from time to time;\nour ability to enroll patients in clinical trials and the timing of enrollment;\nthe cost of manufacturing our current and any future product candidates, which may vary depending on FDA guidelines and requirements, the quantity of production and the terms of our agreements with manufacturers and other suppliers;\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product candidates and technologies;\nthe timing and outcomes of clinical trials for product candidates;\nthe need to conduct unanticipated clinical trials or trials that are larger or more complex than anticipated;\ncompetition from existing and potential future products that compete with any of our product candidates, and changes in the competitive landscape of our industry, including consolidation among our competitors or partners;\nany delays in regulatory review or approval of any of our product candidates;\nthe level of demand for any of our product candidates, if approved, which may fluctuate significantly and be difficult to predict;\nthe risk/benefit profile, cost and reimbursement policies with respect to our product candidates, if approved, and existing and potential future products that compete with our product candidates;\nour ability to commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved, inside and outside of the United States, either independently or working with third parties;\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborations, licensing or other arrangements;\nour ability to adequately support future growth;\npotential unforeseen business disruptions that increase our costs or expenses;\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\nthe changing and volatile global economic environment.\nThe cumulative effect of these factors could result in large fluctuations and unpredictability in our quarterly and annual operating results. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Investors should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance. This variability and unpredictability could also result in our failing to meet the expectations of industry or financial analysts or investors for any period. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of analysts or investors or below any forecasts we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met any previously publicly stated guidance we may provide.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and fixed income securities is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAt September 30, 2023, we had $403.6 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and fixed income securities. Our investments may also include commercial paper, securities issued by the U.S. government obligations, and money market funds meeting the criteria of our investment policy, which is focused on the preservation of our capital. These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, and market and interest rate risks, particularly in the current\neconomic environment. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments or a complete loss of these investments, which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. The market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits may be limited.\nWe have historically incurred net losses. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating losses (NOLs) carried forward from a prior taxable year. Under that provision, we can carryforward our NOLs to offset our future taxable income, if any, until such NOLs are used or expire. As of September 30, 2023, we had federal and state NOL carryforwards of approximately $134.3 million and $491.5 million, respectively. As a result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020 (CARES Act) and legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act), NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. Under the CARES Act and 2017 Tax Act, federal NOLs incurred in 2018, 2019 and 2020 can generally be carried back five years, carried forward indefinitely and can offset 100% of future taxable income for tax years before January 1, 2021 and up to 80% of future taxable income for tax years after December 31, 2020. Any NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2021, cannot be carried back, but can generally be carried forward indefinitely and can offset up to 80% of future taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. These NOL carryforwards could expire unused before offsetting potential future income tax liabilities.\nIn addition, under Section 382 and 383 of the Code and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an ownership change, which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percent change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period, the corporations ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. It is possible that we have experienced an ownership change limitation. We may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership, some of which may be outside of our control.\nIf an ownership change occurs and our ability to use our NOL carryforwards is materially limited, it would harm our future operating results by effectively increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe could be subject to additional tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal, state, and local taxes in the United States and other countries. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by recognizing tax losses or lower than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. For instance, beginning in 2022, the 2017 Tax Act eliminated the option of expensing all research and development expenditures in the current year, instead requiring amortization over five years for expenditures in the U.S. and over fifteen years for foreign-based expenditures. There is no assurance that the requirement will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified. This change in law increased our tax liability for the fiscal year.We continue to monitor new tax legislation or other developments since significant changes in tax legislation, or in the interpretation of existing legislation, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, we may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes, sales taxes and value-added taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period for which a determination is made.\nOur business is subject to changing regulations for corporate governance and public disclosure that has increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance.\nEach year we are required to evaluate our internal controls systems in order to allow management to report on and our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm to attest to, our internal controls as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. As a result, we continue to incur additional expenses and divert our managements time to comply with these regulations. In addition, if we cannot continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board or The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Investment and Securities\nOur Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of blank check preferred stock, which may make an acquisition of the Company by another company more difficult.\nWe have adopted and may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a takeover or other change in control of the Company that a holder of our common stock might consider in its best interest. For example, our Board of Directors, without further action by our stockholders, currently has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights (including voting rights), preferences and privileges of these shares (blank check preferred). Such preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights, senior to our common stock. These factors could also reduce the price that certain investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe do not intend to declare cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe will not distribute cash to our stockholders unless and until we can develop sufficient funds from operations to meet our ongoing needs and implement our business plan. The time frame for that is unpredictable and investors should not expect dividends in the near future, if at all.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business or if they make adverse recommendations regarding an investment in our stock, our stock price and trading volume may decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock can be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about our business. Currently, coverage of our Company by industry and securities analysts is limited. Investors have many investment opportunities and may limit their investments to companies that receive greater coverage from analysts. If additional industry or securities analysts do not commence coverage of the Company, the trading price of our stock could be negatively impacted. If one or more of the analysts downgrade our stock or comment negatively on our prospects, our stock price may decline. If one or more of these analysts cease to cover our industry or us or fail to publish reports about the Company regularly, our common stock could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could also cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Further, incorrect judgments, estimates or assumptions made by research analysts may adversely affect our stock price, particularly if subsequent performance falls below the levels that were projected by the research analyst(s), even if we did not set or endorse such expectations. Any of these events could cause further volatility in our stock price and could result in substantial declines in the value of our stock.\nThe market for purchases and sales of our common stock may be limited, and the sale of a limited number of shares could cause the price to fall sharply.\nAlthough our common stock is listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, at various times our securities are relatively thinly traded. Investor trading patterns could serve to exacerbate the volatility of the price of our stock. For example, mandatory sales of our common stock by institutional holders could be triggered if an investment in our common stock no longer satisfies their investment standards and guidelines. It may be difficult to sell shares of our common stock quickly without significantly depressing the value of the stock. Unless we are successful in developing continued investor interest in our stock, sales of our stock could result in major fluctuations in the price of the stock.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly over the last several years and may continue to do so in the future, without regard to our results of operations and prospects.\nBecause we are still a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company and have not yet commercialized a drug, there are few objective metrics by which our progress may be measured. Consequently, we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate significantly. We may not continue to generate substantial revenue from the license or sale of our technology for several years, if at all. In the absence of product revenue as a measure of our operating performance, we anticipate that investors and market analysts will assess our performance by considering factors such as:\nAnnouncements of developments related to our business;\nOur ability to enter into or extend investigation phase, development phase, commercialization phase and other agreements with new and/or existing partners;\nAnnouncements regarding the status of any or all of our collaborations or products, including clinical trial results;\nMarket perception and/or investor sentiment regarding our technology;\nAnnouncements of actions taken by regulatory authorities, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration;\nAnnouncements regarding developments in the RNA interference, antisense technologies, gene editing technologies or biotechnology fields in general;\nAnnouncements regarding clinical trial results with our products or competitors products;\nMarket perception and/or announcements regarding other companies developing products in the field of biotechnology generally or specifically RNA interference;\nThe issuance of competitive patents or disallowance or loss of our patent rights;\nThe addition or departure of key executives; and\nVariations in our operating results.\nWe will not have control over many of these factors but expect that they may influence our stock price. As a result, our stock price may be volatile and such volatility could result in the loss of all or part of your investment.\nStockholder equity interest may be substantially diluted in any additional equity issuances.\nWe expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution. We may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner we determine from time to time. If we sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to our existing stockholders.\nWe are subject to stringent and evolving U.S. and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could lead to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation and mass arbitration demands; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; and other adverse business consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information, including personal information, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property, information we collect about trial participants in connection with clinical trials, sensitive third-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information.\nOur data processing activities may subject us to numerous data privacy and security obligations, such as various laws, regulations, guidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, contractual requirements, and other obligations relating to data privacy and security.\nIn the United States, there are state data privacy and security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), HIPPA, and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) applies to personal data of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil penalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover significant statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 expands the CCPAs requirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal data and establishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law.\nOutside the United States, laws, regulations, and industry standards govern data privacy and security. For example, the GDPR imposes strict requirements for processing personal data, including health-related information. Under the GDPR, companies may face fines of up to 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal data. Although there are currently various mechanisms that may be used to transfer personal data from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such as the EEA and UKs standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges. Additionally, companies that transfer personal data out of the EEA and UK to other jurisdictions are subject to scrutiny from regulators, individual litigants, and activities groups.\nPreparing for and complying with these obligations requires us to devote resources and may necessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process personal data on our behalf.\nIf we or the third parties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable data privacy and security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited to: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar); litigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing personal data; and orders to destroy or not use personal data. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of customers; inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to develop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse publicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nEconomic and Industry Risks\nUnfavorable global economic conditions, whether brought about by material global crises, health epidemics, military conflicts or war, geopolitical and trade disputes or other factors, may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nOur business is sensitive to global economic conditions, which can be adversely affected by epidemics and other public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), political and military conflict, trade and other international disputes, significant natural disasters (including as a result of climate change) or other events that disrupt macroeconomic conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recession, new or increased tariffs and other barriers to trade, changes to fiscal and monetary policy or government budget dynamics (particularly in the pharmaceutical and biotech areas), tighter credit, higher interest rates, volatility in financial markets, high unemployment, labor availability constraints, currency fluctuations and other challenges in the global economy have in the past adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, us and our business partners and suppliers.\nFor example, trade policies and geopolitical disputes (including as a result of China-Taiwan relations) and other international conflicts can result in tariffs, sanctions and other measures that restrict international trade, and can materially adversely affect our business, particularly if these measures occur in regions where we source our components or raw materials. For example, tensions between the United States and China have led to a series of tariffs being imposed by the United States on imports from China mainland, as well as other business restrictions. Tariffs increase the costs of the components and raw materials we source. Countries may also adopt other measures, such as controls on imports or exports of goods, technology or data, that could adversely impact the Companys operations and supply chain. These geopolitical risks could also adversely affect Visirna.\nFurther, military conflicts or wars (such as the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Palestine) can cause exacerbated volatility and disruptions to various aspects of the global economy. The uncertain nature, magnitude, and duration of hostilities stemming from such conflicts, including the potential effects of sanctions and counter-sanctions, or retaliatory cyber-attacks on the world economy and markets, have contributed to increased market volatility and uncertainty, which could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic factors that affect our business and operations, such as worldwide supply chain issues. Additionally, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted our business decisions with respect to potential clinical trial sites in Europe. For example, a number of our clinical trial sites we had previously planned to use in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus were shut down and we had to seek alternatives in other geographies. We cannot be certain of the overall impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on our ability to conduct and complete our clinical trials as planned, and any interruptions of our clinical trials can result in significant delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our drug candidates, which could impair our ability to generate revenues and harm our business and financial condition. Moreover, the conflict between Israel and Palestine could impact future business decisions to locate potential clinical trials in Israel. It is not possible to predict the short and long-term implications of military conflicts or wars or geopolitical tensions which could include further sanctions, uncertainty about economic and political stability, increases in inflation rate and energy prices, cyber-attacks, supply chain challenges and adverse effects on currency exchange rates and financial markets.\nAdditionally, our operations and facilities, as well as operations of our suppliers and manufacturers, may be located in areas that are prone to earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters. Such operations and facilities are also subject to the risk of interruption by drought, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health crises (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other events beyond the Companys control. Global climate change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can create delays or interruptions to the Companys development efforts and inefficiencies in the Companys supply and manufacturing chain. Significant delays in our development efforts could materially impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval and to commercialize our products. Any insurance we maintain against damage to our property and the disruption of our business due to disaster may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, because the Company relies on single or limited sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.\nAny public health crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including our business partners and suppliers. In the past four years, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the global economy, including as a result of impacts associated with protective health measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking or might have to take again in the future to manage the pandemic.\nWithout limiting the foregoing, we have experienced and/or may in the future experience:\ndelays in receiving authorization from regulatory authorities to initiate any planned clinical trials, inspections, reviews and approvals of products;\ndelays or difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials;\ndelays in or disruptions to the conduct of preclinical programs and clinical trials;\nconstraints on the movement of products and supplies through the supply chain, which can disrupt our ability to conduct clinical trials and develop our products;\nprice increases in raw materials and capital equipment, as well as increasing price competition in our markets;\nadverse impacts on our workforce and/or key employees; and\nincreased risk that counterparties to our contractual arrangements will become insolvent or otherwise unable to fulfill their contractual obligations.\nDrug development is time consuming, expensive and risky.\nWe are focused on technology related to new and improved pharmaceutical candidates. Product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development, such as in animal and early human clinical trials, often fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as:\nClinical trial results may be unacceptable, even though preclinical trial results were promising;\nInefficacy and/or harmful side effects in humans or animals;\nThe necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA, may not approve our potential product for the intended use, or at all; and/or\nManufacturing and distribution may be uneconomical.\nFor example, any positive preclinical results in animals may not be replicated in human clinical studies. These programs may be also found to be unsafe in humans, particularly at higher doses needed to achieve the desired levels of efficacy. Also, the positive safety results from single dose human clinical studies may not be replicated in other human studies, including multiple dose studies. Clinical and preclinical study results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations by scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians and others, which often delays, limits, or prevents further clinical development or regulatory approvals of potential products. Clinical trials can take many years to complete, including the process of study design, clinical site selection and the recruitment of patients. As a result, we can experience significant delays in completing clinical studies, which can increase the cost of developing a drug candidate and shorten the time that an approved product may be protected by patents. If our drug candidates are not successful in human clinical trials, we may be forced to curtail or abandon certain development programs. If we experience significant delays in commencing or completing our clinical studies, we could suffer from significant cost overruns, which could negatively affect our capital resources and our ability to complete these studies.\nThe healthcare system is under significant financial pressure to reduce costs, which could reduce payment and reimbursement rates for drugs.\nThroughout the world and particularly in the United States, the healthcare system is under significant financial pressure to reduce costs. The price of pharmaceuticals has been a topic of considerable public discussion that could lead to price controls or other price-limiting strategies by payors that have the effect of lowering payment and reimbursement rates for drugs or otherwise making the commercialization of pharmaceuticals less profitable. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. These effects could reduce or eliminate our ability to return value to our stockholders.\nRegulatory standards are subject to change over time, making it difficult to accurately predict the likelihood of marketing approval even when clinical trials meet their endpoints.\nRegulatory standards are promulgated by various government entities and are subject to change based on factors such as scientific developments, public perceptions of risk, and political forces. Because clinical trials often take years to complete, it is sometimes possible for standards that exist during the conception and initiation of a clinical trial to change before the clinical trial is completed or reviewed by government regulators. For example, we may initiate clinical trials that are designed to show benefits on relatively short-term endpoints, but ultimately be required to show benefits in longer-term outcome studies. While some government entities have safeguards intended to ensure standards agreed upon by sponsors and regulators at the outset of a clinical trial are applied during regulatory review processes, those safeguards generally permit regulators to apply more rigorous standards where regulators believe doing so is necessary. As such, there can be no assurance that regulatory standards that are appropriate at the outset of a clinical trial program will not become more rigorous during the regulatory approval process and could potentially result in a delayed approval or denial of marketing authorization. ITEM 1B.UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.

RESERVED ITEM 7.MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOVERVIEW\nThe Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Companys therapies trigger the RNAi interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.\nThe Company has focused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize its high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. The Company believes that TRiMTM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, CNS, muscle, and adipose tissue; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules.\nThe Companys pipeline includes:\nHypertriglyceridemia - Plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3)\nDyslipidemia - Zodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3)\nCardiovascular disease - olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen)\nMuco-obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions - ARO-MUC5AC and ARO-RAGE\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - ARO-MMP7\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD, out-licensed to GSK)\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) - fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT, a collaboration with Takeda)\nChronic hepatitis B virus - JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV, out-licensed to Janssen(1))\nUncontrolled gout - HZN-457 (formerly ARO-XDH, out-licensed to Horizon(2))\nComplement mediated diseases - ARO-C3\nNon-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - ARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795 or ARO-JNJ1)\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - ARO-DUX4\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALS (CNS) - ARO-SOD1\n(1) On October 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Assignment and Consent Agreement with Janssen, whereby, the Company consented to the assignment of the Janssen License Agreement to GSK, which assignment shall be effective upon the receipt of certain anti-trust approvals.\n(2) On October 6, 2023, Amgen announced that it has completed its acquisition of Horizon.\nThe Company operates lab facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Companys principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.\nThe Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as candidate costs. As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.\n2023 Business Highlights\nDuring fiscal year 2023, the Company continued to develop and advance its pipeline and partnered candidates and expanded its facilities to support its growing programs. The bullets below highlight some of these key developments; however, this list is not all-inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of managements discussion and analysis, the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, and all other items contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\npresented data on Companys pulmonary pipeline at the European Respiratory Society (ERS) International Congress 2023 in Milan, Italy in September 2023, which included:\n\u25e6in an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial, ARO-RAGE achieved mean target gene knockdown of up to 90% with a maximum of 95% after a single inhaled administration;\n\u25e6the TRiM\u2122 platform can achieve compelling results across multiple additional gene targets in the lung, including MUC5AC, MMP7, and the Companys newest program against thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a clinically well validated target;\nfiled an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of ARO-DUX4 in July 2023, which is being developed as a potential treatment for patients with facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD);\nhosted a Research & Development (R&D) Day on June 1, 2023 to discuss progress of the Companys pipeline of RNAi Therapeutics, at which the following updates were discussed:\n\u25e6ARO-RAGE showed continued dose response with single inhaled dose of 184 mg achieving mean knockdown of 90% and max of 95%;\n\u25e6adipose delivery platform achieved single dose target gene silencing of greater than 90% with six months of duration in non-human primates;\n\u25e6improved hepatic dimer platform achieved equivalent or better knockdown of two target genes with longer duration than monomer mixture in non-human primates;\n\u25e6TRiM\u2122 platform now has potential to address multiple cell types including liver, solid tumors, lung, central nervous system, skeletal muscle, and adipose;\n\u25e6announced progress towards the Company's 20 in 25 goal to grow its pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that leverage the proprietary Targeted RNAi Molecule (TRiM\u2122) platform to a total of 20 clinical stage or marketed products in the year 2025;\npresented updated data from the Phase 2 SEQUOIA study of investigational RNAi therapy fazirsiran in patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency liver disease which included:\n\u25e6fazirsiran reduced serum Z-AAT concentration in a dose-dependent manner;\n\u25e6fazirsiran significantly reduced liver Z-AAT;

The first development candidate to utilize this new delivery platform is ARO-SOD1. In June 2023, the Company filed a CTA for approval to initiate a Phase 1 clinical study. In preclinical studies, ARO-SOD1 achieved 95% spinal cord tissue mRNA knockdown after a single intrathecal dose in human SOD1 transgenic rats and maintained greater than 80% spinal cord tissue mRNA knockdown three months after a single intrathecal dose in non-human primates;\ndosed the first patient in Takedas Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran for the treatment of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency associated liver diseases, triggering a $40.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023;\ndosed the first patient in GSKs Phase 2b trial of GSK4532990, an investigational RNAi therapeutic for the treatment of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), triggering a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023;\nannounced that the FDA has granted Fast Track designation to ARO-APOC3 for reducing triglycerides in adult patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). ARO-APOC3 was previously granted Orphan Drug designation by the FDA and the European Union;\nannounced interim results from Part 1 of AROC3-1001, an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical study of ARO-C3, which included:\n\u25e6a dose-dependent reduction in serum C3, with 88% mean reduction at highest dose tested;\n\u25e6a dose-dependent reduction in AH50, a marker of alternative complement pathway hemolytic activity, with 91% mean reduction at highest dose tested;\n\u25e6duration of pharmacologic effect supportive of quarterly or less frequent subcutaneous dose administration;\n\u25e6safety and tolerability;\ninitiated dosing in ARO-MMP7-1001 (NCT05537025), a Phase 1/2a single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ARO-MMP7, an investigational RNAi therapeutic designed to reduce expression of matrix metalloproteinase 7 (MMP7) as a potential treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), in up to 56 healthy volunteers and in up to 21 patients with IPF;\nenrolled the first subject in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a development-stage medicine, HZN-457, which is out-licensed to Horizon, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023;\nenrolled the first subject in Amgens Phase 3 trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company, which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023;\nentered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement on November 9, 2022, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront (See Note 11 - Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements.)\n2023 Financial Performance Summary\nNet loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $205.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $176.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Net loss per share - diluted was $1.92 for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to $1.67 for the year ended September 30, 2022. The change in net loss for the\nyear ended September 30, 2023 reflected an increase in research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Companys pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.\nThe Company had $110.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $292.7 million in available-for-sale securities and $765.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2023, as compared to $108.0 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $374.3 million in held-to-maturities debt securities, and $691.9 million of total assets as of September 30, 2022. Based upon the Companys current cash and investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results may vary from what the Company anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change its reported results. The Company believes the following accounting policies are the most critical to it, in that they require its most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information, see Note 1, Organization and Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\nRevenue Recognition-The Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Topic 606 - Revenue for Contracts from Customers. The Company has not yet achieved commercial sales of its drug candidates to date, however, this standard is applicable to its licensing and collaboration agreements. This is discussed further in Note 2, Collaboration and License Agreements of the Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\nAt contract inception, the Company assesses whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation, or whether they are not distinct and are combined with other goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. The Company then determines the transaction price, which typically includes upfront payments and any variable consideration that it determines is probable to not cause a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes the associated revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license to the customer and resulting ability of the customer to use and benefit from the license, if the license is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract. These other performance obligations are typically to perform research and development services for the customer, often times relating to the candidate that the customer is licensing. If the license is not considered to be distinct from other performance obligations, the Company assesses the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, the Company then determines the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from license payments. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the related revenue recognition.\nTypically, the Companys collaboration agreements entitle it to additional payments upon the achievement of milestones or royalties on sales. The milestones are generally categorized into three types: development milestones, generally based on the initiation of toxicity studies or clinical trials; regulatory milestones, generally based on the submission, filing or approval of regulatory applications such as a CTA or a NDA in the United States; and sales-based milestones, generally based on meeting specific thresholds of sales in certain geographic areas. The Company evaluates whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone or royalty will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most-likely-amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for its milestones and royalties, and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and net income in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. Typically, milestone payments and royalties are achieved after the Companys performance obligations associated with the collaboration agreements have been completed and after the customer has assumed responsibility for the respective clinical or preclinical program. Milestones or royalties achieved after the Companys\nperformance obligations have been completed are recognized as revenue in the period the milestone or royalty was achieved. If a milestone payment is achieved during the performance period, the milestone payment would be recognized as revenue to the extent performance had been completed at that point, and the remaining balance would be recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe revenue standard requires the Company to assess whether a significant financing component exists in determining the transaction price. The Company performs this assessment at the onset of its licensing or collaboration agreements. Typically, a significant financing component does not exist because the customer is paying for a license or services in advance with an upfront payment. Additionally, future royalty payments are not substantially within the control of the Company or the customer.\nThe revenue standard requires the Company to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined in the revenue standard as the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which the Company has sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, the Company estimates the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nWhenever we determine that goods or services promised in a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation over time, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using the input method. Labor hours, costs incurred or patient visits in clinical trials are typically used as the measure of performance. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. If the Company determines that the performance obligation is satisfied over time, any upfront payment received is initially recorded as deferred revenue on the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nCollaborative Arrangements-The Company analyzes its collaborative arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards, and therefore an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, either by analogy to appropriate accounting literature or by applying a reasonable accounting policy election. For collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of FASB Topic 808-Collaborative Arrangements, the Company evaluates the income statement classification for presentation of amounts due to or owed from other participants associated with multiple units of account in a collaborative arrangement based on the nature of each activity. Payments or reimbursements that are the result of a collaborative relationship instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development and co-commercialization activities, are recorded as increases or decreases to research and development expense or general and administrative expense, as appropriate.\nLeases-The Company classifies each of its leases as operating or financing considering factors such as the length of the lease term, the present value of the lease payments, the nature of the asset being leased, and the potential for ownership of the asset to transfer during the lease term. Leases with terms greater than one-year are recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets that represent its right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities that represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.\nThe interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. The Company records expense to recognize fixed lease payments on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are expensed as incurred.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following data summarizes the Companys results of operations for the following periods indicated:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nRevenue $ 240,735 $ 243,231 $ 138,287\nOperating loss $ (205,002) $ (178,507) $ (149,036)\nNet loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $ (205,275) $ (176,063) $ (140,848)\nNet loss per share (diluted) attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $ (1.92) $ (1.67) $ (1.36)\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased slightly to $240.7 million, 1.0% from the same period of 2022. The revenue is mainly associated with GSK, Horizon, Takeda and Amgen license agreements, as discussed below. The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808-Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606-Revenue for Contracts from Customers. See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\nGSK\nAt the inception of the GSK License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services, including the Companys responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study (the GSK R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of the GSK R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation.\nThe Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $120.0 million, including the upfront payment, which was collected in January 2022. The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company has allocated the total $120.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the GSK-4532990 license and the associated GSK R&D Services. As the Company has completed its performance obligation related to this agreement, the upfront payment of $120.0 million was fully recognized in the year ended September 30, 2022. Further, GSK dosed the first patient in a Phase 2b trial in March 2023, triggering a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe Company has also performed certain development and manufacturing activities, including drug substance and drug product manufacture under GMP conditions, for GSK pursuant to the GSK License Agreement, for which the Company has been reimbursed for its costs. The Company recognized $0.3 million and $4.8 million in connection with these efforts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nHorizon\nAt the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services, including the Companys responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the Horizon R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Horizon R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation.\nThe Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $40.0 million, including the upfront payment, which was collected in July 2021. The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company allocated the total $40.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the HZN-457 license and the associated Horizon R&D Services. Further, Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and\npharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe Company has performed certain development and manufacturing activities, including drug substance and drug product manufacture under GMP conditions, for Horizon pursuant to the Horizon License Agreement. The Company recognized $1.5 million and $2.5 million in connection with these efforts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTakeda\nAt the inception of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services including the Companys responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the Takeda R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and co-commercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\nUnder the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment in January 2021 and an additional $40.0 million upon Takedas initiation of a Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran in March 2023.\nThe Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue is recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, in August 2023, Takeda initiated a Phase 3 OLE study available to patients participating in these Phase 2 studies. Based on this new information, patients enrolled in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies are expected to complete their Phase 2 study visits between June 2023 and December 2023, shortening the Companys performance obligation. As a result, effective the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its estimates of the revenue recognition to better reflect this newly estimated performance period. The effect of these changes in estimates resulted in accelerated revenue by $70.5 million, or $0.66 per share (diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nAmgen\nUnder the Olpasiran Agreement, the Company has received $35.0 million in upfront payments and $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Companys common stock. Further, the Company received an additional $55.0 million in milestone payments; $10.0 million upon Amgens initiation of a Phase 1 study in September 2018, $20.0 million upon its initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study in July 2020, and $25.0 million upon its first subject enrollment in a Phase 3 trial in December 2022. The Company has substantially completed its performance obligations under the Olpasiran Agreement.\nIn November 2022, Royalty Pharma and the Company entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement. In consideration for the payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive up to an additional $535.0 million in remaining development, regulatory and sales milestone payments payable from Amgen and Royalty Pharma. See Note 13 - Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.\nOperating Expenses\nThe analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 are shown in the tables below.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nR&D expenses are related to the Companys research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Companys research facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&D expenses by individual research and development projects, or by individual drug candidates. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.\nThe following table provides details of research and development expenses:\n(in thousands) Twelve\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember 30, 2023\n% of\nExpense\nCategory Twelve\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember 30, 2022\n% of\nExpense\nCategory Increase (Decrease)\n$ %\nCandidate costs $ 141,436 40 % $ 136,904 46 % $ 4,532 3 %\nR&D discovery costs 76,609 22 % 54,346 18 % 22,263 41 %\nSalaries 73,668 21 % 51,931 17 % 21,737 42 %\nFacilities related 16,267 5 % 12,948 4 % 3,319 26 %\nTotal research and development expense, excluding non-cash expense $ 307,980 87 % $ 256,129 86 % $ 51,851 20 %\nStock compensation 34,332 10 % 32,371 11 % 1,961 6 %\nDepreciation and amortization 10,876 3 % 8,807 3 % 2,069 23 %\nTotal research and development expense $ 353,188 100 % $ 297,307 100 % $ 55,881 19 %\nCandidate costs increased $4.5 million, or 3%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Companys pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher outsourced clinical trial, toxicity study and manufacturing costs.\nR&D discovery costs increased $22.3 million, or 41%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was due to the growth of the Companys discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types.\nSalaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, related benefits and stock compensation for the Companys R&D personnel. The increases in salaries and stock comp expenses for 2023 were primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases. Stock compensation expense was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees.\nFacilities-related expense primarily includes lease costs for the Companys research and development facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin. Facilities-related costs increased $3.3 million, or 26%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was mainly due to the additional lease expense as the Company expands discovery efforts to identify new drug candidates.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, relates to depreciation on lab equipment and leasehold improvements at the facilities.\nThe Company anticipates these R&D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.\nGeneral & Administrative Expenses\nThe following table provides details of general and administrative expenses:\n(in thousands) Twelve\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember 30, 2023\n% of\nExpense\nCategory Twelve\nMonths\nEnded\nSeptember 30, 2022\n% of\nExpense\nCategory Increase (Decrease)\n$ %\nSalaries $ 22,999 25 % $ 16,646 13 % $ 6,353 38 %\nProfessional, outside services, and other\n20,720 22 % 14,738 12 % 5,982 41 %\nFacilities related 3,415 4 % 2,912 2 % 503 17 %\nTotal general & administrative expense, excluding non-cash expense $ 47,134 51 % $ 34,296 28 % $ 12,838 37 %\nStock compensation 43,798 47 % 88,521 71 % (44,723) (51) %\nDepreciation/amortization 1,617 2 % 1,614 1 % 3 - %\nTotal general & administrative expense $ 92,549 100 % $ 124,431 100 % $ (31,882) (26) %\nSalaries expense increased $6.4 million, or 38%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was driven by the combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Companys growth.\nProfessional, outside services, and other expense includes legal, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses, other outside services, travel, and communication and technology expenses. This expense increased $6.0 million, or 41%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due to the cost associated with consulting services focused on the preparation of commercialization activities.\nFacilities related expense primarily includes rental costs and other facilities-related costs for the Companys corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California.\nStock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $44.7 million, or 51%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the lower amount of recognized compensation costs and the reversal of recognized compensation costs related to a performance award where the minimum performance goal was not met. The fair value of market condition-based awards was expensed ratably over the service period and was not adjusted for actual achievement.\nDepreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Companys corporate headquarters.\nOther than with respect to the stock compensation costs described above, the Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other expense was $1.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to other income of $5.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The change was primarily due to the interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties, partially offset by higher yields on investments due to increased interest rates.\nYear Ended September 30, 2022 Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021\nSee Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for a discussion of changes in its results of operations from the year ended September 30, 2022 to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Companys inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Companys pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and commenced the lease agreement for additional facilities in San Diego, California. These expansions are designed to increase the Companys internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities, and the ongoing expansion in Verona, Wisconsin continues to require capital investment. For further information on our capital needs, see the section titled Risks Related to Our Financial Condition in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Companys cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash slightly increased to $110.9 million at September 30, 2023 compared to $108.0 million at September 30, 2022. Cash invested in available-for-sale debt securities was $292.7 million at September 30, 2023 compared to held-to-maturity debt securities of $374.3 million at September 30, 2022. In April 2022, the Company sold all of its investments in mutual funds for $122.3 million.\nOn September 30, 2023, the Company changed the classification of its investment securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. This change enables the Company to sell securities to diversify its portfolio, reduce exposure to market risks, and provide flexibility to meet cash flow needs and new investment opportunities.\nOn December 2, 2022, the Company entered into the Open Market Sale Agreement (See Note 6 - Stockholders Equity to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $250.0 million in shares of the Companys common stock through Jefferies LLC, acting as the sales agent and/or principal, in an at-the-market offering. As of September 30, 2023, no shares have been issued under the Open Market Sale Agreement. The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCash Flow from:\nOperating activities $ (153,890) $ (136,131) $ 171,312\nInvesting activities (96,155) (5,417) (141,678)\nFinancing activities 253,053 65,186 11,305\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 3,008 $ (76,362) $ 40,939\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 110,891 $ 108,005 $ 184,434\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, cash flow used by operating activities was $153.9 million, which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Companys research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the receipt of the $110.0 million from collaboration and license agreements (See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.). Cash used in investing activities was $96.2 million, which was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $176.7 million, offset by net proceeds of $80.6 million from maturities of securities. Cash provided by financing activities of $253.1 million was primarily related to the $250.0 million payment from Royalty Pharma as well as cash received from stock option exercises (See Note 13 - Liability Related to the Sale of Future Royalties of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.).\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, cash flow used by operating activities was $136.1 million, which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Companys research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the receipt of the $120.0 million upfront payment from GSK. Cash used in investing activities was $5.4 million, which was primarily related to the purchase of property and equipment of $52.8 million, offset by net proceeds from maturities of investments of $47.4 million. Cash provided by financing activities of\n$65.2 million was primarily related to the formation of the Companys joint venture, Visirna, as well as cash received from stock option exercises.\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company completed a purchase of 13 acres of land in the Verona Technology Park in Verona, Wisconsin, which is being developed into an approximately 160,000 square foot drug manufacturing facility and an approximately 140,000 square foot laboratory and office facility which will support the Companys process development and analytical activities. The Company is now occupying the laboratory and office facility, but construction of the manufacturing facility is still ongoing. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has incurred $166.2 million and intends to spend an additional $120.0 million to $130.0 million to complete the build out of the facilities.\nAs part of this land acquisition, the Company entered into a development agreement with the City of Verona to construct certain infrastructure improvements within the tax increment district and will be reimbursed up to $16.0 million by the City of Verona by future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property. The total amount of funding that City of Verona will pay under the Tax Increment Financing program is not guaranteed and will depend on future tax revenues generated from the developed property. The Company also became eligible to receive up to $2.5 million in refundable Wisconsin state income tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) as incentives for investing in the local community and creating new job opportunities. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has collected $1.5 million of these credits.\nSee Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Companys Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for a discussion of cash flows from the year ended September 30, 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nFor information related to the Companys future commitments for its facility-related obligations and collaboration and licensing agreements, see Notes 8 and 2, respectively, of Notes to the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules. Commitments related to the Companys clinical, manufacturing and business operation related agreements are $579.7 million as of September 30, 2023, but many of these agreements are cancellable. ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is subject to market risk exposures primarily due to its investing activities. The primary market risk exposure is change in interest rates. Adverse changes to rates may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market or to changes in market perceptions of creditworthiness and risk tolerance.\nThe Company does not hold any instruments for trading purposes and investment criteria are governed by its Investment Policy. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash of $110.9 million and $108.0 million, respectively, and investments of $292.7 million and $374.3 million, respectively. The Company has invested its cash reserves in corporate bonds typically with maturities of less than 3 years and historically classified these investments as held-to-maturity. On September 30, 2023, the Company changed the classification of its investment securities from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale. This change enables the Company to sell securities to diversify its portfolio, reduce exposure to market risks, and provide flexibility to meet cash flow needs and new investment opportunities. Due to the relatively short-term nature of the investments that the Company holds, it does not believe that the results of operations or cash flows would be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates relative to its investment portfolio. ITEM 8.FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe information required by this item is included in Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9.CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A.CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nAs required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the foregoing, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nThis process includes those policies and procedures that:\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Companys assets;\n(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Companys management and directors; and\n(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because either conditions change or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2023.\nRose, Snyder and Jacobs LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the Companys most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The Companys process for evaluating controls and procedures is continuous and encompasses consistent improvement of the design and effectiveness of established controls and procedures and the remediation of any deficiencies which may be identified during this process.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated November 29, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Revenue Recognized Over Time\nDescription of the Matter\nAs discussed in Note 1 and Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company earns its revenue through license and collaboration agreements. For performance obligations related to services that are required to be recognized over time, the Company measures its progress to completion using various measures, including an input measure of total labor costs incurred divided by total labor costs expected to be incurred, time elapsed, and an output measure of total patient visits divided by total patient visits expected. The selection of measurement criteria is based on the nature and phase of trials being conducted.\nAuditing revenue recognition is complex and highly judgmental due to the variability and uncertainty associated with the Companys assessment of measure of progress. Changes in these estimates would have a significant effect on the amount of revenue recognized.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls that address the risk of material misstatement of license and collaboration agreement revenue including those associated with cost to complete estimates. We tested controls over managements process to collect, review, and approve the data used in assessing revenue recognized over time.\nTo test the measures of progress used for performance obligations related to services that are required to be recognized over time, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the appropriateness of the Companys accounting policy for each type of arrangement, testing the identified measure of performance by reading contracts with customers, including all amendments, and reviewing the contract analyses prepared by management. We evaluated whether the selected measures of progress towards satisfaction of performance obligations were applied consistently. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used for the measure of progress by testing and or analyzing the underlying data.\nRose, Snyder & Jacobs LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2004.\nEncino, California\nNovember 29, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and\nStockholders of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (the Companys) internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss), stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 and related notes, and our report dated November 29, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nRose, Snyder & Jacobs LLP\nEncino, CA\nNovember 29, 2023\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 110,891 $ 108,005\nAccounts receivable -

ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nGeneral\nArrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as the Company) are primarily engaged in developing medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Companys therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference (RNAi) is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. The Companys RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.\nThe following table presents the Companys current pipeline:\nTherapeutic Area Name Stage Product Rights\nCardiometabolic Plozasiran (ARO-APOC3)\nTwo Phase 2b and one Phase 3 Arrowhead\nZodasiran (ARO-ANG3)\nTwo Phase 2b Arrowhead\nOlpasiran Phase 3 Amgen\nPulmonary ARO-RAGE Phase 1/2a\nArrowhead\nARO-MUC5AC Phase 1/2a Arrowhead\nARO-MMP7 Phase 1/2a\nArrowhead\nLiver GSK-4532990 Phase 2b GSK\nFazirsiran Phase 3 Takeda and Arrowhead\nJNJ-3989 Phase 2 Janssen(1)\nHZN-457 Phase 1 Horizon(2)\nARO-C3 Phase 1/2a\nArrowhead\nARO-PNPLA3 Phase 1\nArrowhead\nMuscle\nARO-DUX4 Pre-Clinical Arrowhead\nCentral Nervous System (CNS)\nARO-SOD1 Pre-Clinical Arrowhead\n(1) On October 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Assignment and Consent Agreement with Janssen. See Note 15.\n(2) On October 6, 2023, Amgen announced that it has completed its acquisition of Horizon.\nThe Company operates lab facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Companys principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.\nConsolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (wholly-owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary). Subsidiaries refer to Arrowhead Madison, Inc., Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. (Visirna), and Arrowhead Australia Pty Ltd. For subsidiaries in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained in such entity by the respective noncontrolling party.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.\nLiquidity\nThe Companys primary sources of financing have been through the sale of its securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Companys inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future, particularly as the Companys pipeline of drug candidates and its headcount have both expanded\nsignificantly. Additionally, significant capital investment will be required as the Companys pipeline matures into later stage clinical trials and as the Company plans to increase its internal manufacturing capabilities.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company had $110.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash ($7.9 million in restricted cash) and $292.7 million in available-for-sale debt securities to fund operations. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Companys cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments balance decreased by $78.6 million which was primarily due to cash used to fund its operations, offset by the $250.0 million upfront payment received from Royalty Pharma (Note 13) and $110.0 million in milestone payments from the Companys collaboration and license agreements (Note 2).\nIn total, the Company is eligible to receive up to $2.8 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones, and may receive various royalties on net sales from its licensing and collaboration agreements, subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements. The revenue recognition for these collaboration agreements is discussed further in Note 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, judgments and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expense. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nVariable Interest Entity (VIE)\nA VIE is an entity that, by design, either (i) lacks sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (ii) has equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entitys operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE through its interest in the VIE.\nOn April 25, 2022, the Company entered into a license agreement with Visirna (Note 2) and consolidated Visirnas financial statements in which the Company has a direct controlling financial interest based on the VIE model.\nThe Company considers all the facts and circumstances, including its role in establishing Visirna and its ongoing rights and responsibilities to assess whether the Company has the power to direct the activities of Visirna. In general, the parties that make the most significant decisions affecting a VIE and have the right to unilaterally remove those decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE.\nThe Company also considers all of its economic interests to assess whether the Company has the obligation to absorb losses of Visirna or the right to receive benefits from it that could potentially be significant to Visirna. This assessment requires the Company to apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered potentially significant to Visirna. Factors considered in assessing the significance include: the design of the Visirna, including its capitalization structure, subordination of interests, payment priority, and the reasons why the interests are held by the Company.\nAt Visirnas inception, the Company determined whether it was the primary beneficiary and if Visirna should be consolidated based on the facts and circumstances. The Company performs ongoing reassessments of the VIE based on reconsideration events and reevaluates whether a change to the consolidation is required. As of September 30, 2023, there were no events to be reconsidered in the consolidation.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAll highly liquid interest-bearing investments are classified as cash equivalents. These investments mainly include commercial paper with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The carrying value of these cash equivalents approximate fair value.\nThere was $7.9 million and $7.3 million restricted cash at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, that is primarily held as collateral associated with letters of credit for the Companys facility leases.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially expose the Company to concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Companys investments were primarily invested in money market funds, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and corporate debt securities through highly rated financial institutions. The Company also maintains several bank accounts primarily at three financial institutions for its operations. These accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per institution. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which these deposits are held.\nInvestments\nInvestment securities are mainly held-to-maturity investments, available-for-sale, and marketable securities.\nThese held-to-maturity investments may consist of investment-grade interest bearing instruments, primarily money market accounts, government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate bonds and/or commercial paper, which are stated at amortized cost. The Company does not intend to sell these investment securities and the contractual maturities are not greater than 36 months. Those with maturities less than twelve months are included in short-term investments on the Companys consolidated balance sheets, while those with remaining maturities in excess of twelve months are included in long-term investments on its consolidated balance sheets. Discounts and premiums to par value of the debt securities are amortized to interest income/expense over the term of the security, and no gains or losses on held-to-maturity investment are realized until they are sold. The Company reassesses the classification of held-to-maturity at each reporting period.\nThe available-for-sale investments may consist of investment-grade interest bearing instruments, primarily money market accounts, government-sponsored enterprise securities, corporate bonds and/or commercial paper, which are accounted for at fair value. Changes in fair values are reported as unrealized gains or losses and are recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. On September 30, 2023, the Company changed the classification of debt securities to available-for-sale from held-to-maturity. As a result, these debt securities are carried at fair value.\nThe Companys marketable debt securities consisted of mutual funds that primarily invest in U.S. government bonds, U.S. government agency bonds, and corporate bonds. Dividends from these funds were automatically re-invested. These securities were recorded at fair value, and all unrealized gains/losses were recorded in the Companys consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. In April 2022, the Company sold all of its investments in mutual funds for $122.3 million.\nThe Company monitors its investments closely. If an unrealized loss is determined to be other-than-temporary, it is written off as a realized loss through the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The Companys methodology of assessing other-than-temporary impairments is based on security-specific analysis as of the balance sheet date and considers various factors, including the length of time to maturity and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost, recoverability of future cash flows as compared to carrying value of the security, the financial condition and the near-term prospects of the issuer, and the Companys ability and intent to hold the security. If a decline in fair value of investments is determined to be other-than-temporary, the securities are written down to fair value as the new cost basis and the amount of the write down is accounted for as realized losses. The Company did not recognize any other-than-temporary impairments of its investment for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight-line method over the respective useful lives of the assets ranging from three to seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the expected useful life or the remaining lease term.\nThe Company periodically assesses long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the Company identifies an indicator of impairment, the Company assesses recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset.\nAn impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value. There were no impairment charges during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nIntangible Assets Subject to Amortization\nIntangible assets subject to amortization include certain patents and license agreements. The Company qualitatively evaluates intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of intangible assets may exceed their implied fair values. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, intangible impairment assessments indicated that there was no impairment.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract is, or contains, a lease at inception. All of the Companys leases are classified as operating leases. Leases with terms greater than one-year are recognized on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as right-of-use assets that represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities that represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of lease payments over the expected lease term.\nThe interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, the Company utilizes the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis an amount equal to the lease payments over a similar term and in a similar economic environment. The Company records expense to recognize lease payments on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. Costs determined to be variable and not based on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and are expensed as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe revenue standard provides a five-step framework for recognizing revenue as control of promised goods or services is transferred to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that it determines are within the scope of the revenue standard, the Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, the Company assesses whether the goods or services promised within each contract are distinct and, therefore, represent a separate performance obligation, or whether they are not distinct and are combined with other goods and services until a distinct bundle is identified. The Company then determines the transaction price, which typically includes upfront payments and any variable consideration that it determines is probable to not cause a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation and recognizes the associated revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company recognizes the transaction price allocated to upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license to the customer and resulting ability of the customer to use and benefit from the license, if the license is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the contract. These other performance obligations are typically to perform research and development services for the customer, often times relating to the candidate that the customer is licensing. If the license is not considered to be distinct from other performance obligations, the Company assesses the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied at a point in time or over time. If the performance obligation is satisfied over time, the Company then determines the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue from license payments. The Company evaluates the measure of progress each reporting period and, if necessary, adjusts the related revenue recognition.\nTypically, the Companys collaboration agreements entitle it to additional payments upon the achievement of milestones or royalties on sales. The milestones are generally categorized into three types: development milestones, generally based on the initiation of toxicity studies or clinical trials; regulatory milestones, generally based on the submission, filing or approval of regulatory applications such as a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) or a New Drug Application (NDA) in the United States; and sales-based milestones, generally based on meeting specific thresholds of sales in certain geographic areas. The Company evaluates whether it is probable that the consideration associated with each milestone or royalty will not be subject to a significant reversal in the cumulative amount of revenue recognized. Amounts that meet this threshold are included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method, whereas amounts that do not meet this threshold are excluded from the transaction price until they meet this threshold. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the Company re-evaluates the probability of a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized for its milestones and royalties, and, if necessary, adjusts its estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis, which would affect revenues and net income in the Companys consolidated statements of operation and comprehensive loss. Typically, milestone payments and royalties are achieved after the Companys performance obligations associated with the collaboration agreements have been completed and after the customer has assumed responsibility for the respective clinical or preclinical program. Milestones or royalties achieved after the Companys performance obligations have been completed are recognized as revenue in the period the milestone or royalty was achieved. If a milestone payment is achieved during the performance period, the milestone payment would be recognized as revenue to the extent performance had been completed at that point, and the remaining balance would be recorded as deferred revenue.\nThe revenue standard requires the Company to assess whether a significant financing component exists in determining the transaction price. The Company performs this assessment at the onset of its licensing or collaboration agreements. Typically, a significant financing component does not exist because the customer is paying for a license or services in advance with an upfront payment. Additionally, future royalty payments are not substantially within the control of the Company or the customer.\nFurther, the revenue standard requires the Company to allocate the arrangement consideration on a relative standalone selling price basis for each performance obligation after determining the transaction price of the contract and identifying the performance obligations to which that amount should be allocated. The relative standalone selling price is defined in the revenue standard as the price at which an entity would sell a promised good or service separately to a customer. If other observable transactions in which the Company has sold the same performance obligation separately are not available, the Company estimates the standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Key assumptions to determine the standalone selling price may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical and regulatory success.\nWhenever the Company determines that goods or services promised in a contract should be accounted for as a combined performance obligation over time, the Company determines the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using the input method; Labor hours, costs incurred or patient visits in clinical trials are typically used as the measure of performance. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which the Company is expected to complete its performance obligations. If the Company determines that the performance obligation is satisfied over time, any upfront payment received is initially recorded as deferred revenue on its consolidated balance sheets.\nCertain judgments affect the application of the Companys revenue recognition policy. For example, the Company records short-term (less than one year) and long-term (over one year) deferred revenue based on its best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized. This estimate is based on the Companys current operating plan and, the Company may recognize a different amount of deferred revenue over the next 12-month period if its plan changes in the future.\nCollaborative Arrangements\nThe Company analyzes its collaborative arrangements to assess whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards, and therefore are within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Topic 808 - Collaborative Arrangements. For collaborative arrangements that contain multiple elements, the Company determines which units of account are deemed to be within the scope of Topic 808 and which units of account are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship, and therefore are within the scope of Topic 606. For units of account that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, either by analogy to appropriate accounting literature or by applying a reasonable accounting policy election. For collaborative arrangements that are within the scope of Topic 808, the Company evaluates the income statement classification for presentation of amounts due to or owed from other participants associated with multiple units of account in a collaborative arrangement based on the nature\nof each activity. Payments or reimbursements that are the result of a collaborative relationship instead of a customer relationship, such as co-development and co-commercialization activities, are recorded as increases or decreases to research and development expense or general and administrative expense, as appropriate.\nResearch and Development\nCosts and expenses that can be clearly identified as research and development are charged to expense as incurred. Included in research and development costs are operating costs, facilities, supplies, external services, clinical trial and manufacturing costs, overhead directly related to the Companys research and development operations, and costs to acquire technology licenses.\nStock-Based Compensation\nShare-based compensation expenses for all stock grants are based on their estimated grant-date fair value. The fair value of stock option awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model which requires the input of subjective assumptions to calculate the value of stock options. For restricted stock units, the value of the award is based on the Companys stock price at the grant date. For performance-based restricted stock unit awards, the value of the award is based on the Companys stock price at the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of the performance condition being achieved. The Company uses historical data and other information to estimate the expected price volatility and the expected forfeiture rate for stock option awards. Expense is recognized over the vesting period for all awards and commences at the grant date for time-based awards and upon the Companys determination that the achievement of such performance conditions is probable for performance-based awards. This determination requires significant judgment by management.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial reporting basis and the respective tax basis of the Companys assets and liabilities, and expected benefits of utilizing net operating loss, capital loss, and tax-credit carryforwards. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized and, to the extent management does not believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares primarily consist of stock options and restricted stock units outstanding.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the calculation of the effect of dilutive stock options and restricted stock units excluded all stock options and restricted stock units outstanding during the period due to their anti-dilutive effect.\nForeign currency translation adjustments\nOne of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries functional currencies are not the United States dollar, which is the Companys reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the reporting period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThere have been no recent accounting pronouncements that have significantly impacted this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNOTE 2. COLLABORATION AND LICENSE AGREEMENTS\nThe following table provides a summary of revenue recognized:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nGSK $ 29,657 $ 124,764 $ -\nHorizon 23,206 29,181 6,816\nTakeda 162,516 85,834 90,784\nJanssen 356 3,452 40,687\nAmgen 25,000 - -\nTotal $ 240,735 $ 243,231 $ 138,287\nThe following table summarizes the balance of receivables and contract liabilities related to the Companys collaboration and license agreements:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nReceivables included in accounts receivable $ - $ 1,410\nContract liabilities included in deferred revenue $ 866 $ 130,049\nGlaxosmithkline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited (GSK)\nOn November 22, 2021, GSK and the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the GSK License Agreement). Under the GSK License Agreement, GSK has received an exclusive license for GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD). The exclusive license is worldwide with the exception of greater China. GSK is wholly responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of GSK-4532990 in its territory.\nAt the inception of the GSK License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services, including the Companys responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study (the GSK R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of the GSK R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation.\nThe Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $120.0 million, including the upfront payment, which was collected in January 2022. The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company has allocated the total $120.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the GSK-4532990 license and the associated GSK R&D Services. As the Company has completed its performance obligation related to this agreement, the upfront payment of $120.0 million was fully recognized in the year ended September 30, 2022. Further, GSK dosed the first patient in a Phase 2b trial in March 2023, triggering a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\nThe Company is also eligible for an additional payment of $100.0 million upon achieving the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, should the Phase 3 trial read out positively, and the potential new medicine receives regulatory approval in major markets, the deal provides for commercial milestone payments to the Company of up to $190.0 million at first commercial sale, and up to $590.0 million in sales-related milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales in a range of mid-teens to twenty percent.\nThe Company has also performed certain development and manufacturing activities, including the manufacture of drug substance and drug product under GMP conditions, for GSK pursuant to the GSK License Agreement, for which the Company has been reimbursed for its costs. The Company recognized $0.3 million and $4.8 million in connection with these efforts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nHorizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC (Horizon)\nOn June 18, 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the Horizon License Agreement). Under the terms of the Horizon License Agreement, Horizon received a worldwide exclusive license for HZN-457, a clinical-stage medicine being developed by Horizon as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled\ngout. Horizon is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of HZN-457. On October 6, 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon.\nAt the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services, including the Companys responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the Horizon R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Horizon R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Horizon R&D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Horizon will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization of HZN-457. The Company conducted all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, the Company received an upfront payment of $40.0 million in July 2021. The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $40.0 million and has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company allocated the total $40.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the HZN-457 license and the associated Horizon R&D Services. Revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&D Services. The Company determined that the straight-line basis was appropriate as its efforts were expended evenly over the course of completing its performance obligation. Further, Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.\nOn November 21, 2023, the Company received notice from Horizon that it has elected to terminate the Horizon License Agreement. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience. The termination will take effect on December 21, 2023.\nIn addition, the Company has performed certain development and manufacturing activities, including drug substance and drug product manufacture under GMP conditions, for Horizon pursuant to the Horizon License Agreement. The Company recognized $1.5 million and $2.5 million in connection with these efforts for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda)\nOn October 7, 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Co-Funding Agreement (the Takeda License Agreement). Under the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda and the Company will co-develop the Companys Fazirsiran program (formerly TAK-999 and ARO-AAT), the Companys second-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a treatment for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Within the United States, fazirsiran, if approved, will be co-commercialized under a 50/50 profit sharing structure. Outside the United States, Takeda received an exclusive license to commercialize fazirsiran and will lead the global commercialization strategy, while the Company will be eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20% to 25% on net sales.\nAt the inception of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services including the Companys responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the Takeda R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and co-commercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.\nUnder the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment in January 2021 and an additional $40.0 million upon Takedas initiation of a Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran in March 2023, and is eligible to receive up to $527.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones.\nThe Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue is recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, in August 2023, Takeda initiated a Phase 3 OLE study available to patients participating in these Phase 2 studies. Based on this new information, patients enrolled in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies are expected to complete their Phase 2 study visits between June 2023 and December 2023, shortening the Companys performance obligation. As a result, effective the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its estimates of the revenue recognition to better reflect this newly estimated performance period. The effect of these changes in estimates resulted in accelerated revenue by $70.5 million, or $0.66 per share (diluted) for the year ended September 30, 2023. There were $0.9 million of contract liabilities recorded as current deferred revenue as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company also recorded $4.5 million as accrued expenses as of September 30, 2023 that was primarily driven by co-development and co-commercialization activities.\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen)\nOn October 3, 2018, Janssen, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, and the Company entered into a License Agreement (the Janssen License Agreement). The Company also entered into a stock purchase agreement with JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), Johnson & Johnsons venture capital arm (the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement). Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Companys JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV) program, the Companys third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potential therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Companys Phase 1/2 study of JNJ-3989, which the Company was responsible for completing, Janssen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of JNJ-3989.\nUnder the terms of the Janssen License Agreement, the Company received $175.0 million as an upfront payment, $75.0 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in the Companys common stock under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, and milestone and option payments totaling $73.0 million, and the Company may receive up to $825.0 million in development and sales milestone payments for the Janssen License Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales up to mid-teens under the Janssen License Agreement.\nAt the inception of the Janssen License Agreement, the Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services including the Companys responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study of JNJ-3989 and the Companys responsibility to ensure certain manufacturing of JNJ-3989 drug product is completed and delivered to Janssen (the Janssen R&D Services). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Janssen R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation.\nThe Company determined the transaction price totaled approximately $252.7 million, which includes the upfront payment, the premium paid by JJDC for its equity investment in the Company, two $25.0 million milestone payments related to JNJ-3989, and estimated payments for reimbursable Janssen R&D Services to be performed. The Company has allocated the total $252.7 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the JNJ-3989 license and the associated Janssen R&D Services. The Company recognized this transaction price in its entirety as of September 30, 2021, as its performance obligations were substantially completed. There were no contract assets and liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2023.\nOn April 7, 2023, Janssen voluntarily terminated its collaboration agreement with the Company, dated October 3, 2018. Upon termination of the collaboration agreement, the Company regained full rights to ARO-PNPLA3, formerly called JNJ-75220795.

The amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation was filed on April 27, 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, 12,709,837 and 14,000,392 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon exercise of options and vesting of restricted stock units granted or available for grant under the Companys 2004 Equity Incentive Plan, 2013 Incentive Plan, and 2021 Incentive Plan, as well as for inducement grants made to new employees under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nOn December 2, 2022, the Company entered into an open market sale agreement (the Open Market Sale Agreement), pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $250,000,000 in shares of the Companys common stock through Jefferies LLC, acting as the sales agent and/or principal, in an at-the-market offering (ATM Offering). The Company is not required to sell shares under the Open Market Sale Agreement. The Company will pay Jefferies LLC a commission of up to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds received from all sales of the common stock under the Open Market Sale Agreement. Unless otherwise terminated, the ATM Offering shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the sale of all shares of common stock subject to the Sales Agreement and (ii) the termination of the Sales Agreement as permitted therein. The Company and Jefferies may each terminate the Open Market Sale Agreement at any time upon prior notice. As of September 30, 2023, no shares have been issued under the Open Market Sale Agreement.\nNOTE 7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, the Company may be subject to various claims and legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. If the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount is reasonably estimable, the Company will accrue a liability for the estimated loss. There were no contingent liabilities recorded as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nCommitments\nOn December 20, 2021, the Company completed a purchase of 13 acres of land in the Verona Technology Park in Verona, Wisconsin, which is being developed into an approximately 160,000 square foot drug manufacturing facility and an approximately 140,000 square foot laboratory and office facility which will support the Companys process development and analytical activities. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has incurred $166.2 million and intends to spend an additional $120.0 million to $130.0 million to complete the build out of the facilities.\nAs part of this land acquisition, the Company entered into a development agreement with the City of Verona to construct certain infrastructure improvements within the tax increment district and will be reimbursed up to $16.0 million by the City of Verona by future tax increment revenue generated from the developed property. The total amount of funding that City of Verona will pay under the Tax Increment Financing program is not guaranteed and will depend on future tax revenues generated from the developed property. The Company also became eligible to receive up to $2.5 million in refundable Wisconsin state income tax credits from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEDC) as incentives for investing in the local community and creating new job opportunities. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has collected $1.5 million of these credits.\nTechnology License Commitments\nThe Company has licensed from third parties the rights to use certain technologies for its research and development activities, as well as in any products it may develop using these licensed technologies. These agreements and other similar agreements often require the Company to make milestone and royalty payments. Milestone payments, for example, may be\nrequired as the research and development process progresses through various stages of development, such as when clinical candidates enter or progress through clinical trials, upon NDA and/or certain sales level milestones. The Company did not reach any milestones during the years of 2023 and 2022. During 2021, the Company triggered the milestone related to the progression of the ARO-ENaC and ARO-HIF2 candidates and made milestone payments of $2.4 million.\nNOTE 8. LEASES\nOn November 19, 2021, the Company entered into a 15-year lease for approximately 144,000 square feet of office and research and development laboratory space in San Diego, California, for which the rent commencement date began on April 19, 2023. This new facility accommodates increased personnel for its expanding pipeline of current and future drug candidates. Pursuant to the lease, within twelve months of the expiration of the initial 15-year term, the Company has the option to extend the lease for up to one additional ten-year term, with certain annual increases in base rent.\nThe lease agreement grants the Company the right to receive an Additional Tenant Improvement Allowance (ATIA) funded by the lessor, with a maximum amount of $7.2 million, subject to a 7% interest per annum over the base term. Further, on September 25, 2023, the Company executed the first amendment to the lease, which grants a second ATIA with a maximum amount of $23.6 million, bearing interest at a rate of 9% per annum over the base term. The Company has received $27.8 million ATIA from the lessor as of September 30, 2023. As a result, the Company remeasured its lease liability and right-of-use assets to reflect these additional allowances and the related increase lease payments. The Company has further concluded that these ATIAs have no effects on the classification of the lease.\nOther Significant Leases\nPasadena, California: The Company leases 49,000 square feet of office space located at 177 East Colorado Blvd. for its corporate headquarters from 177 Colorado Owner, LLC, which lease expires on April 30, 2027.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company has three plans that provide for equity-based compensation. Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2004 Plan) and the 2013 Incentive Plan (the 2013 Plan), 0 and 3,408,707 shares, respectively, of the Companys common stock are reserved for the grant of stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and directors of the Company as of September 30, 2023.\nOn March 18, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors approved the Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2021 Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan), which authorized 8,000,000 shares (subject to certain adjustments) available for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance awards, cash awards and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Companys common stock. The maximum number of shares authorized under the 2021 Plan will be (i) reduced by any shares subject to awards made under the 2013 Plan after January 1, 2021, and (ii) increased by any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan as of January 1, 2021 that, after January 1, 2021, are canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under such awards (other than as a result of being tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes in connection with any such awards) or settled in cash. As of September 30, 2023, the total number of shares reserved for issuance was 6,204,720 shares, which includes 217,922 shares that were forfeited under the 2013 Plan, and 1,979,364 shares have been granted under the 2021 Plan.\nIn addition, there were 707,432 shares reserved for options and 683,825 shares reserved for restricted stock units issued as inducement grants to new employees granted outside of the Companys equity-based compensation plans under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.\nThe following table presents a summary of awards outstanding:\nAs of September 30, 2023\n2004 Plan 2013 Plan 2021 Plan Inducement Awards Total\nGranted and outstanding awards:\nOptions - 1,522,207 33,838 707,432 2,263,477\nRestricted stock units - 1,886,500 1,671,315 683,825 4,241,640\nTotal - 3,408,707 1,705,153 1,391,257 6,505,117\nStock Option Awards\nThe following table presents a summary of the stock option activity for the year ended September 30, 2023:\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nPer Share Weighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (Years) Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 2,721,384 $ 20.73\nGranted 32,151 33.03\nCancelled or expired (50,708) 60.72\nExercised (439,350) 6.94\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 2,263,477 $ 22.68 4.3 $ 26,795,879\nExercisable at September 30, 2023 2,141,592 $ 21.45 4.2 $ 26,786,757\nThe aggregate intrinsic values represent the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $12.2 million, $27.6 million and $66.9 million, respectively.\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $8.4 million, $10.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the pre-tax compensation expense for all outstanding unvested stock options in the amount of $2.9 million will be recognized in the Companys results of operations over a weighted average period of 0.4 years.\nThe fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The determination of the fair value of each stock option is affected by the Companys stock price on the date of grant, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and\nsubjective variables. Because the Companys employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.\nThe following table provides the assumptions used in the calculation of grant-date fair values of these stock options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022(5)\nExpected dividend yield(1)\n- - -\nRisk-free interest rate(2)\n3.69 - 4.57%\nN/A 0.40 - 1.1%\nExpected volatility(3)\n86.4\nN/A 86.2 - 90.4%\nExpected term (in years)(4)\n6.25 N/A 6.25\nWeighted-average grant date fair value per share 25.61 N/A 48.64\n(1) The dividend yield is zero as the Company currently does not pay a dividend.\n(2) The risk-free interest rate is based on that of the U.S. Treasury yields with equivalent terms in effect at the time of the grant..\n(3) Volatility is estimated based on volatility average of the Companys common stock price.\n(4) The expected term represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding, by using historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior.\n(5) No options were granted during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units (RSUs), including market-based, time-based and performance-based awards, have been granted under the Companys 2013 and 2021 Plans and as inducements grants granted outside of the Companys equity-based compensation plans. At vesting, each outstanding RSU will be exchanged for one share of the Companys common stock. RSU awards generally vest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements or the satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain performance targets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the Companys RSUs:\nNumber of\nRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant\nDate\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2022 4,069,931 $ 64.39\nGranted 1,243,644 34.32\nVested (913,146) 52.99\nForfeited (158,789) 53.80\nOutstanding as of September 30, 2023 4,241,640 $ 58.43\nThe fair value of RSUs was determined based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of achieving service and/or performance conditions for awards.\nOn July 8, 2022, the Company revised the equity award made to its Chief Executive Officer on January 1, 2022 consisting of 800,000 shares, equal in value to $38.4 million, that was a 100% market-based award. The revised awards consist of 99,521 RSUs and 149,282 performance-based RSUs. No incremental expense resulted from the modification. The fair values of these awards were estimated on the date of grant using a closed-form valuation model (Monte-Carlo).\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $69.7 million, $113.6 million and $64.2 million, respectively, related to shares of RSUs. As of September 30, 2023, there was $94.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years.\nNOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date using the exit price. Accordingly, when market observable data are not readily available, the Companys own assumptions are used to reflect those that market participants would be presumed to use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values and the level of market price observability, as follows:\nLevel 1 Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are based on the following:\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; or\nEither directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3). The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.\nThe Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or from Level 2 to Level 3. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances that caused the transfer. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements\nThe following table presents information about the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company:\nSeptember 30, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nU.S. government bonds $ 31,553 $ - $ - $ 31,553\nMunicipal securities - 7,093 - 7,093\nCommercial notes - 22,205 - 22,205\nCorporate debt securities - 231,884 - 231,884\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities\n31,553 261,182 - 292,735\nMoney market instruments 347 - - 347\nTotal financial assets\n$ 31,900 $ 261,182 $ - $ 293,082\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\n(in thousands)\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities\nU.S. government bonds $ 1,973 $ - $ - $ 1,973\nMunicipal securities - - - -\nCommercial notes - 41,727 - 41,727\nCorporate debt securities - 271,333 - 271,333\nCertificate of deposits 50,000 - - 50,000\nTotal held-to-maturity debt securities\n51,973 313,060 - 365,033\nMoney market instruments 39,262 - - 39,262\nTotal financial assets\n$ 91,235 $ 313,060 $ - $ 404,295\nDebt securities were reclassified from held-to-maturity to available-for-sale recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of debt securities are priced using model pricing based on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices as provided by an independent third party, and under GAAP are considered a Level 2 input.\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, and 3 of the fair value hierarchy during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses of the Company approximate fair value based on the short maturities of these instruments. At September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities.\nNOTE 11. INCOME TAXES\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe components of the loss before income taxes are as follows:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nDomestic\n$ (194,639) $ (170,570) $ (140,846)\nForeign\n(7,852) (1,708) -\nTotal\n$ (202,491) $ (172,278) $ (140,846)\nThe provision for income taxes consisted of the following components:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$ 1,074 $ - $ -\nState\n1,710 304 2\nForeign\n- 3,481 -\nTotal current tax\n$ 2,784 $ 3,785 $ 2\nDeferred:\nFederal\n$ - $ - $ -\nState\n- - -\nForeign\n- - -\nTotal deferred tax\n$ - $ - $ -\nIncome tax provision $ 2,784 $ 3,785 $ 2\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the tax expense based on the statutory rate to the Companys actual tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations. A notional 21% tax rate was applied as follows:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. federal statutory income tax 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal tax benefit 0.4 % 8.6 % 7.0 %\nTax credits 6.8 % - % - %\nPermanent and other items -4.6 % -1.7 % - %\nNon-deductible compensation -4.6 % - % - %\nForeign-derived intangible income deduction 1.2 % - % - %\nStock compensation -1.1 % -1.7 % 1.3 %\nValuation allowance -20.5 % -28.4 % -29.3 %\nEffective income tax rate -1.4 % -2.2 % - %\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe following table presents the significant components of the Companys net deferred tax assets and liabilities:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\n(in thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 60,495 $ 171,319\nCapitalized research and development 75,208 324\nTax credits 66,407 -\nDeferred revenue 59,441 38,810\nLease liabilities 25,382 2,844\nStock compensation 10,296 41,479\nAccrued compensation 3,082 2,961\nIntangible assets 1,523 2,973\nOther 2,636 2,162\nTotal gross deferred tax assets $ 304,470 $ 262,872\nValuation allowance $ (284,626) $ (242,394)\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFixed assets $ (9,878) $ (1,088)\nRight-of-use assets (9,966) -\nState taxes - (19,390)\nTotal gross deferred tax liability $ (19,844) $ (20,478)\nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) $ - $ -\nA valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year period ended September 30, 2023. Such objective evidence limits the ability to consider other subjective evidence such as its projections for future growth. On the basis of this evaluation at September 30, 2023 and 2022, a valuation allowance of $284.6 million and $242.4 million, respectively, has been recorded.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carry forwards of $134.3 million and $491.5 million, respectively. Of the $134.3 million of federal NOL carryforwards, $34.0 million was generated before January 1, 2018 and is subject to the 20-year carryforward period (pre-Tax Act losses). The remaining $100.3 million (post-Tax Act losses) can be carried forward indefinitely but is subject to the 80% taxable income limitation. Of the $491.5 million of state NOL carryforwards $2.9 million can be carried forward indefinitely. The pre-Tax Act U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates through 2041.\nPursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code) Sections 382 and 383, annual use of an entitys NOL and research and development credit carryforwards may be limited if there is a cumulative change in ownership of greater than 50% within a three-year period. The amount of the annual limitation is determined based on the value of the entity immediately prior to the ownership change. Subsequent ownership changes may further affect the limitation in future years. If limited, the related tax asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance. To date, the Company has not completed an analysis pursuant to Sections 382 and 383. Future changes in ownership may occur which could limit the Companys ability to utilize attributes.\nUncertainty in Income Taxes\nThe Company has adopted guidance issued by the FASB that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely-than not and a measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In making this assessment, a company must determine whether it is more-likely-than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based solely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by taxing authorities.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys gross unrecognized tax benefits:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands)\nBeginning balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 3,481 $ - $ -\nGross increase for prior period tax positions 9,495 3,481 -\nGross decrease for prior period tax positions (1,489) - -\nGross increase for current period tax positions 3,049 - -\nEnding balance of unrecognized tax benefits $ 14,536 $ 3,481 $ -\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded income tax expense of $0, $3.5 million and $0 respectively, related to uncertain tax positions. The Companys policy is to recognize potential interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions, if any, in the income tax provision. As of September 30, 2023, the Company has accrued interest and penalties of $0.6 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nIf the unrecognized tax benefit at September 30, 2023 are ultimately recognized, excluding the impact of U.S. Tax benefits netted against deferred taxes that are subject to a valuation allowance, approximately $3.5 million would result in a reduction in the Companys income tax expense and effective tax rate. The Company expects that $3.5 million of its unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various states along with other foreign countries. Due to the presence of NOL carryforwards, all of the income tax years remain open for examination domestically. The Company has not been notified that it is under audit by the Internal Revenue Service or foreign taxing authorities; however, the Company has been notified of an income tax examination by the state of California. There are no other audits in any other jurisdictions.\nNOTE 12. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company sponsors a defined contribution retirement plan which is under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code and is designed to adhere to ERISA Fiduciary standards. Substantially all of the Companys employees are eligible to participate this plan. Under the terms of the plan, an eligible employee may elect to contribute a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis, subject to federal statutory limitations. The plan allows for a discretionary match in an amount up to 100% of each participants first 3% of compensation contributed plus 50% of each participants next 2% of compensation contributed.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company recorded expenses for the matching contributions under this plan of $2.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nThe Company also provides certain employee benefit plans, including those which provide health and life insurance benefits to employees.\nNOTE 13. LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SALE OF FUTURE ROYALTIES\nOn November 9, 2022, the Company and Royalty Pharma entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma agreed to pay up to $410.0 million in cash to the Company in consideration for the Companys future royalty interest in olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) originally developed by the Company and licensed to Amgen in 2016 under the Olpasiran Agreement.\nPursuant to the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront and agreed to pay up to an additional $160.0 million in aggregate one-time milestone payments due if and when the following milestone events occur: (i) $50.0 million on completion of enrollment in the OCEAN Phase 3 clinical trial for olpasiran, (ii) $50.0 million upon receipt of FDA approval of olpasiran for an approved indication (reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, or coronary heart disease death in adults with established cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a)), and (iii) $60.0 million upon Royalty Pharmas receipt of at least $70.0 million of royalty payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement in any single calendar year.\nIn consideration for the payment of the foregoing amounts under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.\nThe Company has evaluated the terms of the Royalty Pharma Agreement and concluded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance that the Company accounted for the transaction as debt and the funding of $250.0 million from Royalty Pharma was recorded as a liability related to the sale of future royalties on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not obligated to repay this upfront funding received under the Royalty Pharma Agreement. This liability is amortized over the expected repayment term using an effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. The interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of forecasted net revenues which affects the repayment timing and ultimate amount of repayment. The Company will evaluate the effective interest rate periodically based on its current revenue forecasts utilizing the prospective method. For 2023, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense of $18.3 million, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\nNOTE 14. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\n(in thousands, except per share amounts)\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. $ (205,275) $ (176,063) $ (140,848)\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average basic shares outstanding 106,750 105,426 103,745\nEffect of dilutive securities - - -\nWeighted-average diluted shares outstanding 106,750 105,426 103,745\nBasic earnings per share $ (1.92) $ (1.67) $ (1.36)\nDiluted earnings per share $ (1.92) $ (1.67) $ (1.36)\nPotentially dilutive securities representing approximately 4,053,000, 3,885,000 and 2,063,000 shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn October 30, 2023, the Company entered into an Assignment and Consent Agreement with Janssen, whereby, the Company consented to the assignment of the Janssen License Agreement to GSK, which assignment shall be effective upon the receipt of certain anti-trust approvals."
