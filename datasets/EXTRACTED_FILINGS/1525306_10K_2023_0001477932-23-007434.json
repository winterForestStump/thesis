Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national, and local general economic and market conditions; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; change in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; the risk of foreign currency exchange rate; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nAlthough the forward-looking statements in this Report reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.\nOverview\nFirst America Resources Corporation is a Nevada corporation formed on May 10, 2010, with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd., Sparks, Nevada 89434.

It is anticipated we will acquire FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a business owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, or another operating company, depending upon completion of audit and preparation of required filing on Form 8-K, which we currently hope to complete in the next 12 months but may take longer than such currently anticipated dates.\nFAMCe in Morris, IL is an international scrap metal company specializing in recycling of non-ferrous and electronic material and has become one large exporter of scrap metal in the Midwest. FAMCe is operating a business branch in Fort Worth, Texas since November 2014 and operating the Georgia branch since January 2016.

There were no foreign currency translation effects on our financial presentation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30,\nAt June 30,\nCurrent Ratio\n972.76\n158.47\nCash\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nWorking Capital\n$ 97,126\n$ 15,747\nTotal Assets\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nTotal Liabilities\n$ 229,033\n$ 229,033\nTotal Equity\n$ (131,807 )\n$ (213,186 )\nTotal Debt/Equity\n-1.74\n-1.07\nCurrent Ratio = Current Asset / Current Liabilities\nWorking Capital = Current asset - Current Liabilities\nTotal Debt / Equity = Total Loans from Officers / Total Shareholders' Equity\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $97,226 at June 30, 2023 and working capital of $97,126. There were total liabilities of $229,033 at June 30, 2023. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $15,847 at June 30, 2022 and negative working capital of $15,747. There were total liabilities of $229,033 at June 30, 2022.\nUntil we generate more operating revenues or receive other financing, all our costs, which we will incur irrespective of our business development activities, including bank service fees and those costs associated with SEC requirements associated with staying public, will be funded by Jian Li, our President and Director. Mr. Li is not obligated to pay these costs and any costs advanced will be treated as a demand loan with to be agreed interest. These costs are estimated to be less than $50,000 annually until we close our potential acquisition. If we fail to meet these requirements, we will be unable to secure a qualification for quotation of our securities on the over the counter bulletin board, or if we have secured a qualification, may lose the qualification and our securities would no longer trade on the over the counter bulletin board. Further, if we fail to meet these obligations and as a consequence, we fail to satisfy our SEC reporting obligations, investors will now own stock in a company that does not provide the disclosure available in quarterly and annual reports filed with the SEC and investors may have increased difficulty in selling their stock as we will be non-reporting.\nAt June 30, 2023, we owe Mr. Li an aggregate of $228,933 on these loans, which are oral and bear no interest, due upon demand.\nAfter our potential acquisition, we may still need to secure additional debt or equity funding. We do not have any plans or specific agreements for new sources of funding, except for the anticipated loans from management as described above.\nOur lack of revenues and cash raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if we are unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing we may be required to cease or curtail our operations.\nThe Companys lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot required. Item 8. Financial Statements\nFirst America Resources Corporation\nAudited Financial Statements\nAs of June 30, 2023, and 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Deficit\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo: Board of Director and shareholders,\nFirst American Resources Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of First America Resources Corporation (the Company) as of June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the years ended June 30, 2023, and June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years ended June 30, 2023 and June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note E to the financial statements, the Companys continuing operating losses and accumulated deficit raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans are also described in Note E. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Victor Mokuolu, CPA PLLC\nPCAOB ID: 6771\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2022.\nHouston, Texas\nOctober 06, 2023\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nBALANCE SHEET\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nTotal Current Assets\n97,226\n15,847\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$ 100\n$ 100\nTotal Current Liabilities\nLong Term Liabilities:\nLoan from Officers\n228,933\n228,933\nTotal Liabilities\n229,033\n229,033\nStockholders' Deficit:\nCommon stock, $0.001 par value; 500,000,000 shares authorized;\n7,964,090 shares issued and outstanding\n7,964\n7,964\nAdditional paid-in capital\n291,360\n190,860\nAccumulated deficit\n(431,131 )\n(412,010 )\nTotal stockholders' deficit\n(131,807 )\n(213,186 )\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nRevenues\n$ -\n$ -\nCost of Goods Sold\n-\n-\nGross Profit\n-\n-\nOperating Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n19,121\n17,203\nTotal Operating Expenses\n19,121\n17,203\nOperating Loss\n(19,121 )\n(17,203 )\nOther income\nInvestment income\n-\n-\nTotal Other Income\n-\n-\nLoss before income taxes\n(19,121 )\n(17,203 )\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\nNet Loss\n$ (19,121 )\n$ (17,203 )\nNet Loss per Common Share- Basic and Diluted\n$ (0.00 )\n$ (0.00 )\nWeighted Average Shares Outstanding\n7,964,090\n7,964,090\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nAdditional\nCommon Stock\nPaid-in\nAccumulated\nShares\nAmount\nCapital\nDeficit\nTotal\nBalance, June 30, 2021\n7,964,090\n$ 7,964\n$ 190,860\n$ (394,807 )\n$ (195,983 )\nNet Loss\n-\n-\n-\n(17,203 )\n(17,203 )\nBalance, June 30, 2022\n7,964,090\n7,964\n190,860\n(412,010 )\n(213,186 )\nNet Loss / Cash Investment\n100,500\n(19,121 )\n81,379\nBalance, June 30, 2023\n7,964,090\n$ 7,964\n$ 291,360\n$ (431,131 )\n$ (131,807 )\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nSTATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nOperating Activities:\nNet loss\n$ (19,121 )\n$ (17,203 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities:\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nIncrease (decrease) in accounts payable\nNet cash used in operating activities\n(19,121 )\n(17,203 )\nInvesting Activities:\nNet cash used in investing activities\n-\n-\nFinancing Activities:\nAdditional Paid in Capital\n100,500\nLoans from shareholders\n-\n20,000\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n100,500\n20,000\nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n81,379\n2,797\nCash and cash equivalents, beginning of period\n15,847\n13,050\nCash and cash equivalents, end of period\n$ 97,226\n$ 15,847\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash paid for:\nInterest\n$ -\n$ -\nTaxes\n$ -\n$ -\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE A - BUSINESS DESCRIPTION\nFirst America Resources Corporation (the Company) formerly known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on May 10, 2010 with registered address at 1955 Baring Blvd., Sparks, NV 89434. First America Resources Corporation has its mailing address at 1000 E. Armstrong Street, Morris IL 60450.\nThe Company was previously engaged in selling the lithium-ion batteries and related power supplies that mainly are used in mobile and consumer electronics products, such as readers, DVD players, digital cameras and digital video recorders, communications products, electric-power bikes and mopeds, miner's lamps, electric-power tools, electric-power sources for instruments and meters and other similar electrical equipment that can run on batteries.\nOn February 6, 2013, pursuant to an Agreement between Mr. Keming Li, former CEO/President and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the Issuer), Ms. Guoling Jin, former Treasury and Director of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Ms. Madison Li (the stockholder), of Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc., and Mr. Jian Li (the Purchaser), Mr. Jian Li became the principal stockholder and Chief Executive Officer and Tzongshyan George Sheu the former Vice President, Secretary, and Director of the Company.\nOn March 20th, 2023, the company received a cash infusion of $100,500 from its President, Mr. Jian Li to fully develop its business model of offering real estate and trading options to nascent battery technologies here in the United States. Developments have previously been put on hold due to Geopolitical events and Covid related Shutdowns.\nThe Company also intends to initially purchase already income producing properties or properties that will produce rent income in a short period of time, meaning less than three months. The income will be produced by the rent that we will be receiving because we will be the owners of the properties. In order to finance future real estate investments, we plan to do additional equity financing, and in addition, we plan to sell some of the properties that we will have acquired at a higher price that we paid in order to buy them using the proceeds in order to buy new properties again at opportunistic prices. Therefore, the profits of our operations will be used in order to acquire new properties. Additionally, we are in negotiations with a battery supplier specializing in golf cart and forklift batteries for the sale and distribution in the US Markets which will result in sales revenues.\nInvestment goals\n\u25cf\nInvestment portfolio diversification\n\u25cf\nCapital appreciation\n\u25cf\nA holding period of from four to eight years\nStrategy and target markets\nBattery sales and Distribution\nCurrent negotiations include licensing for the sale and distribution in the US without regional restrictions for the suppliers entire product line of batteries.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE A - BUSINESS DESCRIPTION (CONTINUED)\nReal Estate\nIt is the owners intention to roll in existing property(s) to be used as capital contributions for the purposes of supporting real estate sales and purchases if support of the Investment Goals stated above.\nWe have instructed counsel to prepare an acquisition contract for a commercial property. This property is:\n600 Wissahickon Ave, Cedartown GA\n\u25cf\nDescription: Tract 1 -1.425 Acres, Tract 2 - 2.554 Acres and 72,000SF facility, Tract 3 - 2.724 Acres and 28,000 SF facility totaling 6.703 acres and 100,000 SF industrial facility located in the 2nd District, 4th Section of the City of Cedartown, Polk County, Georgia.\n\u25cf\nStatus: Unoccupied, for rent.\n\u25cf\nAnticipated Mortgage: Owned Outright\n\u25cf\nOwner: Value Trade, LLC\n\u25cf\nCurrent Value: $250,000\n\u25cf\nCurrent Mortgage Debt: Zero\nWe are refocusing our intention initially on acquiring similar properties. However, our ability to do so will depend upon our ability to secure additional equity financing and, if necessary or appropriate, mortgage financing on these properties. We will not acquire any property unless we believe the property will generate sufficient cash flow to cover all operating costs, including mortgage payments.\nGoing Concern and Plan of Operation\nThe Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not earned any profit from operations to date. These conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issuance of these financial statements. These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. However, on March 20th, 2023, the company has received a cash infusion of $100,500 from its President, Mr. Jian Li to fully develop its business model of offering real estate and trading options to nascent battery technologies here in the United States. Developments have previously been put on hold due to Geopolitical events and Covid related Shutdowns.\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Accounting\nThe financial statements reflect the assets, revenues, and expenditures of the Company on the accrual basis of accounting.\nThe Companys fiscal year end is June 30.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and disclosures. Accordingly, actual results could differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain comparable figures have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2023, and 2022, there was $ 97,226 and $ 15,847 in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. On March 20, 2023, the company received a cash infusion of $100,500 from its President, Mr. Jian Li to fully develop its business model of offering real estate options to nascent battery technologies here in the United States.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for stock issued for services using the fair value method. Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Common Share\nThe Company computes per share amounts in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of basic and diluted EPS.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing the net income (loss) available to Common Shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding during the periods.\nAs of June 30, 2023, and 2022, the Company only issued one type of shares, i.e., common shares. There are no other types of securities issued. Accordingly, the diluted and basic net loss per common share is the same.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized in accordance with ASC 606. The Company performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The Company applies the five-step model to arrangements that meet the definition of a contract under Topic 606, including when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. At contract inception, once the contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, the Company evaluates the goods or services promised within each contract related performance obligation and assesses whether each promised good or service is distinct. The Company recognizes as revenue, the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company had zero revenue for the fiscal years ended at June 30, 2023 and 2022.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of Goods Sold included the purchase cost of the product sold, freight and shipping expense, custom fees, and merchant account fees.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, there was no Cost of Goods Sold recorded.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of selling, general and administrative expenses, mainly accounting and auditing fees, legal fees, SEC filing fees, and other professional fees.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred $ 19,121 and $ 17,203 operating expenses, respectively.\nOperating Leases\nAfter February 6, 2013, the Company moved to the new address located at 1000 E. Armstrong St., Morris, IL 60450. There was no lease signed between the Company and the property owner, Jian Li, who is also the majority shareholder of the Company.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE B - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIncome Tax\nIncome taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes. Deferred taxes are recognized for differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The differences in asset and liability basis relate primarily to organization and start-up costs (use of different methods and periods to calculate deduction). Deferred taxes are also recognized for operating losses and tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes. The deferred tax assets and/or liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences, which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled. The components of the deferred tax asset and liability are classified as current and concurrent based on their characteristics. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets based on managements projection of the sufficiency of future taxable income to realize the assets. The Company policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02). This guidance requires an entity to recognize lease liabilities and a right-of-use asset for all leases on the balance sheet and to disclose key information about the entitys leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after the date of initial adoption, with an option to elect to use certain transition relief. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with earlier adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nNOTE C - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nCommon Shares Issued to Executive and Non-Executive Officers and Directors\nAs of June 30, 2023, total 6,388,010 shares were issued to officers and directors. Please see the table below for details:\nName\nTitle\nShare\nQTY\nDate\n% of Common\nShare\nJian Li\nCEO & President\n6,388,010\n2/6/2013 & 11/27/2013\n80.21\n%\n________\n*The percentage of common shares was based on the total outstanding shares of 7,964,090 as of June 30, 2023.\nLoans to Officer/Director\nFrom the period of April 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013, the former company officer, Keming Li, loaned $ 25,787 to First America Resources Corporation (formerly known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc.) without interest and without written agreement. The payment term is on demand.\nOn February 6, 2013, Mr. Keming Li sold his shares to Mr. Jian Li, and Mr. Jian Li became the loan holder for all the prior loans advanced by the former officer, Mr. Keming Li. As of March 31, 2013, the total loans from shareholder or officer were $25,787.\nFor the period of April 1, 2013 to June 30, 2018, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $ 121,146 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $15,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE C - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (CONTINUED)\nLoans to Officer/Director (Continued)\nFor the period of July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $22,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $25,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $20,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the total loan outstanding from officer and director Jian Li is $ 228,933.\nNOTE D - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nUnder the Companys Articles of Incorporation dated May 10, 2010, the Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.001.\nOn May 10, 2010, the Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada.\nAs of June 30, 2023, a total of 7,964,090 shares were issued and outstanding.\nNOTE E - GOING CONCERN\nThe Companys activities consist solely of corporate formation, raising capital and attempting to sell products to generate revenues.\nThere is no guarantee that the Company will be able to raise enough capital or generate revenues to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the issue date of these financial statements.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the carrying amounts of recorded assets or the carrying amounts and classification of recorded liabilities that may be required should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the Company had no revenues, working capital of $97,126 and an accumulated deficit of $431,131.\nThe Companys lack of operating history and financial resources raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans are to acquire FAMCe (formerly known as First America Metal Corporation), a company owned primarily by Mr. Jian Li, or another operating company. The financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and if the Company is unable to generate significant revenue or secure financing, then the Company may be required to cease or curtail its operations. However, on March 20th, 2023, the company received a cash infusion of $100,500 from its President, Mr. Jian Li to fully develop its business model of offering real estate and trading options to nascent battery technologies here in the United States. Developments have previously been put on hold due to Geopolitical events and Covid related Shutdowns.\nNOTE F - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company has a net operating loss carried forward of $431,099 available to offset taxable income in future years. A net operating loss can be carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80 percent of taxable income in any one year . The amounts reported prior was an estimate prior to filing the return and is now being trued up based on the actual NOL now that the return is filed.\nFIRST AMERICA RESOURCES CORPORATION\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJUNE 30, 2023 AND 2022\nNOTE F - INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)\nThe income tax benefit has been computed by applying the weighted average income tax rates of the United States (federal and state rates) of 21% to the net loss before income taxes calculated for each jurisdiction for the years ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The tax effect of the significant temporary differences, which comprise future tax assets and liabilities, are as follows:\nIncome tax recovery at statutory rate\n$ 4,015\n$ 3,613\nValuation allowance change\n$ (4,015 )\n$ (3,613 )\nProvision for income taxes\n$ -\n$ -\nThe significant components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities at June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, are as follows:\nNet operating loss carried forward\n$ 90,537\n$ 86,515\nValuation allowance\n$ (90,537 )\n$ (86,515 )\nNet deferred income tax asset\n$ -\n$ - Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Companys Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of June 30, 2023. Based upon such evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of June 30, 2023, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. This conclusion by the Companys Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer does not relate to reporting periods after June 30, 2023.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2023 based on the framework stated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, due to our financial situation, we will be implementing further internal controls as we become operative so as to fully comply with the standards set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate due to change in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBased on its evaluation as of June 30, 2023, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness relates to the following:\n1.\nAccounting and Finance Personnel Weaknesses - Our current accounting staff is relatively small and we do not have the required infrastructure of meeting the higher demands of being a U.S. public company. This material weakness also relates to a lack of personnel with expertise in preparing financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, in addition to the small size of the staff.\n2.\nLack of Internal Audit Function - We lack sufficient resources to perform the internal audit function.\n3.\nLack of Audit Committee- We lack a formal audit committee\nIn order to mitigate these material weaknesses to the fullest extent possible, the Company continues to study the implementation of additional internal controls over accounting and financial reporting.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2023, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information\nNone.\nPART III Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nDirectors and Officers\nThe board of directors elects our executive officers annually. A majority vote of the directors who are in office is required to fill vacancies.

Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nThe following tables set forth the ownership, as of the date of this prospectus, of our common stock by each person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding common stock, our directors, and our executive officers and directors as a group. To the best of our knowledge, the person named has sole voting and investment power with respect to such shares, except as otherwise noted. There are not any pending or anticipated arrangements that may cause a change in control.\nThe information presented below regarding beneficial ownership of our voting securities has been presented in accordance with the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not necessarily indicative of ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, a person is deemed to be a \"beneficial owner\" of a security if that person has or shares the power to vote or direct the voting of the security or the power to dispose or direct the disposition of the security. A person is deemed to own beneficially any security as to which such person has the right to acquire sole or shared voting or investment power within 60 days through the conversion or exercise of any convertible security, warrant, option or other right. More than one person may be deemed to be a beneficial owner of the same securities. The percentage of beneficial ownership by any person as of a particular date is calculated by dividing the number of shares beneficially owned by such person, which includes the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days, by the sum of the number of shares outstanding as of such date plus the number of shares as to which such person has the right to acquire voting or investment power within 60 days. Consequently, the denominator used for calculating such percentage may be different for each beneficial owner. Except as otherwise indicated below and under applicable community property laws, we believe that the beneficial owner of our common stock listed below has sole voting and investment power with respect to the shares shown. The business address of the shareholder is 1000 East Armstrong Street, Morris, IL 60450.\nName\nNumber of\nShares of\nCommon stock\nPercentage\nJian Li\n6,388,010\n80.21 %\nAll executive officers and directors as a group [1 person]\n6,388,010\n80.21 %\nThis table is based upon information derived from our stock records. Unless otherwise indicated in the footnotes to this table and subject to community property laws where applicable, the shareholder named in this table has sole or shared voting and investment power with respect to the shares indicated as beneficially owned. Except as set forth above, applicable percentages are based upon 7,964,090 shares of common stock outstanding as of June 30, 2023. Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nLoans from Officer/Shareholder\nFrom the period of April 1, 2012 to February 28, 2013, the former companys officer, Keming Li, loaned $25,787 to First America Resources Corporation (formerly known as Golden Oasis New Energy Group, Inc.) without interest and without written agreement. The payment term is on demand.\nOn February 6, 2013, Mr. Keming Li sold his shares to Mr. Jian Li, and Mr. Jian Li became the loan holder for all the prior loans advanced by the former officer, Mr. Keming Li. As of March 31, 2013, the total loans from shareholder or officer was $25,787.\nFor the period of April 1, 2013 to June 30, 2018, the officer and shareholder Jian Li additionally loaned $121,146 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $15,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $22,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $25,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nFor the period of July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the officer and director Jian Li additionally loaned $20,000 to the Company for continually operating of the business.\nAs of June 30, 2023, the total loan outstanding from officer and director Jian Li is $ 228,933.\nDirector Independence\nOur board of directors has determined that we do not have a board member that qualifies as independent as the term is used in Item 7(d)(3)(iv)(B) of Schedule 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and as defined by Rule 4200(a)(15) of the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nBoyle CPA, LLC was our independent auditor for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Due to the 5 year limit of engagement per the PCAOB, we had to change our auditor to Victor Mokuolu, CPA PLLC. He was our independent auditor for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The following table shows the fees paid or accrued by us for the audit and other services provided by both auditors for fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nAudit Fees\n$ 12,500\n$ 12,000\nAudit-Related Fees\n-\n-\nTax Fees\n-\n-\nAll Other Fees\n-\n-\nTotal\n$ 12,500\n$ 12,000\nAs defined by the SEC, (i) audit fees are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for the audit of our annual financial statements and review of financial statements included in our Form 10-Q and 10-K, or for services that are normally provided by the accountant in connection with statutory and regulatory filings or engagements for those fiscal years; (ii) audit-related fees are fees for assurance and related services by our principal accountant that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under audit fees; (iii) tax fees are fees for professional services rendered by our principal accountant for tax compliance, tax advice, and tax planning; and (iv) all other fees are fees for products and services provided by our principal accountant, other than the services reported under audit fees, audit-related fees, and tax fees.\nUnder applicable SEC rules, the Audit Committee is required to pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors in order to ensure that they do not impair the auditors independence. The SECs rules specify the types of non-audit services that an independent auditor may not provide to its audit client and establish the Audit Committees responsibility for administration of the engagement of the independent auditors. Until such time as we have an Audit Committee in place, the Board of Directors will pre-approve the audit and non-audit services performed by the independent auditors.\nConsistent with the SECs rules, the Audit Committee Charter requires that the Audit Committee review and pre-approve all audit services and permitted non-audit services provided by the independent auditors to us or any of our subsidiaries. The Audit Committee may delegate pre-approval authority to a member of the Audit Committee and if it does, the decisions of that member must be presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.
