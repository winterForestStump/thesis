    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview of the Trust and the Shares\nGrayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (formerly known as Horizen Investment Trust) (the Trust) is a Delaware Statutory Trust that was formed on July 3, 2018 by the filing of the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the provisions of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act.\nThe Trusts purpose is to hold Horizen (ZEN). Horizen, an alternative software implementation of Bitcoin, was created in 2017 by a group that forked Zclassic, which is a clone of Zcash. Although Horizen is similar to Bitcoin, there are several key differences between the Horizen Network and the Bitcoin network. Historically, the fundamental difference between Bitcoin and Horizen was that Horizen offered selective privacy-preserving features. However, Horizen implemented an update in September 2023 that removed many of these privacy preserving features, as described below. In addition, Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 algorithm, which is preferred for parallel processing, but is also easily used to build application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) to mine the network more efficiently. In contrast, Horizen employs the Equihash algorithm. The Equihash algorithm relies on different technology than the SHA-256 algorithm and does not require miners to have access to ASICs, which are expensive, and therefore results in less centralized mining hash power. Horizen has a current block size of 2MB, compared to the variable block size of the Bitcoin network, which has a limit of approximately 4MB. Horizen blocks are also generated every 2.5 minutes, which is approximately four times faster than Bitcoins block production. Horizen halvings also occur every 840,000 blocks, unlike Bitcoins halvings that occur every 210,000 blocks. The Horizen mining difficulty is also roughly one-millionth of Bitcoins, making it easier to mine blocks and earn rewards. Additionally, Horizen and Bitcoin both have a maximum supply of 21 million coins. Horizen has a current circulating supply of approximately 14.2 million coins, which is less than Bitcoins current circulating supply of approximately 19.5 million coins. As of September 30, 2023, the 24-hour trading volume of Horizen and Bitcoin were approximately $5.8 million and $1.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the aggregate market value of Horizen was $110.4 million, as compared to the $525.9 billion aggregate value of Bitcoin. As of September 30, 2023, ZEN was the 182nd largest digital asset by market capitalization, as tracked by CoinMarketCap.com.\nThe Horizen Network is one of a number of projects intended to enhance blockchain technology. One of the Horizen Networks primary enhancements of the blockchain was to add additional layers of confidentiality to traditional blockchain infrastructure so that users could engage in transactions and selectively disclose details related to those transactions. ZEN accomplished this level of confidentiality by using novel cryptographic protocols called Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge (zk-SNARKs) to protect both the amount and the sender and recipient of the transaction. The result was a confidential transaction known as a shielded transaction, which was distinct from a public transaction on the Horizen Network, known as an unshielded transaction. From the inception of the Horizen Network through September 30, 2022, approximately 22% of Horizen transactions had been unshielded, approximately 4% involved one party utilizing a shielded address, and approximately 74% involved both parties utilizing a shielded address. However, in September 2023, Horizen implemented an update intended to deprecate these privacy shields, with the intent of causing it to no longer be considered a privacy coin, and, following the update, the Horizen Network will no longer support transactions from unshielded addresses to shielded addresses. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 88% of Horizen transactions had been unshielded, approximately 11% involved one party utilizing a shielded address, and approximately 1% involved both parties utilizing a shielded address. See -Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market for additional information on the Horizen Networks historical selective privacy-preserving features and recent upgrades.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Trust holds approximately 4.2% of the ZEN in circulation. The size of the Trusts position does not itself enable the Sponsor or the Trust to participate in or otherwise influence the development of the Horizen Network. As a decentralized digital asset network, the Horizen Network consists of several stakeholders, including core developers of ZEN, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, of which the Trust is only one constituent. Furthermore, in contrast to other protocols in which token holders participate in the governance of the network, ownership of ZEN confers no such rights.\nOn January 11, 2019, the Trust changed its name from Horizen Investment Trust to Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) by filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Certificate of Trust with the Delaware Secretary of State. The Trust issues common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (Shares), which represent ownership in the Trust, on a periodic basis to certain accredited investors within the meaning of Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) in exchange for deposits of ZEN. The Shares are quoted on OTC Markets Group Inc.s OTCQX\u00ae Best Market (OTCQX) under the ticker symbol HZEN.\nGrayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor and administrator of the Trust (the Sponsor), Delaware Trust Company is the trustee of the Trust (the Trustee), Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company is the transfer agent of the Trust (in such capacity, the Transfer Agent) and Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC is the custodian of the Trust (the Custodian).\nThe Trust issues Shares only in one or more blocks of 100 Shares (a block of 100 Shares is called a Basket) to certain authorized participants (Authorized Participants) from time to time. Baskets are offered in exchange for ZEN. At this time, the Sponsor is not operating a redemption program for the Shares and therefore Shares are not redeemable by the Trust. Due to the lack of an ongoing redemption program as well as price volatility, trading volume and closings of Digital Asset Exchanges due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, there can be no assurance that the value of the Shares will reflect the value of the Trusts ZEN, less the Trusts\nexpenses and other liabilities, and the Shares may trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trusts ZEN, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities.\nThe U.S. dollar value of a Basket of Shares at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the trade date of a creation order is equal to the Basket Amount, which is the number of ZEN required to create a Basket of Shares, multiplied by the Reference Rate Price, which is a volume-weighted average price in U.S. dollars for the immediately preceding 24-hour period derived from data collected from Digital Asset Exchanges trading ZEN selected by the Reference Rate Provider as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, and included in the CoinDesk Horizen Reference Rate (the Reference Rate), on each business day. The Reference Rate Price is calculated using non-GAAP methodology and is not used in the Trusts financial statements. See -Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price. On June 16, 2023, the Reference Rate Provider removed Binance.US from the Reference Rate due to Binance.USs announcement that the exchange was suspending U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawals and planned to delist its U.S. dollar trading pairs, and did not add any Constituent Exchanges as part of its review. As a result of this removal, there were no longer sufficient Constituent Exchanges for the Reference Rate Provider to continue producing the Reference Rate pursuant to the Constituent Exchange selection methodology described in -Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Constituent Exchange Selection below. If the Reference Rate becomes unavailable, the Sponsor employs an alternative method to determine the Reference Rate Price under the cascading set of rules set forth in -Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Determination of the Reference Rate Price When Reference Rate Price is Unavailable below. Effective June 20, 2023, CoinDesk Indices, Inc. no longer determines the Reference Rate Price, and the Reference Rate Price is the price set by Coin Metrics Real-Time Rate (the Secondary Reference Rate) as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date (the Secondary Reference Rate Price). The Secondary Reference Rate Price is a real-time reference rate price, calculated using trade data from constituent markets selected by Coin Metrics, Inc. (the Secondary Reference Rate Provider). Effective June 20, 2023, any references to the Reference Rate Price in this Annual Report refers to the Secondary Reference Rate Price set by the Secondary Reference Rate selected by the Secondary Reference Rate Provider.\nThe Basket Amount is determined by dividing (x) the number of ZEN owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date, after deducting the number of ZEN representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust (converted using the Reference Rate Price at such time, and carried to the eighth decimal place), by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time (with the quotient so obtained calculated to one one-hundred-millionth of one ZEN (i.e., carried to the eighth decimal place)), and multiplying such quotient by 100.\nThe Shares are neither interests in nor obligations of the Sponsor or the Trustee.\nThe Sponsor maintains an Internet website at www.grayscale.com/crypto-products/grayscale-horizen-trust/, through which the registrants annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are made available free of charge after they have been filed or furnished to the SEC. Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SECs EDGAR database at www.sec.gov.\nThe contents of the websites referred to above and any websites referred to herein are not incorporated into this filing. Further, our references to the URLs for these websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.\nInvestment Objective\nThe Trusts investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on ZEN per Share) to reflect the value of ZEN held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Reference Rate Price, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of ZEN held by the Trust, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial.\nIn the event the Shares trade at a substantial premium, investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX will pay substantially more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares in the private placement. The value of the Shares may not reflect the value of the Trusts ZEN, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities, for a variety of reasons, including the holding period under Rule 144 for Shares purchased in the private placement, the lack of an ongoing redemption program, any halting of creations by the Trust, ZEN price volatility, trading volumes on, or closures of, exchanges where digital assets trade due to fraud, failure, security breaches or otherwise, and the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the global exchange market for trading ZEN. As a result, the Shares may continue to trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trusts ZEN, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities, and the Trust may be unable to meet its investment objective for the foreseeable future.\nFor example, from October 19, 2021 to September 30, 2023, the maximum premium of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX over the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 127%, the average premium was 20%, the maximum discount of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX below the value of the Trust's Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 54%, and the average discount was 20%. The closing price of the Shares, as quoted on OTCQX at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day between October 19, 2021 and September 30, 2023, has been quoted at a discount on 342 days. As of September 29, 2023, the last business day of the period, the Trusts Shares were quoted on OTCQX at a premium of 11% to the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per\nShare. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Secondary Market Trading.\nWhile an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in ZEN, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to ZEN. A substantial direct investment in ZEN may require expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the acquisition, security and safekeeping of the ZEN and may involve the payment of substantial fees to acquire such ZEN from third-party facilitators through cash payments of U.S. dollars. Because the value of the Shares is correlated with the value of the ZEN held by the Trust, it is important to understand the investment attributes of, and the market for, ZEN.\nShares purchased in the private placement are restricted securities that may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws and any such transaction must be approved in advance by the Sponsor. In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act, including the requisite holding period thereunder, and any other applicable laws have been met. Any attempt to sell the Shares without the approval of the Sponsor in its sole discretion will be void ab initio. See -Description of the Shares-Transfer Restrictions for more information.\nPursuant to Rule 144, the minimum holding period for Shares purchased in the private placement is six months.\nThe Trusts ZEN are carried, for financial statement purposes, at fair value, as required by the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The Trust determines the fair value of ZEN based on the price provided by the Digital Asset Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The net asset value of the Trust determined on a GAAP basis is referred to in this Annual Report as NAV. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Principal Market and Fair Value Determination for more information on the Trusts principal market selection.\nThe Trust uses the Reference Rate Price to calculate its Digital Asset Holdings, which is the aggregate value, expressed in U.S. dollars, of the Trusts assets (other than U.S. dollars, other fiat currency, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency), less the U.S. dollar value of the Trusts expenses and other liabilities calculated in the manner set forth under -Valuation of ZEN and Determination of Digital Asset Holdings. Digital Asset Holdings per Share is calculated by dividing Digital Asset Holdings by the number of Shares currently outstanding. Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share are not measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Digital Asset Holdings is not intended to be a substitute for the Trusts NAV calculated in accordance with GAAP, and Digital Asset Holdings per Share is not intended to be a substitute for the Trusts NAV per Share calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nAt this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program for Shares and therefore Shares are not redeemable by the Trust. In addition, the Trust may halt creations, including for extended periods of time, for a variety of reasons, including in connection with forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. As a result, Authorized Participants are not able to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share, which may cause the Shares to trade at a substantial premium over, or a substantial discount to, the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nSubject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. Because the Trust does not believe that the SEC would, at this time, entertain an application for the waiver of rules needed in order to operate an ongoing redemption program, the Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval from the SEC to operate an ongoing redemption program. Even if such relief is sought in the future, no assurance can be given as to the timing of such relief or that such relief will be granted. If such relief is granted and the Sponsor approves a redemption program, the Shares will be redeemable in accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement and the relevant Participant Agreement. Although the Sponsor cannot predict with certainty what effect, if any, the operation of a redemption program would have on the trading price of the Shares, a redemption program would allow Authorized Participants to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities created when the market value of the Shares deviates from the value of the Trusts ZEN, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities, which may have the effect of reducing any premium or discount at which the Shares trade on OTCQX over or below such value, respectively, which at times has been substantial.\nFor a discussion of risks relating to the deviation in the trading price of the Shares from the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, see Item 1A. Risk Factors\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in the Shares speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below and should be read in conjunction with the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Trusts financial statements and related notes thereto, and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding the Shares.

All other capitalized terms used, but not defined, herein have the meanings given to them in the Trust Agreement.\nExtreme volatility of trading prices that many digital assets, including ZEN, have experienced in recent periods and may continue to experience, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value;\nThe medium-to-long term value of the Shares is subject to a number of factors relating to the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and to the fundamental investment characteristics of digital assets;\nThe value of the Shares is dependent on the acceptance of Digital Assets, such as ZEN, which represent a new and rapidly evolving industry;\nDigital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital assets;\nRecent developments in the digital asset economy have led to extreme volatility and disruption in digital asset markets, a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem, significant negative publicity surrounding digital assets broadly and market-wide declines in liquidity;\nThe unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Digital Asset Exchanges may adversely affect the value of digital assets and, consequently, the value of the Shares;\nThe value of the Shares relates directly to the value of ZEN held by the Trust, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations;\nBecause of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program, and the Trusts ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Reference Rate Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share;\nThe Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share as a result of the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the Digital Asset Exchange Market;\nShareholders may suffer a loss on their investment if the Shares trade above or below the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share;\nA determination that ZEN or any other digital asset is a security may adversely affect the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust;\nRegulatory changes or actions by the U.S. Congress or any U.S. federal or state agencies may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of ZEN, mining activity or the operation of the Horizen Network or the Digital Asset Markets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares;\nChanges in the policies of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) could adversely impact the value of the Shares;\nRegulatory changes or other events in foreign jurisdictions may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of one or more digital assets, mining activity or the operation of their networks or the Digital Asset Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares;\nAn Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor could be subject to regulation as a money service business or money transmitter, which could result in extraordinary expenses to the Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor and also result in decreased liquidity for the Shares;\nRegulatory changes or interpretations could obligate the Trust or the Sponsor to register and comply with new regulations, resulting in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust;\nThe Trust may be required to disclose information, including information relating to investors, to regulators;\nConflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust;\nThe Sponsors services may be discontinued, which could be detrimental to the Trust;\nIf the Custodian resigns or is removed by the Sponsor, or otherwise, without replacement, it could trigger early termination of the Trust; and\nThe Trust relies on third-party service providers to perform certain functions essential to the affairs of the Trust and the replacement of such service providers could pose a challenge to the safekeeping of the Trusts ZEN and to the operations of the Trust.\nThe following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of the Shares. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but may become material in the future.\nRisk Factors Related to Digital Assets\nThe trading prices of many digital assets, including ZEN, have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so. Extreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of ZEN, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value.\nThe trading prices of many digital assets, including ZEN, have experienced extreme volatility in recent periods and may continue to do so. For instance, following significant increases throughout the majority of 2020, digital asset prices, including ZEN, experienced significant volatility throughout 2021 and 2022.\nThis volatility became extreme in November 2022 when FTX halted customer withdrawals. See -Recent developments in the digital asset economy have led to extreme volatility and disruption in digital asset markets, a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem, significant negative publicity surrounding digital assets broadly and market-wide declines in liquidity. Digital asset prices, including ZEN, have continued to fluctuate widely to date in 2023.\nExtreme volatility in the future, including further declines in the trading prices of ZEN, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value. Furthermore, negative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the digital asset economy may reduce confidence in the digital asset economy and may result in greater volatility in the price of ZEN and other digital assets, including a depreciation in value. The Trust is not actively managed and will not take any actions to take advantage, or mitigate the impacts, of volatility in the price of ZEN. For additional information that quantifies the volatility of ZEN prices and the value of the Shares, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Historical Digital Asset Holdings and ZEN Prices.\nDigital assets such as ZEN were only introduced within the past two decades, and the medium-to-long term value of the Shares is subject to a number of factors relating to the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies and to the fundamental investment characteristics of digital assets.\nDigital assets such as ZEN were only introduced within the past two decades, and the medium-to-long term value of the Shares is subject to a number of factors relating to the capabilities and development of blockchain technologies, such as the recentness of their development, their dependence on the internet and other technologies, their dependence on the role played by users, developers and miners and the potential for malicious activity. For example, the realization of one or more of the following risks could materially adversely affect the value of the Shares:\nDigital asset networks and the software used to operate them are in the early stages of development. Given the recentness of the development of digital asset networks, digital assets may not function as intended and parties may be unwilling to use digital assets, which would dampen the growth, if any, of digital asset networks.\nThe loss or destruction of a private key required to access a digital asset may be irreversible. If a private key is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the owner would be unable to access the digital asset corresponding to that private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the digital asset network.\nDigital asset networks are dependent upon the internet. A disruption of the internet or a digital asset network, such as the Horizen Network, would affect the ability to transfer digital assets, including ZEN, and, consequently, their value.\nThe acceptance of software patches or upgrades by a significant, but not overwhelming, percentage of the users and miners in a digital asset network, such as the Horizen Network, could result in a fork in such networks blockchain, resulting in the operation of multiple separate networks.\nDigital asset mining operations can consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations. Additionally, miners may be forced to cease operations during an electricity shortage or power outage.\nMany digital asset networks face significant scaling challenges and are being upgraded with various features to increase the speed and throughput of digital asset transactions. These attempts to increase the volume of transactions may not be effective.\nThe open-source structure of many digital asset network protocols, such as the protocol for the Horizen Network, means that developers and other contributors are generally not directly compensated for their contributions in maintaining and developing such protocols. As a result, the developers and other contributors of a particular digital asset may lack a financial incentive to maintain or develop the network or may lack the resources to adequately address emerging issues. Alternatively, some developers may be funded by companies whose interests are at odds with other participants in a particular digital asset network. A failure to properly monitor and upgrade the protocol of the Horizen Network could damage that network.\nMoreover, in the past, flaws in the source code for digital assets have been exposed and exploited, including flaws that disabled some functionality for users, exposed users personal information and/or resulted in the theft of users digital assets. The cryptography underlying ZEN could prove to be flawed or ineffective, or developments in mathematics and/or technology, including advances in digital computing, algebraic geometry and quantum computing, could result in such cryptography becoming ineffective. In any of these circumstances, a malicious actor may be able to take the Trusts ZEN, which would adversely affect the value of the Shares. Moreover, functionality of the Horizen Network may be negatively affected such that it is no longer attractive to users, thereby dampening demand for ZEN. Even if another digital asset other than ZEN were affected by similar circumstances, any reduction in confidence in the source code or cryptography underlying digital assets generally could negatively affect the demand for digital assets and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nMoreover, because digital assets, including ZEN, have been in existence for a short period of time and are continuing to develop, there may be additional risks in the future that are impossible to predict as of the date of this Annual Report.\nDigital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry, and the value of the Shares depends on the acceptance of ZEN.\nThe first digital asset, Bitcoin, was launched in 2009. ZEN launched in 2017. In general, digital asset networks, including the Horizen Network and other cryptographic and algorithmic protocols governing the issuance of digital assets represent a new and rapidly evolving industry that is subject to a variety of factors that are difficult to evaluate. For example, the realization of one or more of the following risks could materially adversely affect the value of the Shares:\nZEN is only selectively accepted by retail and commercial outlets, and use of ZEN by consumers remains limited. Banks and other established financial institutions may refuse to process funds for ZEN transactions; process wire transfers to or from Digital Asset Exchanges, ZEN-related companies or service providers; or maintain accounts for persons or entities transacting in ZEN. As a result, the prices of ZEN are largely determined by speculators and miners, thus contributing to price volatility that makes retailers less likely to accept ZEN in the future. While the use of other digital assets, such as Bitcoin, to purchase goods and services from commercial or service businesses is developing, ZEN has not yet been accepted in the same manner due to its infancy and because ZEN has a slightly different purpose than Bitcoin.\nBanks may not provide banking services, or may cut off banking services, to businesses that provide digital asset-related services or that accept digital assets as payment, which could dampen liquidity in the market and damage the public perception of digital assets generally or any one digital asset in particular, such as ZEN, and their or its utility as a payment system, which could decrease the price of digital assets generally or individually.\nCertain privacy-preserving features have been introduced to a number of digital asset networks. ZEN removed some of its privacy features in September 2023. Nevertheless, exchanges or businesses that facilitate transactions in ZEN may be at an increased risk of having banking services cut off if there is a concern its privacy features interfere with the performance of anti-money laundering duties and economic sanctions checks. For example, in September 2022, the Digital Asset Exchange Huobi delisted seven digital assets with privacy preserving features, including ZEN, a move that Huobi explained was in compliance with the latest financial regulations. However, in September 2023, Horizen implemented an update intended to deprecate these privacy shields, with the intent of causing it to no longer be considered a privacy coin, and, following the update, the Horizen Network will no longer support transactions from unshielded addresses to shielded addresses. It is unclear whether the removal of those types of shielded transactions from Horizen would mitigate these concerns by regulators, law enforcement agencies, and other digital asset market participants regarding ZEN.\nUsers, developers and miners may otherwise switch to or adopt certain digital assets at the expense of their engagement with other digital asset networks, which may negatively impact those networks, including the Horizen Network.\nZEN is designed to foster sidechain operations, but it has not been widely adopted even in the context of ZEN transactions. If ZENs capabilities are not more widely utilized, it may struggle to compete with other digital assets.\nHorizens privacy-preserving features may have been seen by some as primary attributes distinguishing ZEN from its competitors. Horizen's upgrade deprecating shielded pools could diminish ZEN's popularity, which could adversely affect the value of ZEN.\nChanges in the governance of a digital asset network may not receive sufficient support from users and miners, which may negatively affect that digital asset networks ability to grow and respond to challenges.\nThe governance of decentralized networks, such as the Horizen Network, is by voluntary consensus and open competition. As a result, there may be a lack of consensus or clarity on the governance of any particular decentralized digital asset network, which may stymie such networks utility and ability to grow and face challenges. The foregoing notwithstanding, the protocols for some decentralized networks, such as the Horizen Network, are informally managed by a group of core developers that propose amendments to the relevant networks source code. Core developers roles evolve over time, largely based on self-determined participation. If a\nsignificant majority of users and miners were to adopt amendments to the Horizen Network based on the proposals of such core developers, the Horizen Network would be subject to new protocols that may adversely affect the value of ZEN.\nAs a result of the foregoing, it may be difficult to find solutions or marshal sufficient effort to overcome any future problems, especially long-term problems, on digital asset networks.\nDigital asset networks face significant scaling challenges and efforts to increase the volume and speed of transactions may not be successful.\nMany digital asset networks face significant scaling challenges due to the fact that public blockchains generally face a tradeoff between security and scalability. One means through which public blockchains achieve security is decentralization, meaning that no intermediary is responsible for securing and maintaining these systems. For example, a greater degree of decentralization generally means a given digital asset network is less susceptible to manipulation or capture. In practice, this typically means that every single node on a given digital asset network is responsible for securing the system by processing every transaction and maintaining a copy of the entire state of the network. As a result, a digital asset network may be limited in the number of transactions it can process by the capabilities of each single fully participating node. Many developers are actively researching and testing scalability solutions for public blockchains that do not necessarily result in lower levels of security or decentralization, such as off-chain payment channels and sharding. Off-chain payment channels would allow parties to transact without requiring the full processing power of a blockchain. Sharding can increase the scalability of a database, such as a blockchain, by splitting the data processing responsibility among many nodes, allowing for parallel processing and validating of transactions.\nIn an effort to increase the volume of transactions that can be processed on a given digital asset network, many digital assets are being upgraded with various features to increase the speed and throughput of digital asset transactions. For example, in August 2017, the Bitcoin network was upgraded with a technical feature known as Segregated Witness that potentially doubles the transactions per second that can be handled on-chain. More importantly, Segregated Witness also enables so-called second layer solutions, such as the Lightning network, or payment channels that greatly increase transaction throughput (i.e., millions of transactions per second). Wallets and intermediaries, or connecting nodes that facilitate payment channels, that support Segregated Witness or Lightning network-like technologies have not seen wide-scale use as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, questions remain regarding Lightning network services, such as its cost and who will serve as intermediaries.\nAs corresponding increases in throughput lag behind growth in the use of digital asset networks, average fees and settlement times may increase considerably. For example, the Bitcoin network has been, at times, at capacity, which has led to increased transaction fees. Since January 1, 2020, Bitcoin transaction fees have increased from $0.28 per Bitcoin transaction, on average, to a high of $60.95 per transaction, on average, on April 20, 2021. As of September 30, 2023, Bitcoin transaction fees stood at $2.10 per Bitcoin transaction, on average. ZEN transaction fees have ranged from $0.0009 on January 1, 2020, to as high as $0.015 on May 12, 2021. As of September 30, 2023, ZEN transaction fees stood at $0.0008 per ZEN transaction, on average. Increased fees and decreased settlement speeds could preclude certain uses for ZEN (e.g., micropayments), and could reduce demand for, and the price of, ZEN, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nThere is no guarantee that any of the mechanisms in place or being explored for increasing the scale of settlement of Horizen Network transactions will be effective, or how long these mechanisms will take to become effective, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nDigital asset networks are developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that certain high-profile contributors will no longer contribute to the network could have an adverse effect on the market price of the related digital asset.\nDigital asset networks are often developed by a diverse set of contributors and the perception that high-profile contributors may no longer contribute to the network may have an adverse effect on the market price of any related digital assets. For example, in June 2017, an unfounded rumor circulated that Ethereum protocol developer Vitalik Buterin had died. Following the rumor, the price of ETH decreased approximately 20% before recovering after Buterin himself dispelled the rumor. Some have speculated that the rumor led to the decrease in the price of ETH. In the event a high-profile contributor to the Horizen Network is perceived as no longer contributing to the Horizen Network due to death, retirement, withdrawal, incapacity, or otherwise, whether or not such perception is valid, it could negatively affect the price of ZEN, which could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nDigital assets may have concentrated ownership and large sales or distributions by holders of such digital assets, or any ability to participate in or otherwise influence a digital assets underlying network, could have an adverse effect on the market price of such digital asset.\nAs of November 2023, the largest 100 ZEN wallets held approximately 58% of the ZEN in circulation. Moreover, it is possible that other persons or entities control multiple wallets that collectively hold a significant number of ZEN, even if they individually only hold a small amount, and it is possible that some of these wallets are controlled by the same person or entity. Because of the\nprivacy-preserving features of the Horizen Network, it is not possible to determine whether such concentration of ownership of ZEN exists. If there is any such concentration of ownership, large sales or distributions by such holders could have an adverse effect on the market price of ZEN.\nIf the digital asset award for mining blocks and transaction fees for recording transactions on the Horizen Network are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, or if certain jurisdictions continue to limit or otherwise regulate mining activities, miners may cease expanding processing power or demand high transaction fees, which could negatively impact the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nIf the digital asset awards for mining blocks or the transaction fees for recording transactions on the Horizen Network are not sufficiently high to incentivize miners, or if certain jurisdictions continue to limit or otherwise regulate mining activities, miners may cease expending processing power to mine blocks and the security of the Horizen Blockchain could be compromised. For example, the realization of one or more of the following risks could materially adversely affect the value of the Shares:\nOver the past several years, digital asset mining operations have evolved from individual users mining with computer processors, graphics processing units and first-generation application specific integrated circuit machines to professionalized mining operations using proprietary hardware or sophisticated machines. If the profit margins of digital asset mining operations are not sufficiently high, including due to an increase in electricity costs, digital asset miners are more likely to immediately sell tokens earned by mining, resulting in an increase in liquid supply of that digital asset, which would generally tend to reduce that digital assets market price.\nA reduction in the processing power expended by miners on the Horizen Network could increase the likelihood of a malicious actor or botnet obtaining control. See -If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Horizen Network, or otherwise obtains control over the Horizen Network through its influence over core developers or otherwise, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Horizen Blockchain to adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.\nMiners have historically accepted relatively low transaction confirmation fees on most digital asset networks. If miners demand higher transaction fees for recording transactions in the Horizen Blockchain or a software upgrade automatically charges fees for all transactions on the Horizen Network, the cost of using ZEN may increase and the marketplace may be reluctant to accept ZEN as a means of payment. Miners may demand higher transaction fees for a variety of reasons,\nincluding to compensate for reduction in the reward received for validating a block as a result of portions of each block reward going to Secure Nodes (10%), Super Nodes (10%) and the Horizen Blockchain Foundation (20%), or as a result of the halving of ZEN creation every four years in accordance with the Horizen Network protocol.\nAlternatively, miners could collude in an anti-competitive manner to reject low transaction fees on the Horizen Network and force users to pay higher fees, thus reducing the attractiveness of the Horizen Network. Higher transaction confirmation fees resulting through collusion or otherwise may adversely affect the attractiveness of the Horizen Network, the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nTo the extent that any miners cease to record transactions that do not include the payment of a transaction fee in mined blocks or do not record a transaction because the transaction fee is too low, such transactions will not be recorded on the Horizen Blockchain until a block is mined by a miner who does not require the payment of transaction fees or is willing to accept a lower fee. Any widespread delays in the recording of transactions could result in a loss of confidence in the digital asset network.\nDigital asset mining operations can consume significant amounts of electricity, which may have a negative environmental impact and give rise to public opinion against allowing, or government regulations restricting, the use of electricity for mining operations. Additionally, miners may be forced to cease operations during an electricity shortage or power outage.\nIn addition, in response to a double-spend attack in June 2018, the team behind ZEN implemented mitigation procedures to make it more computationally and economically expensive to privately mine blocks and later introduce those blocks to the public Horizen Network as the valid Horizen Blockchain. If miners do not believe the transaction confirmation fees on the Horizen Network are adequate to compensate them for such increased computational difficulty and economic expense, they may demand higher transaction fees or cease recording transactions on the Horizen Network, which could result in a loss of confidence in the digital asset network and/or make it less attractive to users, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares of the Trust.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Horizen Network, or otherwise obtains control over the Horizen Network through its influence over core developers or otherwise, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Blockchain to adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.\nIf a malicious actor or botnet (a volunteer or hacked collection of computers controlled by networked software coordinating the actions of the computers) obtains a majority of the processing power on the Horizen Network, it may be able to alter the Blockchain on which transactions in ZEN rely by constructing fraudulent blocks or preventing certain transactions from completing in a timely manner,\nor at all. The malicious actor or botnet could also control, exclude or modify the ordering of transactions. Although the malicious actor or botnet would not be able to generate new tokens or transactions using such control, it could double-spend its own tokens (i.e., spend the same tokens in more than one transaction) and prevent the confirmation of other users transactions for so long as it maintained control. To the extent that such malicious actor or botnet did not yield its control of the processing power on the Horizen Network or the ZEN community did not reject the fraudulent blocks as malicious, reversing any changes made to the Blockchain may not be possible. Further, a malicious actor or botnet could create a flood of transactions in order to slow down the Horizen Network.\nFor example, in August 2020, the Ethereum Classic network was the target of two double-spend attacks by an unknown actor or actors that gained more than 50% of the processing power of the Ethereum Classic network. The attack resulted in reorganizations of the Ethereum Classic Blockchain that allowed the attacker or attackers to reverse previously recorded transactions in excess of over $5.0 million and $1.0 million. Any similar attacks on the Horizen Network could negatively impact the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nMoreover, certain mining pools have exceeded in the past, and may exceed now or in Horizens future, the 50% threshold on the Horizen Network. For example, on June 2, 2018, the Horizen Network was the target of a double-spend attack by an unknown actor that gained more than 50% of the processing power of the Horizen Network. The attack was the result of delayed submission of blocks to the Horizen Network. The team behind ZEN has implemented mitigation procedures to significantly increase the difficulty of attacks of this nature by introducing a penalty for delayed block submissions. The result is that it became more computationally and economically expensive to privately mine blocks and later introduce those blocks to the public Horizen Network as the valid Horizen Blockchain. The failure of these or other mitigating steps, or any future attacks on the Horizen Network, could negatively impact the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares of the Trust.\nA malicious actor may also obtain control over the Horizen Network through its influence over core developers by gaining direct control over a core developer or an otherwise influential programmer. To the extent that the ZEN ecosystem does not grow, the possibility that a malicious actor may be able to obtain control of the processing power on the Horizen Network in this manner will remain heightened.\nA temporary or permanent fork or a clone could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Horizen Network operates using open-source protocols, meaning that any user can download the software, modify it and then propose that the users and miners of ZEN adopt the modification. When a modification is introduced and a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the modification, the change is implemented and the network remains uninterrupted. However, if less than a substantial majority of users and miners consent to the proposed modification, and the modification is not compatible with the software prior to its modification, the consequence would be what is known as a hard fork of the Horizen Network, with one group running the pre-modified software and the other running the modified software. The effect of such a fork would be the existence of two versions of ZEN running in parallel, yet lacking interchangeability. Some users of the original network may harbor ill will toward the new network, and vice versa. A fork may also occur as a result of an unintentional or unanticipated software flaw in the various versions of otherwise compatible software that users run. Such a fork could lead to users and miners abandoning the digital asset with the flawed software. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users and miners could adopt an incompatible version of the digital asset while resisting community-led efforts to merge the two chains. This could result in a permanent fork.\nForks may also occur as a network communitys response to a significant security breach. For example, in July 2016, Ethereum forked into Ethereum and a new digital asset, Ethereum Classic, as a result of the Ethereum network communitys response to a significant security breach. In June 2016, an anonymous hacker exploited a smart contract running on the Ethereum network to syphon approximately $60 million of ETH held by The DAO, a distributed autonomous organization, into a segregated account. In response to the hack, most participants in the Ethereum community elected to adopt a fork that effectively reversed the hack. However, a minority of users continued to develop the original blockchain, referred to as Ethereum Classic with the digital asset on that blockchain now referred to as ETC. ETC now trades on several Digital Asset Exchanges. A fork may also occur as a result of an unintentional or unanticipated software flaw in the various versions of otherwise compatible software that users run. Such a fork could lead to users and miners abandoning the digital asset with the flawed software. It is possible, however, that a substantial number of users and miners could adopt an incompatible version of the digital asset while resisting community-led efforts to merge the two chains. This could result in a permanent fork, as in the case of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic.\nIn addition, many developers have previously initiated hard forks in the Bitcoin blockchain to launch new digital assets, such as Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin Silver and Bitcoin Diamond, as well as the Bitcoin Cash blockchain to launch a new digital asset, Bitcoin Satoshis Vision. To the extent such digital assets compete with Horizen, such competition could impact demand for ZEN and could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nIn principle a fork could change the source code for the Horizen Network, including the source code which limits the supply of ZEN to 21 million. There is no guarantee that the current 21 million supply cap for outstanding ZEN will not be changed. If a fork\nchanging the 21 million supply cap is widely adopted, the limit on the supply of ZEN could be lifted, which could have an adverse impact on the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nFurthermore, a hard fork can lead to new security concerns. For example, when the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks split in July 2016, replay attacks, in which transactions from one network were rebroadcast to nefarious effect on the other network, plagued Ethereum exchanges through at least October 2016. An Ethereum exchange announced in July 2016 that it had lost 40,000 Ethereum Classic, worth about $100,000 at that time, as a result of replay attacks. Similar replay attack concerns occurred in connection with the Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshis Vision networks split in November 2018. Another possible result of a hard fork is an inherent decrease in the level of security due to significant amounts of mining power remaining on one network or migrating instead to the new forked network. After a hard fork, it may become easier for an individual miner or mining pools hashing power to exceed 50% of the processing power of a digital asset network that retained or attracted less mining power, thereby making digital asset networks that rely on proof-of-work more susceptible to attack.\nProtocols may also be cloned. Unlike a fork, which modifies an existing blockchain, and results in two competing networks, each with the same genesis block, a clone is a copy of a protocols codebase, but results in an entirely new blockchain and new genesis block. Tokens are created solely from the new clone network and, in contrast to forks, holders of tokens of the existing network that was cloned do not receive any tokens of the new network. A clone results in a competing network that has characteristics substantially similar to the network it was based on, subject to any changes as determined by the developer(s) that initiated the clone.\nA hard fork may adversely affect the price of ZEN at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, the announcement of a hard fork could lead to increased demand for the pre-fork digital asset, in anticipation that ownership of the pre-fork digital asset would entitle holders to a new digital asset following the fork. The increased demand for the pre-fork digital asset may cause the price of the digital asset to rise. After the hard fork, it is possible the aggregate price of the two versions of the digital asset running in parallel would be less than the price of the digital asset immediately prior to the fork. Furthermore, while the Trust would be entitled to both versions of the digital asset running in parallel, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, determine which version of the digital asset is generally accepted as the Horizen Network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trusts purposes, and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork. Either of these events could therefore adversely impact the value of the Shares. For example, following the DAO hack in July 2016, holders of Ethereum voted on-chain to reverse the hack, effectively causing a hard fork. For the days following the vote, the price of Ethereum rose from $11.65 on July 15, 2016 to $14.66 on July 21, 2016, the day after the first Ethereum Classic block was mined.\nA clone may also adversely affect the price of ZEN at the time of announcement or adoption. For example, on November 6, 2016, Rhett Creighton, a Zcash developer, cloned the Zcash network to launch Zclassic, a substantially identical version of the Zcash network that eliminated the 20% block reward that is distributed to a group of Zcash founders, investors, employees and advisers. For the days following the date the first Zclassic block was mined, the price of ZEC fell from $504.57 on November 5, 2016 to $236.01 on November 7, 2016 in the midst of a broader sell off of ZEC beginning immediately after the Zcash networks launch on October 28, 2016. In addition, in May 2017, a group of community members further forked the Zclassic protocol to develop a fully encrypted privacy platform with additional changes to the economic, governance and technical parameters of the network, which resulted in the Horizen Network. For the days following the date the Horizen Network was launched on May 23, 2017, the price of Zclassic fell from $4.06 on May 23, 2017 to $2.77 on May 27, 2017.\nA future fork in or clone of the Horizen Network could adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate.\nShareholders may not receive the benefits of any forks or airdrops.\nIn addition to forks, a digital asset may become subject to a similar occurrence known as an airdrop. In an airdrop, the promotors of a new digital asset announce to holders of another digital asset that such holders will be entitled to claim a certain amount of the new digital asset for free, based on the fact that they hold such other digital asset.\nShareholders may not receive the benefits of any forks, the Trust may not choose, or be able, to participate in an airdrop, and the timing of receiving any benefits from a fork, airdrop or similar event is uncertain. We refer to the right to receive any such benefit as an Incidental Right and any such virtual currency acquired through an Incidental Right as IR Virtual Currency. There are likely to be operational, tax, securities law, regulatory, legal and practical issues that significantly limit, or prevent entirely, shareholders ability to realize a benefit, through their Shares in the Trust, from any such Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. For instance, the Custodian may not agree to provide access to the IR Virtual Currency. In addition, the Sponsor may determine that there is no safe or practical way to custody the IR Virtual Currency, or that trying to do so may pose an unacceptable risk to the Trusts holdings in ZEN, or that the costs of taking possession and/or maintaining ownership of the IR Virtual Currency exceed the benefits of owning the IR Virtual Currency. Additionally, laws, regulation or other factors may prevent shareholders from benefitting from the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency even if there is a safe and practical way to custody and secure the IR Virtual Currency. For example, it may be illegal to sell or otherwise dispose of the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency, or there may not be a suitable market into which the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency can be sold (immediately after the fork or airdrop, or ever). The Sponsor may also determine, in consultation\nwith its legal advisers, that the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency is, or is likely to be deemed, a security under federal or state securities laws. In such a case, the Sponsor would irrevocably abandon, as of any date on which the Trust creates Shares, such Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency if holding it would have an adverse effect on the Trust and it would not be practicable to avoid such effect by disposing of the Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency in a manner that would result in shareholders receiving more than insignificant value thereof. In making such a determination, the Sponsor expects to take into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of a security under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Courts decisions in the Howey and Reves cases, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws.\nThe Trust has informed the Custodian that it is irrevocably abandoning, as of any date on which the Trust creates Shares, any Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such date and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such date. In order to avert abandonment of an Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency, the Trust will send a notice to the Custodian of its intention to retain such Incidental Right or IR Virtual Currency. The Sponsor intends to evaluate each future fork or airdrop on a case-by-case basis in consultation with the Trusts legal advisers, tax consultants and Custodian. Any inability to recognize the economic benefit of a hard fork or airdrop could adversely affect the value of the Shares. See Item 1. Business-Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency.\nIn the event of a hard fork of the Horizen Network, the Sponsor will, if permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine which network should be considered the appropriate network for the Trusts purposes, and in doing so may adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nIn the event of a hard fork of the Horizen Network, the Sponsor will, as permitted by the terms of the Trust Agreement, use its discretion to determine, in good faith, which peer-to-peer network, among a group of incompatible forks of the Horizen Network, is generally accepted as the Horizen Network and should therefore be considered the appropriate network for the Trusts purposes. The Sponsor will base its determination on a variety of then relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the Sponsors beliefs regarding expectations of the core developers of ZEN, users, services, businesses, miners and other constituencies, as well as the actual continued acceptance of, mining power on, and community engagement with, the Horizen Network. There is no guarantee that the Sponsor will choose the digital asset that is ultimately the most valuable fork, and the Sponsors decision may adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result. The Sponsor may also disagree with shareholders, security vendors and the Reference Rate Provider on what is generally accepted as ZEN and should therefore be considered ZEN for the Trusts purposes, which may also adversely affect the value of the Shares as a result.\nAny name change and any associated rebranding initiative by the core developers of ZEN may not be favorably received by the digital asset community, which could negatively impact the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nFrom time to time, digital assets may undergo name changes and associated rebranding initiatives. For example, Bitcoin Cash may sometimes be referred to as Bitcoin ABC in an effort to differentiate itself from any Bitcoin Cash hard forks, such as Bitcoin Satoshis Vision, and in the third quarter of 2018, the team behind Zen rebranded and changed the name of ZenCash to Horizen. We cannot predict the impact of any name change and any associated rebranding initiative on ZEN. After a name change and an associated rebranding initiative, a digital asset may not be able to achieve or maintain brand name recognition or status that is comparable to the recognition and status previously enjoyed by such digital asset. The failure of any name change and any associated rebranding initiative by a digital asset may result in such digital asset not realizing some or all of the anticipated benefits contemplated by the name change and associated rebranding initiative, and could negatively impact the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nThe cryptography used to enhance the privacy of transactions on the Horizen Network is new and could ultimately fail, or could be used to facilitate illicit activities, and businesses that facilitate transactions in ZEN may be at increased risk of criminal or civil lawsuits, or of having services cut off, which could negatively affect the price of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nThe Horizen Network uses zk-SNARKs, which add additional layers of confidentiality to transactions on the Horizen Network by protecting the amount and the recipient in ZEN transactions. This cryptography is new and could ultimately fail, resulting in less privacy than believed or no privacy at all, and could adversely affect ones ability to complete transactions on any such digital asset network or otherwise adversely interfere with the integrity of the relevant blockchain. For example, on February 5, 2019, the team behind Zcash, another zk-SNARKs-based protocol, announced that it discovered a vulnerability in zk-SNARKs that also existed on the Horizen Network and was subsequently patched on the Horizen Network in connection with a protocol upgrade in November 2018. The vulnerability was a counterfeiting vulnerability that could have allowed an attacker to exploit a flaw in the original zero-knowledge proof cryptography to act differently than intended and create fake ZEN on the Horizen Network without being detected. Although the privacy features prevent one from being certain no ZEN were counterfeited, the team behind Horizen found no evidence that counterfeiting occurred prior to the patch and believes the vulnerability has been fully remediated.\nMoreover, law enforcement agencies and other market participants have often relied on the transparency of blockchains to facilitate investigations and comply with laws, such as anti-money laundering and economic sanctions laws. Because of the privacy-enhancing features of the Horizen Network, law enforcement agencies and other market participants may have less visibility into transaction-level data, which may encourage bad actors to misuse the Horizen Network for such illicit purposes. As a result, businesses that facilitate transactions in ZEN may be at increased risk of potential criminal or civil lawsuits, or of having banking services cut off, if there is a concern that these features interfere with the performance of anti-money laundering duties and economic sanctions checks. In August 2019, for example, Coinbase UK delisted Zcash and in January 2021 Bittrex delisted Zcash as well as Monero and Dash, two other privacy-focused digital assets. Although neither exchange disclosed the reasons for such delisting and both exchanges subsequently relisted ZEC, it is believed that they were the result of the privacy-enhancing features of the digital assets, and there is a risk that digital asset exchanges may remove ZEN from their platforms as well. Other service providers of such businesses may also cut off services if there is a concern that the Horizen Network is being used to facilitate crime. Any of the aforementioned occurrences could adversely affect the price of ZEN, the attractiveness of the Horizen Network and an investment in the Shares of the Trust. It is unclear whether the removal of certain types of shielded transactions from Horizen in September 2023 would mitigate these concerns by regulators, law enforcement agencies, and other digital asset market participants regarding ZEN.\nWhen the Trust and the Sponsor, acting on behalf of the Trust, sell or deliver, as applicable, ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, they generally do not transact directly with counterparties other than the Authorized Participant or other similarly eligible financial institutions that are subject to federal and state licensing requirements and practices regarding AML and KYC regulations. When an Authorized Participant, or the Liquidity Provider on behalf of an Authorized Participant, sources ZEN in connection with the creation of the Shares or facilitates transactions in ZEN at the direction of the Trust or the Sponsor, it directly faces its counterparty and, in all instances, the Authorized Participant and its Liquidity Provider follow policies and procedures designed to ensure that it knows the identity of its counterparty. The Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider are registered broker-dealers and therefore subject to AML and countering the financing of terrorism obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act as administered by FinCEN and further overseen by the SEC and FINRA. In addition, the Liquidity Provider is a virtual currency entity licensed by the NYDFS, which additionally subjects it to AML obligations.\nIn accordance with its regulatory obligations, the Authorized Participant, or the Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant, conducts customer due diligence and enhanced due diligence on its counterparties, which enables it to determine each counterpartys AML and other risks and assign an appropriate risk rating.\nAs part of its counterparty onboarding process, each of the Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider uses third-party services to screen prospective counterparties against various watch lists, including the Specially Designated Nationals List of the Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and countries and territories identified as non-cooperative by the Financial Action Task Force. If the Sponsor, the Trust, the Authorized Participant or the Liquidity Provider were nevertheless to transact with such a sanctioned entity, the Sponsor, the Trust, the Authorized Participant and the Liquidity Provider would be at increased risk of potential criminal or civil lawsuits.\nRisk Factors Related to the Digital Asset Markets\nRecent developments in the digital asset economy have led to extreme volatility and disruption in digital asset markets, a loss of confidence in participants of the digital asset ecosystem, significant negative publicity surrounding digital assets broadly and market-wide declines in liquidity.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2021 to date in 2023, digital asset prices have fluctuated widely. This has led to volatility and disruption in the digital asset markets and financial difficulties for several prominent industry participants, including digital asset exchanges, hedge funds and lending platforms. For example, in the first half of 2022, digital asset lenders Celsius Network LLC and Voyager Digital Ltd. and digital asset hedge fund Three Arrows Capital each declared bankruptcy. This resulted in a loss of confidence in participants in the digital asset ecosystem, negative publicity surrounding digital assets more broadly and market-wide declines in digital asset trading prices and liquidity.\nThereafter, in November 2022, FTX, the third largest Digital Asset Exchange by volume at the time, halted customer withdrawals amid rumors of the companys liquidity issues and likely insolvency. Shortly thereafter, FTXs CEO resigned and FTX and several affiliates of FTX filed for bankruptcy. The U.S. Department of Justice subsequently brought criminal charges, including charges of fraud, violations of federal securities laws, money laundering, and campaign finance offenses, against FTXs former CEO and others. On November 2, 2023, FTXs former CEO was convicted of fraud and money laundering. FTX is also under investigation by the SEC, the Justice Department, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as by various regulatory authorities in the Bahamas, Europe and other jurisdictions. In response to these events, the digital asset markets have experienced extreme price volatility and declines in liquidity. In addition, several other entities in the digital asset industry filed for bankruptcy following FTXs bankruptcy filing, such as BlockFi Inc. and Genesis Global Capital, LLC (Genesis Capital), a subsidiary of Genesis Global Holdco, LLC (Genesis Holdco). The SEC also brought charges against Genesis Capital and Gemini Trust Company, LLC (Gemini) on January 12, 2023 for their alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities to retail investors. On October 19, 2023 the New York Attorney General brought\ncharges against Gemini, Genesis Capital, Genesis Asia Pacific PTE. LTD., Genesis Holdco, Genesis Capitals former CEO, DCG, and DCGs CEO alleging violations of the New York Penal Law, the New York General Business Law and the New York Executive Law.\nFurthermore, Genesis Holdco, together with certain of its subsidiaries, filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in January 2023. While Genesis Holdco is not a service provider to the Trust, it is a wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, and is an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor.\nThese events have led to a substantial increase in regulatory and enforcement scrutiny of the industry as a whole and of Digital Asset Exchanges in particular, including from the DOJ, the SEC, the CFTC, the White House and Congress. For example, in June 2023, the SEC brought charges against Binance and Coinbase, two of the largest digital asset trading platforms, alleging that they solicited U.S. investors to buy, sell, and trade crypto asset securities through their unregistered trading platforms and operated unregistered securities exchanges, brokerages and clearing agencies. Binance subsequently announced that it would be suspending USD deposits and withdrawals on Binance.US and that it plans to delist its USD trading pairs. The SECs actions against Binance and Coinbase led to further volatility in digital asset prices. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought similar charges against Kraken, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.\nThese events have also led to significant negative publicity around digital asset market participants including DCG, Genesis and DCGs other affiliated entities. This publicity could negatively impact the reputation of the Sponsor and have an adverse effect on the trading price and/or the value of the Shares. Moreover, sales of a significant number of Shares of the Trust as a result of these events could have a negative impact on the trading price of the Shares.\nFurther, in March 2023, the FDIC accepted Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank into receivership. Also, in March 2023, Silvergate Bank announced plans to wind down and liquidate its operations. Following these events, a number of companies that provide digital asset-related services have been unable to find banks that are willing to provide them with bank accounts and banking services. Although these events did not have a material impact on the Trust or the Sponsor, it is possible that a future closing of a bank with which the Trust or the Sponsor has a financial relationship could subject the Trust or the Sponsor to adverse conditions and pose challenges in finding an alternative suitable bank to provide the Trust or the Sponsor with bank accounts and banking services.\nThese events are continuing to develop at a rapid pace and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to the Sponsor, the Trust, their affiliates and/or the Trusts third-party service providers, or on the digital asset industry as a whole.\nContinued disruption and instability in the digital asset markets as these events develop, including further declines in the trading prices and liquidity of ZEN, could have a material adverse effect on the value of the Shares and the Shares could lose all or substantially all of their value.\nDue to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Digital Asset Exchanges, they may experience fraud, business failures, security failures or operational problems, which may adversely affect the value of ZEN and, consequently, the value of the Shares.\nDigital Asset Exchanges are relatively new and, in many ways, unregulated. While many prominent Digital Asset Exchanges provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management teams, corporate practices and regulatory compliance, many Digital Asset Exchanges do not provide this information. Furthermore, while Digital Asset Exchanges are and may continue to be subject to federal and state licensing requirements in the United States, Digital Asset Exchanges do not appear to be subject to regulation in a similar manner as other regulated trading platforms, such as national securities exchanges or designated contract markets. As a result, the marketplace may lose confidence in Digital Asset Exchanges, including prominent exchanges that handle a significant volume of ZEN trading.\nMany Digital Asset Exchanges are unlicensed, unregulated, operate without extensive supervision by governmental authorities, and do not provide the public with significant information regarding their ownership structure, management team, corporate practices, cybersecurity, and regulatory compliance. In particular, those located outside the United States may be subject to significantly less stringent regulatory and compliance requirements in their local jurisdictions. As a result, trading activity on or reported by these Digital Asset Exchanges is generally significantly less regulated than trading in regulated U.S. securities and commodities markets, and may reflect behavior that would be prohibited in regulated U.S. trading venues. For example, in 2022 one report claimed that trading volumes on unregulated Digital Asset Exchanges was inflated by over 70% due to false or non-economic trades, with specific focus on unlicensed exchanges located outside of the United States. Such reports may indicate that the Digital Asset Exchange Market is significantly smaller than expected and that the U.S. makes up a significantly larger percentage of the Digital Asset Exchange Market than is commonly understood. Nonetheless, any actual or perceived false trading in the Digital Asset Exchange Market, and any other fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices, could adversely affect the value of ZEN and/or negatively affect the market perception of ZEN.\nIn addition, over the past several years, some Digital Asset Exchanges have been closed, been subject to criminal and civil litigation and have entered into bankruptcy proceedings due to fraud and manipulative activity, business failure and/or security breaches. In many of these instances, the customers of such Digital Asset Exchanges were not compensated or made whole for the partial or\ncomplete losses of their account balances in such Digital Asset Exchanges. While smaller Digital Asset Exchanges are less likely to have the infrastructure and capitalization that make larger Digital Asset Exchanges more stable, larger Digital Asset Exchanges are more likely to be appealing targets for hackers and malware and their shortcomings or ultimate failures are more likely to have contagion effects on the digital asset ecosystem, and therefore may be more likely to be targets of regulatory enforcement action. For example, in February 2014, Mt. Gox, the largest Digital Asset Exchange at the time, halted withdrawals of Bitcoin and subsequently filed for bankruptcy protection in Japan following a hack that resulted in the loss of several hundred thousand Bitcoin. In the two weeks following the halt of Bitcoin withdrawals from Mt. Gox, the value of one Bitcoin fell on other exchanges from around $795 to $578. Failure and shortcomings of large Digital Asset Exchanges have since continued; in January 2015, Bitstamp announced that approximately 19,000 Bitcoin had been stolen from its operational or hot wallets, and in August 2016, it was reported that almost 120,000 Bitcoins worth around $78 million were stolen from Bitfinex. The value of Bitcoin and other digital assets immediately decreased over 10% following reports of the theft at Bitfinex. Regulatory enforcement actions have followed, such as in July 2017, when FinCEN assessed a $110 million fine against BTC-E, a now defunct Digital Asset Exchange, for facilitating crimes such as drug sales and ransomware attacks. In addition, in December 2017, Yapian, the operator of Seoul-based digital asset exchange Youbit, suspended digital asset trading and filed for bankruptcy following a hack that resulted in a loss of 17% of Yapians assets. In January 2018, the Japanese digital asset exchange, Coincheck, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $535 million, and in February 2018, the Italian digital asset exchange, Bitgrail, was hacked, resulting in approximately $170 million in losses. In May 2019, one of the worlds largest Digital Asset Exchanges, Binance, was hacked, resulting in losses of approximately $40 million. More recently, in November 2022, FTX, another of the worlds largest Digital Asset Exchanges, filed for bankruptcy protection and subsequently halted customer withdrawals as well as trading on its FTX.US platform. While details and events surrounding the failure continue to develop, and it is unclear what the eventual impacts of its bankruptcy will be, it appears that fraud, security failures and operational problems all played a role in FTXs issues. Moreover, Digital Asset Exchanges have been a subject of enhanced regulatory and enforcement scrutiny, and Digital Asset Markets have experienced continued instability, following the failure of FTX. In particular, in June 2023, the SEC brought enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, two of the largest digital asset trading platforms, alleging that Binance and Coinbase operated unregistered securities exchanges, brokerages and clearing agencies. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought similar charges against Kraken, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.\nNegative perception, a lack of stability and standardized regulation in the Digital Asset Markets and the closure or temporary shutdown of Digital Asset Exchanges due to fraud, business failure, security breaches or government mandated regulation, and associated losses by customers, may reduce confidence in the Horizen Network and result in greater volatility in the prices of ZEN. Furthermore, the closure or temporary shutdown of a Digital Asset Exchange used in calculating the Reference Rate Price may result in a loss of confidence in the Trusts ability to determine its Digital Asset Holdings on a daily basis. These potential consequences of such a Digital Asset Exchanges failure could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe value of the Shares relates directly to the value of ZEN, the value of which may be highly volatile and subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors.\nThe value of the Shares relates directly to the value of the ZEN held by the Trust and fluctuations in the price of ZEN could adversely affect the value of the Shares. The market price of ZEN may be highly volatile, and subject to a number of factors, including:\nAn increase in the global ZEN supply;\nManipulative trading activity on Digital Asset Exchanges, which, in many cases, are largely unregulated;\nThe adoption of ZEN as a medium of exchange, store-of-value or other consumptive asset and the maintenance and development of the open-source software protocol of the Horizen Network;\nForks in the Horizen Network;\nInvestors expectations with respect to interest rates, the rates of inflation of fiat currencies or ZEN, and digital asset exchange rates;\nConsumer preferences and perceptions of ZEN specifically and digital assets generally;\nFiat currency withdrawal and deposit policies on Digital Asset Exchanges;\nThe liquidity of Digital Asset Markets and any increase or decrease in trading volume on Digital Asset Markets;\nInvestment and trading activities of large investors that invest directly or indirectly in ZEN;\nA short squeeze resulting from speculation on the price of ZEN, if aggregate short exposure exceeds the number of Shares available for purchase;\nAn active derivatives market for ZEN or for digital assets generally;\nMonetary policies of governments, trade restrictions, currency devaluations and revaluations and regulatory measures or enforcement actions, if any, that restrict the use of ZEN as a form of payment or the purchase of ZEN on the Digital Asset Markets;\nGlobal or regional political, economic or financial conditions, events and situations, such as the novel coronavirus outbreak;\nFees associated with processing a ZEN transaction and the speed at which ZEN transactions are settled;\nInterruptions in service from or closures or failures of major Digital Asset Exchanges;\nDecreased confidence in Digital Asset Exchanges due to the unregulated nature and lack of transparency surrounding the operations of Digital Asset Exchanges;\nIncreased competition from other forms of digital assets or payment services; and\nThe Trusts own acquisitions or dispositions of ZEN, since there is no limit on the number of ZEN that the Trust may acquire.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that ZEN will maintain its value in the long or intermediate term. In the event that the price of ZEN declines, the Sponsor expects the value of the Shares to decline proportionately.\nThe value of a ZEN as represented by the Reference Rate Price or by the Trusts principal market may also be subject to momentum pricing due to speculation regarding future appreciation in value, leading to greater volatility that could adversely affect the value of the Shares. Momentum pricing typically is associated with growth stocks and other assets whose valuation, as determined by the investing public, accounts for future appreciation in value, if any. The Sponsor believes that momentum pricing of ZEN has resulted, and may continue to result, in speculation regarding future appreciation in the value of ZEN, inflating and making the Reference Rate Price more volatile. As a result, ZEN may be more likely to fluctuate in value due to changing investor confidence, which could impact future appreciation or depreciation in the Reference Rate Price and could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Reference Rate has a limited history and a failure of the Reference Rate Price could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Reference Rate has a limited history and the Reference Rate Price is an average composite reference rate calculated using volume-weighted trading price data from various Digital Asset Exchanges chosen by the Reference Rate Provider. The Digital Asset Exchanges chosen by the Reference Rate Provider have also changed over time. For example, on January 4, 2023, CoinDesk Indices, Inc., the Reference Rate Provider, removed Bittrex from the Reference Rate due to the exchange not meeting the Reference Rate Providers minimum liquidity requirement, and did not add any Constituent Exchanges as part of its scheduled quarterly review. Thereafter, on April 4, 2023, the Reference Rate Provider added Bittrex back to the Reference Rate due to the exchange now meeting the Reference Rate Providers minimum liquidity requirement. Subsequently, on April 21, 2023, the Reference Rate Provider removed Bittrex from the Reference Rate due to Bittrexs announcement that the exchange would no longer service U.S. customers. In addition, effective June 16, 2023, the Reference Rate Provider removed Binance.US from the Reference Rate due to Binance.USs announcement that the exchange was suspending USD deposits and withdrawals and planned to delist its USD trading pairs. As a result of this removal, there were no longer sufficient Constituent Exchanges for the Reference Rate Provider to continue producing the Reference Rate pursuant to the Constituent Exchange selection methodology described in Item 1. Business- Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Constituent Exchange Selection.\nIf the Reference Rate becomes unavailable, the Sponsor employs an alternative method to determine the Reference Rate Price under the cascading set of rules set forth in Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Determination of the Reference Rate Price When Reference Rate Price is Unavailable. Effective June 20, 2023, CoinDesk Indices, Inc. no longer determines the Reference Rate Price, and the Reference Rate Price is the Secondary Reference Rate Price, which is the price set by Coin Metrics Real-Time Rate as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. The Secondary Reference Rate Price is a real-time reference rate price, calculated using trade data from constituent markets selected by Coin Metrics, Inc., the Secondary Reference Rate Provider. Effective June 20, 2023, any references to the Reference Rate Price in this Annual Report refers to the Secondary Reference Rate Price set by the Secondary Reference Rate selected by the Secondary Reference Rate Provider.\nThe Reference Rate Provider may remove or add Digital Asset Exchanges to the Reference Rate in the future at its discretion. For more information on the inclusion criteria for Digital Asset Exchanges in the Reference Rate, see Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price.\nAlthough the Reference Rate is designed to accurately capture the market price of ZEN, third parties may be able to purchase and sell ZEN on public or private markets not included among the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges of the Reference Rate, and such transactions may take place at prices materially higher or lower than the Reference Rate Price. Moreover, there may be variances in the prices of ZEN on the various Digital Asset Exchanges, including as a result of differences in fee structures or administrative procedures on different Digital Asset Exchanges. For example, based on data provided by the Reference Rate Provider, on any given day during the year ended September 30, 2023, the maximum differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of any single Digital Asset Exchange included in the Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price was 32.96% and the average of the maximum differentials of the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot price of each Digital Asset Exchange included in the Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price was 21.60%. During this same period, the average differential between the 4:00 p.m., New York time spot prices of all the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price was 0.12%. All Digital Asset Exchanges that were included in the Reference Rate throughout the period were considered in this analysis. To the extent such prices differ materially from the Reference Rate Price, investors may lose confidence in the Shares ability to track the market price of ZEN, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe Reference Rate Price used to calculate the value of the Trusts ZEN may be volatile, and purchasing activity in the Digital Asset Markets associated with Basket creations may affect the Reference Rate Price and Share trading prices, adversely affecting the value of the Shares.\nThe price of ZEN on public Digital Asset Exchanges has a very limited history, and during this history, ZEN prices on the Digital Asset Markets more generally, and on Digital Asset Exchanges individually, have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors, including operational interruptions. While the Reference Rate is designed to limit exposure to the interruption of individual Digital Asset Exchanges, the Reference Rate Price, and the price of ZEN generally, remains subject to volatility experienced by Digital Asset Exchanges, and such volatility could adversely affect the value of the Shares. For example, from October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2023, the Reference Rate Price ranged from $3.28 to $152.74, with the straight average being $24.29 through September 30, 2023. In addition, for the year ended September 30, 2023, the Reference Rate Price ranged from $5.92 to $14.73. The Sponsor has not observed a material difference between the Reference Rate Price and average prices from the constituent Digital Asset Exchanges individually or as a group. The price of ZEN more generally has experienced volatility similar to the Reference Rate Price during these periods. For additional information on movement of the Reference Rate Price and the price of ZEN, see Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Historical Digital Asset Holdings and ZEN Prices.\nFurthermore, because the number of Digital Asset Exchanges is limited, the Reference Rate will necessarily be composed of a limited number of Digital Asset Exchanges. If a Digital Asset Exchange were subjected to regulatory, volatility or other pricing issues, the Reference Rate Provider would have limited ability to remove such Digital Asset Exchange from the Reference Rate, which could skew the price of ZEN as represented by the Reference Rate. Trading on a limited number of Digital Asset Exchanges may result in less favorable prices and decreased liquidity of ZEN and, therefore, could have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.\nPurchasing activity associated with acquiring ZEN required for the creation of Baskets may increase the market price of ZEN on the Digital Asset Markets, which will result in higher prices for the Shares. Increases in the market price of ZEN may also occur as a result of the purchasing activity of other market participants. Other market participants may attempt to benefit from an increase in the market price of ZEN that may result from increased purchasing activity of ZEN connected with the issuance of Baskets. Consequently, the market price of ZEN may decline immediately after Baskets are created. Decreases in the market price of ZEN may also occur as a result of sales in Secondary Markets by other market participants. If the Reference Rate Price declines, the value of the Shares will generally also decline.\nCompetition from the emergence or growth of other digital assets or methods of investing in ZEN could have a negative impact on the price of ZEN and adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nAs of September 30, 2023, ZEN was the 182nd largest digital asset by market capitalization as tracked by CoinMarketCap.com. As of September 30, 2023, the alternative digital assets tracked by CoinMarketCap.com had a total market capitalization of approximately $958.3 billion (including the approximately $110.4 million market cap of ZEN), as calculated using market prices and total available supply of each digital asset, excluding tokens pegged to other assets. In addition, many consortiums and financial institutions are also researching and investing resources into private or permissioned blockchain platforms rather than open platforms like the Horizen Network. ZEN faces competition from a wide range of digital assets. In addition, ZEN is currently supported by fewer exchanges than more established digital assets, such as Bitcoin and Ether, which could impact its liquidity. Competition from the emergence or growth of alternative digital assets could have a negative impact on the demand for, and price of, ZEN and thereby adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nIn addition, some digital asset networks may be the target of ill will from users of other digital asset networks. For example, Horizen is the result of a fork of Zclassic, which in turn is a clone of Zcash which itself was a clone of Bitcoin. and some users of those digital asset networks may harbor ill will toward the Horizon Network, and vice versa. These users may attempt to negatively impact the use or adoption of the Horizen Network.\nInvestors may invest in ZEN through means other than the Shares, including through direct investments in ZEN and other potential financial vehicles, possibly including securities backed by or linked to ZEN and digital asset financial vehicles similar to the Trust. Market and financial conditions, and other conditions beyond the Sponsors control, may make it more attractive to invest in other financial vehicles or to invest in ZEN directly, which could limit the market for, and reduce the liquidity of, the Shares. In addition, to the extent digital asset financial vehicles other than the Trust tracking the price of ZEN are formed and represent a significant proportion of the demand for ZEN, large purchases or redemptions of the securities of these digital asset financial vehicles, or private funds holding ZEN, could negatively affect the Reference Rate Price, the Digital Asset Holdings, the value of the Shares, the NAV and the NAV per Share. Moreover, any reduced demand for Shares of the Trust may cause the Shares of the Trust to trade at a discount to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nPrices of ZEN may be affected due to stablecoins (including Tether and U.S. Dollar Coin (USDC)), the activities of stablecoin issuers and their regulatory treatment.\nWhile the Trust does not invest in stablecoins, it may nonetheless be exposed to these and other risks that stablecoins pose for the market for ZEN and other digital assets. Stablecoins are digital assets designed to have a stable value over time as compared to typically volatile digital assets, and are typically marketed as being pegged to a fiat currency, such as the U.S. dollar, at a certain value. Although the prices of stablecoins are intended to be stable, in many cases their prices fluctuate, sometimes significantly. This volatility has in the past impacted the prices of certain digital assets, and has at times caused certain stablecoins to lose their peg to the underlying fiat currency. Stablecoins are a relatively new phenomenon, and it is impossible to know all of the risks that they could pose to participants in the digital asset markets. In addition, some have argued that some stablecoins, particularly Tether, are improperly issued without sufficient backing in a way that could cause artificial rather than genuine demand for digital assets, raising their prices. On February 17, 2021 the New York Attorney General entered into an agreement with Tethers operators, requiring them to cease any further trading activity with New York persons and pay $18.5 million in penalties for false and misleading statements made regarding the assets backing Tether. On October 15, 2021, the CFTC announced a settlement with Tethers operators in which they agreed to pay $42.5 million in fines to settle charges that, among others, Tethers claims that it maintained sufficient U.S. dollar reserves to back every Tether stablecoin in circulation with the equivalent amount of corresponding fiat currency held by Tether were untrue.\nUSDC is a reserve-backed stablecoin issued by Circle Internet Financial that is commonly used as a method of payment in digital asset markets, including the ZEN market. The issuer of USDC uses the Circle Reserve Fund to hold cash, U.S. Treasury bills, notes and other obligations issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S. Treasury, and repurchase agreements secured by such obligations or cash, which serve as reserves backing USDC stablecoins. While USDC is designed to maintain a stable value at 1 U.S. dollar at all times, on March 10, 2023, the value of USDC fell below $1.00 (and remained below for multiple days) after Circle Internet Financial disclosed that $3.3 billion of the USDC reserves were held at Silicon Valley Bank, which had entered FDIC receivership earlier that day. Popular stablecoins are reliant on the U.S. banking system and U.S. treasuries, and the failure of either to function normally could impede the function of stablecoins or lead to outsized redemption requests, and therefore could adversely affect the broader value of the Shares.\nSome stablecoins have been asserted to be securities under the federal securities laws. For example, on June 5, 2023, the SEC alleged in a complaint that the stablecoin BUSD was a crypto asset security and that Binance offered and sold to U.S. investors as part of a profit-earning scheme within the Binance ecosystem. In another example, the District Court for the Southern District of New York denied defendants motion to dismiss an SEC complaint asserting that the stablecoin UST is a security. Further public concern about the possible security status of stablecoins manifested in November 2023, when the financial technology company PayPal disclosed in a filing that it had received a subpoena from the SEC relating to the PayPal USD stablecoin that requested the production of documents. A determination that a popular stablecoin is a security could lead to outsized redemption requests, and therefore could adversely affect the broader value of the Shares.\nGiven the role that stablecoins play in global digital asset markets, their fundamental liquidity can have a dramatic impact on the broader digital asset market, including the market for ZEN. Because a large portion of the digital asset market still depends on stablecoins such as Tether and USDC, there is a risk that a disorderly de-pegging or a run on Tether or USDC could lead to dramatic market volatility in, and/or materially and adversely affect the prices of, digital assets more broadly.\nVolatility in stablecoins, operational issues with stablecoins (for example, technical issues that prevent settlement), concerns about the sufficiency of any reserves that support stablecoins, or regulatory concerns about stablecoin issuers or intermediaries, such as bitcoin\nspot markets, that support stablecoins, could impact individuals' willingness to trade on trading venues that rely on stablecoins and could impact the price of ZEN, and in turn, an investment in the Shares.\nFailure of funds that hold digital assets or that have exposure to digital assets through derivatives to receive SEC approval to list their shares on exchanges could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThere have been a growing a number of attempts to list on national securities exchanges the shares of funds that hold digital assets or that have exposures to digital assets through derivatives. These investment vehicles attempt to provide institutional and retail investors exposure to markets for digital assets and related products. The SEC has repeatedly denied such requests. In January 2018, the SECs Division of Investment Management outlined several questions that sponsors would be expected to address before the SEC will consider granting approval for funds holding substantial amounts of cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrency-related products. The questions, which focus on specific requirements of the Investment Company Act, generally fall into one of five key areas: valuation, liquidity, custody, arbitrage and potential manipulation. The SEC has not explicitly stated whether each of the questions set forth would also need to be addressed by entities with similar products and investment strategies that instead pursue registered offerings under the Securities Act, although such entities would need to comply with the registration and prospectus disclosure requirements of the Securities Act. Furthermore, NYSE Arca previously withdrew the Sponsors application with the SEC to list an affiliate of the Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), on a national securities exchange. Requests to list the shares of other funds on national securities exchanges have also been submitted to the SEC. Although the SEC has approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, it has not approved any requests to list the shares of digital asset funds like the Trust to date. The requests to list the shares of digital asset funds submitted by the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) and the NYSE Arca in 2019 were withdrawn or received disapprovals. Subsequently, NYSE Arca and CBOE filed several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds in 2021. Several of those requests were denied by the SEC in 2021 and 2022, including a second request by NYSE Arca to list the shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), which was denied in June 2022. In June 2023, NYSE Arca, CBOE and The Nasdaq Stock Market again submitted several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds. These requests remain pending with the SEC. The Sponsor petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the SECs final order denying approval to list shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product. On August 29, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Sponsors petition and vacated the SECs order as arbitrary and capricious. The SEC did not seek panel rehearing or rehearing en banc. On October 23, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the SEC. There is no guarantee that the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will ultimately result in approval of NYSE Arcas 19b-4 application to list the shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on NYSE Arca as an exchange traded product. Moreover, even if NYSE Arcas request with respect to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) is approved, there is no guarantee that a similar application to list Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca, or another national securities exchange, would also be approved. In particular, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that the SEC has publicly indicated it does not currently view as a security and the SEC is unlikely to approve a request to list the shares of a spot exchange-traded product that holds a digital asset that the SEC believes is a security. Moreover, even if the SEC took the view that a digital asset was not a security, based on prior spot exchange-traded product disapprovals, the existence of a CFTC-regulated futures market for the relevant digital asset would be central to the SECs approval of any request to list the shares of a spot exchange-traded product holding such digital asset. As of the date hereof, there are only CFTC-regulated futures markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum. As such, significant barriers to regulatory approval for any request to list the shares of other digital asset investment vehicles, including the Shares of the Trust, remain, and investors should not assume that approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product in the future would subsequently lead to approval of spot exchange-traded products holding other digital assets, such as the Trust. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be successful in listing the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca even once the Sponsor decides to do so.\nThe exchange listing of shares of digital asset funds would create more opportunities for institutional and retail investors to invest in the digital asset market. If exchange-listing requests are not approved by the SEC and further requests are ultimately denied by the SEC, increased investment interest by institutional or retail investors could fail to materialize, which could reduce the demand for digital assets generally and therefore adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nRisk Factors Related to the Trust and the Shares\nThe Trust relies on third-party service providers to perform certain functions essential to the affairs of the Trust and the replacement of such service providers could pose a challenge to the safekeeping of the Trusts ZEN and to the operations of the Trust.\nThe Trust relies on the Custodian, the Authorized Participant and other third-party service providers to perform certain functions essential to managing the affairs of the Trust. In addition, the Authorized Participant relies on Liquidity Providers to source ZEN in connection with the creation of Shares. Any disruptions to such service providers business operations, resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems could have an adverse impact on the Trusts ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Trust and require the Sponsor to replace such service provider. Moreover, the Sponsor could decide to replace a service provider to the Trust, or the Authorized Participant may decide to replace a Liquidity Provider for other reasons.\nIf the Sponsor decides, or is required, to replace Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC as the custodian of the Trusts ZEN, transferring maintenance responsibilities of the Digital Asset Account to another party will likely be complex and could subject the Trusts ZEN to the risk of loss during the transfer, which could have a negative impact on the performance of the Shares or result in loss of the Trusts assets.\nMoreover, the legal rights of customers with respect to digital assets held on their behalf by a third-party custodian, such as the Custodian, in insolvency proceedings are currently uncertain. The Custodian Agreement contains an agreement by the parties to treat the digital assets credited to the Trusts Digital Asset Account as financial assets under Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial Code (Article 8), in addition to stating that the Custodian will serve as fiduciary and custodian on the Trusts behalf. The Custodians parent, Coinbase Global, Inc., has stated in its public securities filings that in light of the inclusion in its custody agreements of provisions relating to Article 8 it believes that a court would not treat custodied digital assets as part of its general estate in the event the Custodian were to experience insolvency. However, due to the novelty of digital asset custodial arrangements courts have not yet considered this type of treatment for custodied digital assets and it is not possible to predict with certainty how they would rule in such a scenario. If the Custodian became subject to insolvency proceedings and a court were to rule that the custodied digital assets were part of the Custodians general estate and not the property of the Trust, then the Trust would be treated as a general unsecured creditor in the Custodians insolvency proceedings and the Trust could be subject to the loss of all or a significant portion of its assets.\nTo the extent that Sponsor is not able to find a suitable party willing to serve as the custodian, the Sponsor may be required to terminate the Trust and liquidate the Trusts ZEN. In addition, to the extent that the Sponsor finds a suitable party and must enter into a modified Custodian Agreement that is less favorable for the Trust or Sponsor and/or transfer the Trusts assets in a relatively short time period, the safekeeping of the Trusts ZEN may be adversely affected, which may in turn adversely affect value of the Shares. Likewise, if the Sponsor and/or the Authorized Participant is required to replace any other service provider, they may not be able to find a party willing to serve in such capacity in a timely manner or at all. If the Sponsor decides, or is required, to replace the Authorized Participant and/or if the Authorized Participant decides, or is required, to replace a Liquidity Provider, this could negatively impact the Trusts ability to create new Shares, which would impact the Shares liquidity and could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares.\nBecause of the holding period under Rule 144, the lack of an ongoing redemption program and the Trusts ability to halt creations from time to time, there is no arbitrage mechanism to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Reference Rate Price and the Shares have historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nShares purchased in the private placement are subject to a holding period under Rule 144. Pursuant to Rule 144, the minimum holding period for Shares purchased in the private placement is six months. In addition, the Trust does not currently operate an ongoing redemption program and may halt creations from time to time. As a result, the Trust cannot rely on arbitrage opportunities resulting from differences between the value of the Shares and the price of ZEN to keep the value of the Shares closely linked to the Reference Rate Price. As a result, the value of the Shares of the Trust may not approximate the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share or meet the Trusts investment objective, and may trade at a substantial premium over, or substantial discount to, the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share. For example, in the past, the price of the Shares as quoted on OTCQX varied significantly from the Digital Asset Holdings per Share due to these factors, among others, and has historically traded at a substantial premium over, and a substantial discount to, the Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nThe Shares may trade at a price that is at, above or below the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share as a result of the non-current trading hours between OTCQX and the Digital Asset Exchange Market.\nThe Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share will fluctuate with changes in the market value of ZEN, and the Sponsor expects the trading price of the Shares to fluctuate in accordance with changes in the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share, as well as market supply and demand. However, the Shares may trade on OTCQX at, above or below the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share for a variety of reasons. For example, OTCQX is open for trading in the Shares for a limited period each day, but the Digital Asset Exchange Market is a 24-hour marketplace. During periods when OTCQX is closed but Digital Asset Exchanges are open, significant changes in the price of ZEN on the Digital Asset Exchange Market could result in a difference in performance between the value of ZEN as measured by the Reference Rate and the most recent Digital Asset Holdings per Share or closing trading price. For example, if the price of ZEN on the Digital Asset Exchange Market, and the value of ZEN as measured by the Reference Rate, moves significantly in a negative direction after the close of OTCQX, the trading price of the Shares may gap down to the full extent of such negative price shift when OTCQX reopens. If the price of ZEN on the Digital Asset Exchange Market drops significantly during hours OTCQX is closed, shareholders may not be able to sell their Shares until after the gap down has been fully realized, resulting in an inability to mitigate losses in a rapidly negative market. Even during periods when OTCQX is open, large Digital Asset Exchanges (or a substantial number of smaller Digital Asset Exchanges) may be lightly traded or closed for any number of reasons, which could increase trading spreads and widen any premium or discount on the Shares.\nShareholders may suffer a loss on their investment if the Shares trade above or below the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nHistorically, the Shares have traded at both premiums and discounts to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share, which at times have been substantial. If the Shares trade at a premium, investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX will pay more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares directly from Authorized Participants. In contrast, if the Shares trade on OTCQX at a discount, investors who purchase Shares directly from Authorized Participants will pay more for their Shares than investors who purchase Shares on OTCQX. The premium or discount at which the Shares have traded has fluctuated over time. From October 19, 2021 to September 30, 2023, the maximum premium of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX over the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 127% and the average premium was 20%. Moreover, the closing price of the Shares, as quoted on OTCQX at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day between October 19, 2021 and September 30, 2023, has been quoted at a discount on 342 days. From October 19, 2021 to September 30, 2023, the maximum discount of the closing price of the Shares quoted on OTCQX below the value of the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share was 54%, and the average discount was 20%. As of September 29, 2023, the last business day of the period, the Trusts Shares were quoted on OTCQX at a premium of 11% to the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share. As a result, shareholders who purchase Shares on OTCQX may suffer a loss on their investment if they sell their Shares at a time when the premium has decreased from the premium at which they purchased the Shares even if the Digital Asset Holdings per Share remains the same. Likewise, shareholders that purchase Shares directly from the Trust may suffer a loss on their investment if they sell their Shares at a time when the Shares are trading at a discount on OTCQX. Furthermore, shareholders may suffer a loss on their investment even if the Digital Asset Holdings per Share increases because the decrease in any premium or increase in any discount may offset any increase in the Digital Asset Holdings per Share.\nThe amount of the Trusts assets represented by each Share will decline over time as the Trust pays the Sponsors Fee and Additional Trust Expenses, and as a result, the value of the Shares may decrease over time.\nThe Sponsors Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars at an annual rate based on the Digital Asset Holdings Fee Basis Amount, which is based on the Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust, and is paid to the Sponsor in ZEN. See Item 1. Business-Valuation of ZEN and Determination of Digital Asset Holdings-Disposition of ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency and Item 1. Business-Activities of the Trust-Hypothetical Expense Example. As a result, the amount of Trusts assets represented by each Share declines as the Trust pays the Sponsors Fee (or sells ZEN in order to raise cash to pay any Additional Trust Expenses), which may cause the Shares to decrease in value over time or dampen any increase in value.\nThe value of the Shares may be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to the value of ZEN.\nThe value of the Shares may be influenced by a variety of factors unrelated to the price of ZEN and the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate that may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares. These factors include the following factors:\nUnanticipated problems or issues with respect to the mechanics of the Trusts operations and the trading of the Shares may arise, in particular due to the fact that the mechanisms and procedures governing the creation and offering of the Shares and storage of ZEN have been developed specifically for this product;\nThe Trust could experience difficulties in operating and maintaining its technical infrastructure, including in connection with expansions or updates to such infrastructure, which are likely to be complex and could lead to unanticipated delays, unforeseen expenses and security vulnerabilities;\nThe Trust could experience unforeseen issues relating to the performance and effectiveness of the security procedures used to protect the Digital Asset Account, or the security procedures may not protect against all errors, software flaws or other vulnerabilities in the Trusts technical infrastructure, which could result in theft, loss or damage of its assets; or\nAlthough the Horizen Network has removed some privacy enhancing features, service providers may decide to terminate their relationships with the Trust due to concerns that ZENs remaining privacy features, or the introduction of additional privacy enhancing features to the Horizen Network, may increase the potential for ZEN to be used to facilitate crime, exposing such service providers to potential reputational harm.\nAny of these factors could affect the value of the Shares, either directly or indirectly through their effect on the Trusts assets.\nShareholders do not have the protections associated with ownership of shares in an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act or the protections afforded by the CEA.\nThe Investment Company Act is designed to protect investors by preventing insiders from managing investment companies to their benefit and to the detriment of public investors, such as: the issuance of securities having inequitable or discriminatory provisions; the management of investment companies by irresponsible persons; the use of unsound or misleading methods of computing earnings and asset value; changes in the character of investment companies without the consent of investors; and investment companies from engaging in excessive leveraging. To accomplish these ends, the Investment Company Act requires the safekeeping and proper valuation\nof fund assets, restricts greatly transactions with affiliates, limits leveraging, and imposes governance requirements as a check on fund management.\nThe Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act, and the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not required to register under such act. Consequently, shareholders do not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in investment companies.\nThe Trust will not hold or trade in commodity interests regulated by the CEA, as administered by the CFTC. Furthermore, the Sponsor believes that the Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA, and that neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation by the CFTC as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with the operation of the Trust. Consequently, shareholders will not have the regulatory protections provided to investors in CEA-regulated instruments or commodity pools.\nThe restrictions on transfer and redemption may result in losses on the value of the Shares.\nShares purchased in the private placement may not be resold except in transactions exempt from registration under the Securities Act and state securities laws, and any such transaction must be approved in advance by the Sponsor. In determining whether to grant approval, the Sponsor will specifically look at whether the conditions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act and any other applicable laws have been met. Any attempt to sell Shares without the approval of the Sponsor in its sole discretion will be void ab initio. See Item 1. Business-Description of the Shares-Transfer Restrictions for more information.\nAt this time the Sponsor is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Therefore, unless the Trust is permitted to, and does, establish a Share redemption program, shareholders will be unable to (or could be significantly impeded in attempting to) sell or otherwise liquidate investments in the Shares, which could have a material adverse impact on demand for the Shares and their value.\nAffiliates of the Trust previously entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC concerning the operation of one such affiliates former redemption programs.\nOn April 1, 2014, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), an affiliate of the Trust, launched a program pursuant to which its shareholders could request redemptions from Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the sole Authorized Participant of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) at that time. On September 23, 2014, Genesis received a letter from the staff of the SECs Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations summarizing the staffs findings from an onsite review of Genesiss broker-dealer activities conducted in June 2014. In its exit report, the staff stated that it had concluded that Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC)s redemption program, in which its shareholders were permitted to request the redemption of their shares through Genesis, appeared to violate Regulation M under the Exchange Act because such redemptions of shares took place at the same time Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) was in the process of creating shares. On July 11, 2016, Genesis and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) entered into a settlement agreement with the SEC whereby they agreed to a cease-and-desist order against future violations of Rules 101 and 102 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Genesis also agreed to pay disgorgement of $51,650.11 in redemption fees it collected, plus prejudgment interest of $2,105.68, for a total of $53,755.79. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking an exemption from the SEC under Regulation M in order to instate a redemption program.\nThere is no guarantee that an active trading market for the Shares will continue to develop.\nThe Shares are qualified for public trading on OTCQX and an active trading market for the Shares has developed. However, there can be no assurance that such trading market will be maintained or continue to develop. In addition, OTCQX can halt the trading of the Shares for a variety of reasons. To the extent that OTCQX halts trading in the Shares, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, investors may not be able to buy or sell Shares, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares. If an active trading market for the Shares does not continue to exist, the market prices and liquidity of the Shares may be adversely affected.\nThe Sponsor also intends to seek to list the Shares on NYSE Arca sometime in the future. NYSE Arca must receive approval from the SEC in order to list the Shares. Although the SEC has approved several futures-based Bitcoin ETFs, it has not approved any requests to list the shares of digital asset funds like the Trust to date. The requests to list the shares of digital asset funds submitted by CBOE and the NYSE Arca in 2019 were withdrawn or received disapprovals. Subsequently, NYSE Arca and CBOE filed several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds in 2021. Several of those requests were denied by the SEC in 2021 and 2022, including a second request by NYSE Arca to list the shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), which was denied in June 2022. In June 2023, NYSE Arca, CBOE and The Nasdaq Stock Market again submitted several new requests to list shares of various digital asset funds. These requests remain pending with the SEC. The Sponsor petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the SECs final order denying approval to list shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on NYSE Arca as an exchange-traded product. On August 29, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Sponsors petition and vacated the SECs order as arbitrary and capricious. The SEC did not seek panel rehearing or rehearing en banc. On October 23, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the SEC. There is no guarantee that the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will ultimately result in approval of NYSE Arcas 19b-4 application to list the shares of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) on NYSE Arca as an exchange traded product.\nMoreover, even if NYSE Arcas request with respect to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) is approved, there is no guarantee that a similar application to list Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca, or another national securities exchange, would also be approved. In particular, Bitcoin is the only digital asset that the SEC has publicly indicated it does not currently view as a security and the SEC is unlikely to approve a request to list the shares of a spot exchange-traded product that holds a digital asset that the SEC believes is a security. Moreover, even if the SEC took the view that a digital asset was not a security, based on prior spot exchange-traded product disapprovals, the existence of a CFTC-regulated futures market for the relevant digital asset would be central to the SECs approval of any request to list the shares of a spot exchange-traded product holding such digital asset. As of the date hereof, there are only CFTC-regulated futures markets for Bitcoin and Ethereum. As such, significant barriers to regulatory approval for any request to list the shares of other digital asset investment vehicles, including the Shares of the Trust, remain, and investors should not assume that approval of a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded product in the future would subsequently lead to approval of spot exchange-traded products holding other digital assets, such as the Trust. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be successful in listing the Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca even once the Sponsor decides to do so.\nAs the Sponsor and its management have limited history of operating investment vehicles like the Trust, their experience may be inadequate or unsuitable to manage the Trust.\nThe past performances of the Sponsors management in other investment vehicles, including their experiences in the digital asset and venture capital industries, are no indication of their ability to manage an investment vehicle such as the Trust. If the experience of the Sponsor and its management is inadequate or unsuitable to manage an investment vehicle such as the Trust, the operations of the Trust may be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, the Sponsor is currently engaged in the management of other investment vehicles which could divert their attention and resources. If the Sponsor were to experience difficulties in the management of such other investment vehicles that damaged the Sponsor or its reputation, it could have an adverse impact on the Sponsors ability to continue to serve as Sponsor for the Trust.\nSecurity threats to the Digital Asset Account could result in the halting of Trust operations and a loss of Trust assets or damage to the reputation of the Trust, each of which could result in a reduction in the value of the Shares.\nSecurity breaches, computer malware and computer hacking attacks have been a prevalent concern in relation to digital assets. The Sponsor believes that the Trusts ZEN held in the Digital Asset Account will be an appealing target to hackers or malware distributors seeking to destroy, damage or steal the Trusts ZEN and will only become more appealing as the Trusts assets grow. To the extent that the Trust, the Sponsor or the Custodian is unable to identify and mitigate or stop new security threats or otherwise adapt to technological changes in the digital asset industry, the Trusts ZEN may be subject to theft, loss, destruction or other attack.\nThe Sponsor believes that the security procedures in place for the Trust, including, but not limited to, offline storage, or cold storage, multiple encrypted private key shards, usernames, passwords and 2-step verification, are reasonably designed to safeguard the Trusts ZEN. Nevertheless, the security procedures cannot guarantee the prevention of any loss due to a security breach, software defect or act of God that may be borne by the Trust.\nThe security procedures and operational infrastructure may be breached due to the actions of outside parties, error or malfeasance of an employee of the Sponsor, the Custodian, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to a Digital Asset Account, the relevant private keys (and therefore ZEN) or other data of the Trust. Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees of the Sponsor or the Custodian to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to the Trusts infrastructure. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, or may be designed to remain dormant until a predetermined event and often are not recognized until launched against a target, the Sponsor and the Custodian may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.\nAn actual or perceived breach of a Digital Asset Account could harm the Trusts operations, result in loss of the Trusts assets, damage the Trusts reputation and negatively affect the market perception of the effectiveness of the Trust, all of which could in turn reduce demand for the Shares, resulting in a reduction in the value of the Shares. The Trust may also cease operations, the occurrence of which could similarly result in a reduction in the value of the Shares.\nZEN transactions are irrevocable and stolen or incorrectly transferred ZEN may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed ZEN transactions could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nZEN transactions are typically not reversible without the consent and active participation of the recipient of the transaction. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the Blockchain, an incorrect transfer or theft of ZEN generally will not be reversible and the Trust may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. Although the Trusts transfers of ZEN will regularly be made to or from the Digital Asset Account, it is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the Trusts ZEN could be transferred from the Trusts Digital Asset Account in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts.\nSuch events have occurred in connection with digital assets in the past. For example, in September 2014, the Chinese Digital Asset Exchange Huobi announced that it had sent approximately 900 Bitcoins and 8,000 Litecoins (worth approximately $400,000 at the prevailing market prices at the time) to the wrong customers. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek a corrective transaction with such third party or is incapable of identifying the third party which has received the Trusts ZEN through error or theft, the Trust will be unable to revert or otherwise recover incorrectly transferred ZEN. The Trust will also be unable to convert or recover its ZEN transferred to uncontrolled accounts. To the extent that the Trust is unable to seek redress for such error or theft, such loss could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe lack of full insurance and shareholders limited rights of legal recourse against the Trust, Trustee, Sponsor, Transfer Agent and Custodian expose the Trust and its shareholders to the risk of loss of the Trusts ZEN for which no person or entity is liable.\nThe Trust is not a banking institution or otherwise a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) and, therefore, deposits held with or assets held by the Trust are not subject to the protections enjoyed by depositors with FDIC or SIPC member institutions. In addition, neither the Trust nor the Sponsor insure the Trusts ZEN. While the Custodian has advised the Sponsor that it has insurance coverage of up to $320 million that covers losses of the digital assets it custodies on behalf of its clients, including the Trusts ZEN, resulting from theft, shareholders cannot be assured that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to the Trusts ZEN. While the Custodian maintains certain capital reserve requirements depending on the assets under custody, and such capital reserves may provide additional means to cover client asset losses, the Sponsor does not know the amount of such capital reserves, and neither the Trust nor the Sponsor have access to such information. The Trust cannot be assured that the Custodian will maintain capital reserves sufficient to cover losses with respect to the Trusts digital assets.\nFurthermore, under the Custodian Agreement, the Custodians liability with respect to the Trust will never exceed the value of the ZEN on deposit in the Digital Asset Account at the time of, and directly relating to, the events giving rise to the liability occurred, as determined in accordance with the Custodian Agreement. In addition, for as long as a cold storage address holds ZEN with a value in excess of the Cold Storage Threshold for a period of five consecutive business days or more without being reduced to the Cold Storage Threshold or lower, the Custodians maximum liability for such cold storage address shall be limited to the Cold Storage Threshold. The Sponsor monitors the value of ZEN deposited in cold storage addresses for whether the Cold Storage Threshold has been met by determining the U.S. dollar value of ZEN deposited in each cold storage address on business days. The Custodian is not liable for any lost profits or any special, incidental, indirect, intangible, or consequential damages, whether based in contract, tort, negligence, strict liability or otherwise, and whether or not the Custodian has been advised of such losses or the Custodian knew or should have known of the possibility of such damages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Custodian is liable to the Sponsor and the Trust for the loss of any ZEN to the extent that the Custodian directly caused such loss through a breach of the Custodian Agreement, even if the Custodian meets its duty of exercising best efforts, and the Custodian is required to return to the Trust a quantity equal to the quantity of any such lost ZEN. Although the Cold Storage Threshold has never been met for a given cold storage address, to the extent it is met and not reduced within five business days, the Trust would not have a claim against the Custodian with respect to the digital assets held in such address to the extent the value exceeds the Cold Storage Threshold.\nThe shareholders recourse against the Sponsor and the Trusts other service providers for the services they provide to the Trust, including those relating to the provision of instructions relating to the movement of ZEN, is limited. Consequently, a loss may be suffered with respect to the Trusts ZEN that is not covered by insurance and for which no person is liable in damages. As a result, the recourse of the Trust or the shareholders, under New York law, is limited.\nThe Trust may be required, or the Sponsor may deem it appropriate, to terminate and liquidate at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.\nPursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, the Trust is required to dissolve under certain circumstances. In addition, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, dissolve the Trust for a number of reasons, including if the Sponsor determines, in its sole discretion, that it is desirable or advisable for any reason to discontinue the affairs of the Trust. For example, the Sponsor expects that it may be advisable to discontinue the affairs of the Trust if a federal court upholds an allegation that ZEN is a security under the federal securities laws, among other reasons. See Item 1. Business-Description of the Trust Agreement-The Trustee-Termination of the Trust.\nIf the Trust is required to terminate and liquidate, or the Sponsor determines in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement that it is appropriate to terminate and liquidate the Trust, such termination and liquidation could occur at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders, such as when the Actual Exchange Rate of ZEN is lower than the Reference Rate Price was at the time when shareholders purchased their Shares. In such a case, when the Trusts ZEN is sold as part of its liquidation, the resulting proceeds distributed to shareholders will be less than if the Actual Exchange Rate were higher at the time of sale. See Item 1. Business-Description of the Trust Agreement-The Trustee-Termination of the Trust for more information about the termination of the Trust, including when the termination of the Trust may be triggered by events outside the direct control of the Sponsor, the Trustee or the shareholders.\nThe Trust Agreement includes provisions that limit shareholders voting rights and restrict shareholders right to bring a derivative action.\nUnder the Trust Agreement, shareholders have limited voting rights and the Trust will not have regular shareholder meetings. Shareholders take no part in the management or control of the Trust. Accordingly, shareholders do not have the right to authorize actions, appoint service providers or take other actions as may be taken by shareholders of other trusts or companies where shares carry such rights. The shareholders limited voting rights give almost all control under the Trust Agreement to the Sponsor and the Trustee. The Sponsor may take actions in the operation of the Trust that may be adverse to the interests of shareholders and may adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nMoreover, pursuant to the terms of the Trust Agreement, shareholders statutory right under Delaware law to bring a derivative action (i.e., to initiate a lawsuit in the name of the Trust in order to assert a claim belonging to the Trust against a fiduciary of the Trust or against a third party when the Trusts management has refused to do so) is restricted. Under Delaware law, a shareholder may bring a derivative action if the shareholder is a shareholder at the time the action is brought and either (i) was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue or (ii) acquired the status of shareholder by operation of law or the Trusts governing instrument from a person who was a shareholder at the time of the transaction at issue. Additionally, Section 3816(e) of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act specifically provides that a beneficial owners right to bring a derivative action may be subject to such additional standards and restrictions, if any, as are set forth in the governing instrument of the statutory trust, including, without limitation, the requirement that beneficial owners owning a specified beneficial interest in the statutory trust join in the bringing of the derivative action. In addition to the requirements of applicable law and in accordance with Section 3816(e), the Trust Agreement provides that no shareholder will have the right, power or authority to bring or maintain a derivative action, suit or other proceeding on behalf of the Trust unless two or more shareholders who (i) are not Affiliates (as defined in the Trust Agreement and below) of one another and (ii) collectively hold at least 10.0% of the outstanding Shares join in the bringing or maintaining of such action, suit or other proceeding. This provision applies to any derivative actions brought in the name of the Trust other than claims under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.\nDue to this additional requirement, a shareholder attempting to bring or maintain a derivative action in the name of the Trust will be required to locate other shareholders with which it is not affiliated and that have sufficient Shares to meet the 10.0% threshold based on the number of Shares outstanding on the date the claim is brought and thereafter throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding. This may be difficult and may result in increased costs to a shareholder attempting to seek redress in the name of the Trust in court. Moreover, if shareholders bringing a derivative action, suit or proceeding pursuant to this provision of the Trust Agreement do not hold 10.0% of the outstanding Shares on the date such an action, suit or proceeding is brought, or such shareholders are unable to maintain Share ownership meeting the 10.0% threshold throughout the duration of the action, suit or proceeding, such shareholders derivative action may be subject to dismissal. As a result, the Trust Agreement limits the likelihood that a shareholder will be able to successfully assert a derivative action in the name of the Trust, even if such shareholder believes that he or she has a valid derivative action, suit or other proceeding to bring on behalf of the Trust. See Item 1. Business-Description of the Trust Agreement-The Sponsor-Fiduciary and Regulatory Duties of the Sponsor for more detail.\nThe Sponsor is solely responsible for determining the value of the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share and any errors, discontinuance or changes in such valuation calculations may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.\nThe Sponsor will determine the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share on a daily basis as soon as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each business day. The Sponsors determination is made utilizing data from the operations of the Trust and the Reference Rate Price, calculated at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day. If the Sponsor determines in good faith that the Reference Rate does not reflect an accurate ZEN price, then the Sponsor will employ an alternative method to determine the Reference Rate Price under the cascading set of rules set forth in Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Determination of the Reference Rate Price When Reference Rate Price is Unavailable. In the context of applying such rules, the Sponsor may determine in good faith that the alternative method applied does not reflect an accurate ZEN price and apply the next alternative method under the cascading set of rules. If the Sponsor determines after employing all of the alternative methods that the Reference Rate Price does not reflect an accurate ZEN price, the Sponsor will use its best judgment to determine a good faith estimate of the Reference Rate Price. There are no predefined criteria to make a good faith assessment in these scenarios and such decisions will be made by the Sponsor in its sole discretion. The Sponsor may calculate the Reference Rate Price in a manner that ultimately inaccurately reflects the price of ZEN. To the extent that the Digital Asset Holdings, Digital Asset Holdings per Share or the Reference Rate Price are incorrectly calculated, the Sponsor may not be liable for any error and such misreporting of valuation data could adversely affect the value of the Shares and investors could suffer a substantial loss on their investment in the Trust. Moreover, the terms of the Trust Agreement do not prohibit the Sponsor from changing the Reference Rate Price used to calculate the Digital Asset Holdings and Digital Asset Holdings per Share of the Trust. Any such change in the Reference Rate Price could affect the value of the Shares and investors could suffer a substantial loss on their investment in the Trust.\nExtraordinary expenses resulting from unanticipated events may become payable by the Trust, adversely affecting the value of the Shares.\nIn consideration for the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor has contractually assumed all ordinary-course operational and periodic expenses of the Trust. See Item 1. Business-Expenses; Sales of ZEN. Extraordinary expenses incurred by the Trust, such as taxes and governmental charges; expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Incidental Rights and any IR Virtual Currency); or extraordinary legal fees and expenses are not assumed by the Sponsor and are borne by the Trust. The Sponsor will cause the Trust to either (i) sell ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency held by the Trust or (ii) deliver ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in-kind to the Sponsor to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor on an as-needed basis. Accordingly, the Trust may be required to sell or otherwise dispose of ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency at a time when the trading prices for those assets are depressed.\nThe sale or other disposition of assets of the Trust in order to pay extraordinary expenses could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares for several reasons. These include the following factors:\nThe Trust is not actively managed and no attempt will be made to protect against or to take advantage of fluctuations in the prices of ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. Consequently, if the Trust incurs expenses in U.S. dollars, the Trusts ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency may be sold at a time when the values of the disposed assets are low, resulting in a negative impact on the value of the Shares.\nBecause the Trust does not generate any income, every time that the Trust pays expenses, it will deliver ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to the Sponsor or sell ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. Any sales of the Trusts assets in connection with the payment of expenses will decrease the amount of the Trusts assets represented by each Share each time its assets are sold or transferred to the Sponsor.\nAssuming that the Trust is a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery or sale of ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency by the Trust to pay the Sponsors Fee and/or Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event to beneficial owners of Shares. Thus, the Trusts payment of expenses could result in beneficial owners of Shares incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the Trust. Any such tax liability could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. See Item 1. Business-Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.\nThe Trusts delivery or sale of ZEN to pay expenses or other operations of the Trust could result in shareholders incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the Trust.\nAssuming that the Trust is treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each delivery of ZEN by the Trust to pay the Sponsors Fee or other expenses and each sale of ZEN by the Trust to pay Additional Trust Expenses will be a taxable event to beneficial owners of Shares. Thus, the Trusts payment of expenses could result in beneficial owners of Shares incurring tax liability without an associated distribution from the Trust. Any such tax liability could adversely affect an investment in the Shares. See Item 1. Business-Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.\nThe value of the Shares will be adversely affected if the Trust is required to indemnify the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent or the Custodian under the Trust Documents.\nUnder the Trust Documents, each of the Sponsor, the Trustee, the Transfer Agent and the Custodian has a right to be indemnified by the Trust for certain liabilities or expenses that it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part. Therefore, the Sponsor, Trustee, Transfer Agent or the Custodian may require that the assets of the Trust be sold in order to cover losses or liability suffered by it. Any sale of that kind would reduce the Digital Asset Holdings of the Trust and the value of the Shares.\nIntellectual property rights claims may adversely affect the Trust and the value of the Shares.\nThe Sponsor is not aware of any intellectual property rights claims that may prevent the Trust from operating and holding ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. However, third parties may assert intellectual property rights claims relating to the operation of the Trust and the mechanics instituted for the investment in, holding of and transfer of ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. Regardless of the merit of an intellectual property or other legal action, any legal expenses to defend or payments to settle such claims would be extraordinary expenses that would be borne by the Trust through the sale or transfer of its ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. Additionally, a meritorious intellectual property rights claim could prevent the Trust from operating and force the Sponsor to terminate the Trust and liquidate its ZEN, Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency. As a result, an intellectual property rights claim against the Trust could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nPandemics, epidemics and other natural and man-made disasters could negatively impact the value of the Trusts holdings and/or significantly disrupt its affairs.\nPandemics, epidemics and other natural and man-made disasters could negatively impact demand for digital assets, including ZEN, and disrupt the operations of many businesses, including the businesses of the Trusts service providers. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic had serious adverse effects on the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in increased volatility and uncertainty in economies and financial markets of many countries and in the Digital Asset Markets. Moreover, governmental authorities and regulators throughout the world have in the past responded to major economic disruptions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a variety of fiscal and monetary policy changes, such as quantitative easing, new monetary programs and lower interest rates. An unexpected or quick reversal of any such policies, or the ineffectiveness of such policies, could increase volatility in economies and financial market generally, and could specifically increase volatility in the Digital Asset Markets, which could adversely affect the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares.\nIn addition, pandemics, epidemics and other natural and man-made disasters could disrupt the operations of many businesses. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, many governments imposed in travel restrictions and prolonged, closed international borders and enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, which disrupted businesses around the world. While the Sponsor and the Trust were not materially impacted by these events, any disruptions to the Sponsors, the Trusts or the Trusts service providers business operations resulting from business restrictions, quarantines or restrictions on the ability of personnel to perform their jobs as a result of any future pandemic, epidemic or other disaster could have an adverse impact on the Trusts ability to access critical services and could be disruptive to the affairs of the Trust.\nRisk Factors Related to the Regulation of Digital Assets, the Trust and the Shares\nA determination that ZEN or any other digital asset is a security may adversely affect the value of ZEN and the value of the Shares, and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Trust.\nDepending on its characteristics, a digital asset may be considered a security under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a security is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities. More recently, the SEC has also brought enforcement actions against digital asset exchanges for operating unregistered securities exchanges on the basis that certain of the digital assets traded on their platforms are securities.\nFor example, in June 2023, the SEC brought charges against Binance and Coinbase for alleged violations of a variety of securities laws. In its complaints, the SEC asserted that SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, COTI, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH and NEXO, are securities under the federal securities laws. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought similar charges against Kraken, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.\nWhether a digital asset is a security under the federal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition of security in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Digital assets as such do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms investment contract and note, and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular digital asset is a security by reference to whether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts interpreting these terms, known as the Howey and Reves tests, respectively. For many digital assets, whether or not the Howey or Reves tests are met is difficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and against a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the Howey and Reves tests. Adding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the security status of a particular digital asset can change over time as the relevant facts evolve.\nAs part of determining whether ZEN is a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the Sponsor takes into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of security under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Courts decisions in the Howey and Reves cases, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC, its commissioners and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Finally, the Sponsor discusses the security status of ZEN with external counsel, and has received a memorandum regarding the status of ZEN under the federal securities laws from external counsel. Through this process the Sponsor believes that it is applying the proper legal standards in determining that ZEN is not a security in light of the uncertainties inherent in the Howey and Reves tests. The Sponsor has been contacted by staff from the SECs Divisions of Corporation Finance and Enforcement concerning the Sponsors securities law analysis of ZEN, and has responded to the SEC staff. In light of these uncertainties and the fact-based nature of the analysis, the Sponsor acknowledges that ZEN may currently be a security, based on the facts as they exist today, or may in the future be found by the SEC or a federal court to be a security under the federal securities laws notwithstanding the Sponsors prior conclusion; and the Sponsors prior conclusion, even if reasonable under the circumstances, would not preclude legal or regulatory action based on the presence of a security.\nAs is the case with ZEN, analyses from counsel typically review the often-complex facts surrounding a particular digital assets underlying technology, creation, use case and usage development, distribution and secondary-market trading characteristics as well as contributions of the individuals or organizations who appear to be involved in these activities, among other relevant facts, usually drawing on publicly available information. This information, usually found on the Internet, often includes both information that originated with or is attributed to such individuals or organizations, as well as information from third-party sources and databases that may or may not have a connection to such individuals or organizations, and the availability and nature of such information can change over time. The Sponsor and counsel often have no independent means of verifying the accuracy or completeness of such information, and therefore of necessity usually must assume that such information is materially accurate and complete for purposes of the Howey and Reves analyses. After having gathered this information, counsel typically analyzes it in light of the Howey and Reves tests, in order to inform a judgment as to whether or not a federal court would conclude that the digital asset in question is or is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Often, certain factors appear to support a conclusion that the digital asset in question is a security, while other factors appear to support the opposite conclusion, and in such a case counsel endeavors to weigh the importance and relevance of the competing factors. This analytical process is further complicated by the fact that, at present, federal judicial case law applying the relevant tests to digital assets is limited and in some situations inconsistent, with no federal appellate court having considered the question on the merits, as well as the fact that because each digital asset presents its own unique set of relevant facts, it is not always possible to directly analogize the analysis of one digital asset to another. Because of this factual complexity and the current lack of a well-developed body of federal case law applying the relevant tests to a variety of different fact patterns, the Sponsor has not in the past received, and currently does not expect that it would be able to receive, opinions of counsel stating that a particular digital asset is or is not a security for federal securities law purposes. The Sponsor understands that as a matter of practice, counsel is generally able to render a legal opinion only when the relevant facts are substantially ascertainable and the applicable law is both well-developed and settled. As a result, given the relative novelty of digital assets, the challenges inherent in fact-gathering for particular digital assets, and the fact that federal courts have only recently been tasked with adjudicating the applicability of federal securities law to digital assets, the Sponsor understands that at present counsel is generally not in a position to render a legal opinion on the securities-law status of ZEN or any other particular digital asset.\nAs such, notwithstanding the Sponsors receipt of a memorandum regarding the status of ZEN under the federal securities laws from external counsel and the Sponsors view that ZEN is not a security, the SEC or a federal court may in the future take a different view as to the security status of ZEN.\nIf the Sponsor determines that ZEN is a security under the federal securities laws, whether that determination is initially made by the Sponsor itself, or because a federal court upholds an allegation that ZEN is a security, the Sponsor does not intend to permit the Trust to continue holding ZEN in a way that would violate the federal securities laws (and therefore would either dissolve the Trust or potentially seek to operate the Trust in a manner that complies with the federal securities laws, including the Investment Company Act). Because the legal tests for determining whether a digital asset is or is not a security often leave room for interpretation, for so long as the Sponsor believes there to be good faith grounds to conclude that the Trusts ZEN is not a security, the Sponsor does not intend to dissolve the Trust on the basis that ZEN could at some future point be finally determined to be a security.\nAny enforcement action by the SEC or a state securities regulator asserting that ZEN is a security, or a court decision to that effect, would be expected to have an immediate material adverse impact on the trading value of ZEN, as well as the Shares. This is because the business models behind most digital assets are incompatible with regulations applying to transactions in securities. If a digital asset is determined to be a security, it is likely to become difficult or impossible for the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used by non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the trading value of the digital asset is likely to significantly impact its liquidity and market participants ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars. Any assertion that a digital asset is a security by the SEC or another regulatory authority may have similar effects. For example, in 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the issuer of XRP, Ripple Labs, Inc., and two of its executives, alleging that they raised more than $1.3 billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. In the years prior to the SECs action, XRPs market capitalization at times reached over $140 billion. However, in the weeks following the SECs complaint, XRPs market capitalization fell to less than $10 billion, which was less than half of its market capitalization in the days prior to the complaint.\nLikewise, in the days following the announcement of the SECs complaints against Binance and Coinbase, the price of various digital assets, including BTC, ETH, and ZEN, declined significantly and may continue to decline as these cases advance through the federal court system. Subsequently, in July 2023, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that while XRP is not a security, certain sales of XRP to certain buyers amounted to investment contracts under the Howey test. The SEC has sought an interlocutory appeal of the district courts verdict that XRP is not a security, which appeal was denied by the district court in October 2023. Moreover, also in July 2023, another judge in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, in litigation between the SEC and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, suggested that he disagreed with the approach underlying the XRP decision. The SECs actions against Binance, Coinbase, XRPs issuer and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, as well as seemingly inconsistent views of different district court judges, underscore the continuing uncertainty around which digital assets are securities, and demonstrate that such factors as how long a digital asset has been in existence, how widely held it is, how large its market capitalization\nis and that it has actual usefulness in commercial transactions, ultimately may have no bearing on whether the SEC or a court will find it to be a security.\nIn addition, if ZEN is in fact a security, the Trust could be considered an unregistered investment company under SEC rules, which could necessitate the Trusts liquidation. In this case, the Trust and the Sponsor may be deemed to have participated in an illegal offering of securities and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be able to register the Trust under the Investment Company Act at such time or take such other actions as may be necessary to ensure the Trusts activities comply with applicable law, which could force the Sponsor to liquidate the Trust.\nMoreover, whether or not the Sponsor or the Trust were subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of any determination that its assets include securities, the Sponsor may nevertheless decide to terminate the Trust, in order, if possible, to liquidate the Trusts assets while a liquid market still exists. For example, in response to the SECs action against the issuer of XRP, certain significant market participants announced they would no longer support XRP and announced measures, including the delisting of XRP from major digital asset trading platforms, resulting in the Sponsors conclusion that it was likely to be increasingly difficult for U.S. investors, including Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP), an affiliate of the Trust, to convert XRP into U.S. dollars. The Sponsor subsequently dissolved Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP) and liquidated its assets. If the SEC or a federal court were to determine that ZEN is a security, it is likely that the value of the Shares of the Trust would decline significantly. Furthermore, if a federal court upholds an allegation that ZEN is a security, the Trust itself may be terminated and, if practical, its assets liquidated.\nRegulatory changes or actions by the U.S. Congress or any U.S. federal or state agencies may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of ZEN, mining activity or the operation of the Horizen Network or the Digital Asset Markets in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares.\nAs digital assets have grown in both popularity and market size, the U.S. Congress and a number of U.S. federal and state agencies (including FinCEN, SEC, CFTC, FINRA, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the IRS, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve and state financial institution and securities regulators) have been examining the operations of digital asset networks, digital asset users and the Digital Asset Markets, with particular focus on the extent to which digital assets can be used to launder the proceeds of illegal activities or fund criminal or terrorist enterprises and the safety and soundness of exchanges and other service providers that hold or custody digital assets for users. Many of these state and federal agencies have issued consumer advisories regarding the risks posed by digital assets to investors. Ongoing and future regulatory actions with respect to digital assets generally or ZEN in particular may alter, perhaps to a materially adverse extent, the nature of an investment in the Shares or the ability of the Trust to continue to operate.\nIn August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from falling between regulatory cracks, as well as for more resources to protect investors in this growing and volatile sector. The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking additional plenary authority to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. President Bidens March 9, 2022 Executive Order, asserting that technological advances and the rapid growth of the digital asset markets necessitate an evaluation and alignment of the United States Government approach to digital assets, signals an ongoing focus on digital asset policy and regulation in the United States. A number of reports issued pursuant to the Executive Order have focused on various risks related to the digital asset ecosystem, and have recommended additional legislation and regulatory oversight. There have also been several bills introduced in Congress that propose to establish additional regulation and oversight of the digital asset markets. In connection with these developments, the SEC has taken a number of actions. For example, in February 2023 the SEC proposed amendments to the custody rules under Rule 406(4)-2 of the Investment Advisers Act. The proposed rule changes would amend the definition of a qualified custodian under Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) and expand the current custody rule in 406(4)-2 to cover digital assets and related advisory activities. If enacted as proposed, these rules would likely impose additional regulatory requirements with respect to the custody and storage of digital assets and could lead to additional regulatory oversight of the digital asset ecosystem more broadly. Moreover, the failure of FTX in November 2022 and the resulting market turmoil substantially increased regulatory scrutiny in the United States and globally and led to SEC and criminal investigations, enforcement actions and other regulatory activity across the digital asset ecosystem. For example, in June 2023, the SEC brought enforcement actions against Binance and Coinbase, two of the largest digital asset trading platforms, alleging that Binance and Coinbase operated unregistered securities exchanges, brokerages and clearing agencies. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought similar charges against Kraken, alleging that it operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency.\nIt is difficult to predict whether, or when, any of these developments will lead to Congress granting additional authorities to the SEC or other regulators, what the nature of such additional authorities might be, how additional legislation and/or regulatory oversight might impact the ability of Digital Asset Markets to function or how any new regulations or changes to existing regulations might impact\nthe value of digital assets generally and ZEN held by the Trust specifically. The consequences of increased federal regulation of digital assets and digital asset activities could have a material adverse effect on the Trust and the Shares.\nLaw enforcement agencies have often relied on the transparency of blockchains to facilitate investigations. However, certain privacy-enhancing features have been historically introduced to a number of digital asset networks, including the Horizen Network. These features, including those adopted by the Horizen Network or which may be introduced on the Horizen Network in the future, may provide law enforcement agencies with less visibility into transaction-level data. Europol, the European Unions law enforcement agency, released a report in October 2017 noting the increased use of privacy-enhancing digital assets like Zcash and Monero in criminal activity on the internet. In August 2022, OFAC banned all U.S. citizens from using Tornado Cash, a digital asset protocol designed to obfuscate blockchain transactions, by adding certain Ethereum wallet addresses associated with the protocol to its Specially Designated Nationals list. Notable industry participants such as Centre, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, have reportedly complied with the sanctions and blacklisted the sanctioned addresses from interacting with their networks. In September 2022, the Digital Asset Exchange Huobi delisted seven digital assets with privacy preserving features, including ZEN, a move that Huobi explained was in compliance with the latest financial regulations. However, in September 2023, Horizen implemented an update intended to deprecate these privacy shields, with the intent of causing it to no longer be considered a privacy coin, and, following the update, the Horizen Network will no longer support transactions from unshielded addresses to shielded addresses. It is unclear the removal of those kinds of shielded transactions from Horizen would mitigate these concerns by regulators, law enforcement agencies, and other digital asset market participants.\nChanges in SEC policy could adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nThe effect of any future regulatory change on the Trust or the digital assets held by the Trust is impossible to predict, but such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares. In particular, the SEC has not yet approved the listing on a national securities exchange of any non-futures based digital-asset focused exchange-traded fund (ETF). If the SEC were to approve any such ETF in the future, such an ETF may be perceived to be a superior investment product offering exposure to digital assets compared to the Trust because the value of the shares issued by such an ETF would be expected to more closely track the ETFs net asset value than do Shares of the Trust, and investors may therefore favor investments in such ETFs over investments in the Trust. Any weakening in demand for the Shares compared to digital asset ETF shares could cause the value of the Shares to decline.\nCompeting industries may have more influence with policymakers than the digital asset industry, which could lead to the adoption of laws and regulations that are harmful to the digital asset industry.\nThe digital asset industry is relatively new, although its influence over public policy is increasing, and it does not have the same access to policymakers and lobbying organizations in many jurisdictions compared to industries with which digital assets may be seen to compete, such as banking, payments and consumer finance. Competitors from other, more established industries may have greater access to and influence with governmental officials and regulators and may be successful in persuading these policymakers that digital assets require heightened levels of regulation compared to the regulation of traditional financial services. As a result, new laws and regulations may be proposed and adopted in the United States and elsewhere, or existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in new ways, that disfavor or impose compliance burdens on the digital asset industry or digital asset platforms, which could adversely impact the value of ZEN and therefore the value of the Shares.\nRegulatory changes or other events in foreign jurisdictions may affect the value of the Shares or restrict the use of one or more digital assets, mining activity or the operation of their networks or the Digital Asset Exchange Market in a manner that adversely affects the value of the Shares.\nVarious foreign jurisdictions have, and may continue to adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect the digital asset network, the Digital Asset Markets, and their users, particularly Digital Asset Exchanges and service providers that fall within such jurisdictions regulatory scope. For example, if China or other foreign jurisdictions were to ban or otherwise restrict mining activity, including by regulating or limiting manufacturers ability to produce or sell semiconductors or hard drives in connection with mining, it would have a material adverse effect on digital asset networks (including the Horizen Network), the Digital Asset Market, and as a result, impact the value of the Shares.\nA number of foreign jurisdictions have recently taken regulatory action aimed at digital asset activities. China has made transacting in cryptocurrencies illegal for Chinese citizens in mainland China, and additional restrictions may follow. Both China and South Korea have banned initial coin offerings entirely and regulators in other jurisdictions, including Canada, Singapore and Hong Kong, have opined that initial coin offerings may constitute securities offerings subject to local securities regulations. In May 2021, the Chinese government announced renewed efforts to restrict cryptocurrency trading and mining activities, citing concerns about high energy consumption and its desire to promote financial stability. Regulators in the Inner Mongolia and other regions of China have proposed regulations that would create penalties for companies engaged in cryptocurrency mining activities and introduce heightened energy saving requirements on industrial parks, data centers and power plants providing electricity to cryptocurrency miners. The United Kingdoms Financial Conduct Authority published final rules in October 2020 banning the sale of derivatives and exchange traded notes\nthat reference certain types of digital assets, contending that they are ill-suited to retail investors citing extreme volatility, valuation challenges and association with financial crime. A new law, the Financial Services and Markets Act 2023 (FSMA), received royal assent in June 2023. The FSMA brings digital asset activities within the scope of existing laws governing financial institutions, markets and assets. In addition, the Parliament of the European Union approved the text of MiCA in April 2023, establishing a regulatory framework for digital asset services across the European Union. MiCA is intended to serve as a comprehensive regulation of digital asset markets and imposes various obligations on digital asset issuers and service providers. The main aims of MiCA are industry regulation, consumer protection, prevention of market abuse and upholding the integrity of digital asset markets. MiCA was formally approved by the European Unions member state in 2023 and is expected to come into effect in 2024. See Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-Government Oversight.\nForeign laws, regulations or directives may conflict with those of the United States and may negatively impact the acceptance of one or more digital assets by users, merchants and service providers outside the United States and may therefore impede the growth or sustainability of the digital asset economy in the European Union, China, Japan, Russia and the United States and globally, or otherwise negatively affect the value of ZEN. Moreover, other events, such as the interruption in telecommunications or internet services, cyber-related terrorist acts, civil disturbances, war or other catastrophes, could also negatively affect the digital asset economy in one or more jurisdictions. For example, Russias invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 led to volatility in digital asset prices, with an initial steep decline followed by a sharp rebound in prices. The effect of any future regulatory change or other events on the Trust or ZEN is impossible to predict, and such change could be substantial and adverse to the Trust and the value of the Shares.\nIf regulators or public utilities take actions that restrict or otherwise impact mining activities, there may be a significant decline in such activities, which could adversely affect the Horizen Network and the value of the Shares.\nConcerns have been raised about the electricity required to secure and maintain digital asset networks. For example, as of September 30, 2023, approximately 392 million tera hashes are performed every second in connection with mining on the Bitcoin network. As of September 30, 2023, approximately 1.8 giga hashes are performed every second in connection with mining on the Horizen Network. Although measuring the electricity consumed by this process is difficult because these operations are performed by various machines with varying levels of efficiency, the process consumes a significant amount of energy. The operations of the Horizen Network and other digital asset networks may also consume significant amounts of energy. Further, in addition to the direct energy costs of performing calculations on any given digital asset network, there are indirect costs that impact a networks total energy consumption, including the costs of cooling the machines that perform these calculations.\nDriven by concerns around energy consumption and the impact on public utility companies, various states and cities have implemented, or are considering implementing, moratoriums on mining activity in their jurisdictions. For example, in November 2022, New York imposed a two-year moratorium on new proof-of-work mining permits at fossil fuel plants in the state. A significant reduction in mining activity as a result of such actions could adversely affect the security of the Horizen Network by making it easier for a malicious actor or botnet to manipulate the Blockchain. See -If a malicious actor or botnet obtains control of more than 50% of the processing power on the Horizen Network, or otherwise obtains control over the Horizen Network through its influence over core developers or otherwise, such actor or botnet could manipulate the Horizen Network to adversely affect the value of the Shares or the ability of the Trust to operate. If regulators or public utilities take action that restricts or otherwise impacts mining activities, such actions could result in decreased security of a digital asset network, including the Horizen Network, and consequently adversely impact the value of the Shares.\nIf regulators subject an Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor to regulation as a money service business or money transmitter, this could result in extraordinary expenses to the Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor and also result in decreased liquidity for the Shares.\nTo the extent that the activities of any Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor cause it to be deemed a money services business under the regulations promulgated by FinCEN, such Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor may be required to comply with FinCEN regulations, including those that would mandate the Authorized Participant to implement anti-money laundering programs, make certain reports to FinCEN and maintain certain records. Similarly, the activities of an Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor may require it to be licensed as a money transmitter or as a digital asset business, such as under the NYDFS BitLicense regulation.\nSuch additional regulatory obligations may cause the Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor to incur extraordinary expenses. If the Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor decided to seek the required licenses, there is no guarantee that they will timely receive them. An Authorized Participant may instead decide to terminate its role as Authorized Participant of the Trust, or the Sponsor may decide to discontinue and wind up the Trust. An Authorized Participants decision to cease acting as such may decrease the liquidity of the Shares, which could adversely affect the value of the Shares, and termination of the Trust in response to the changed regulatory circumstances may be at a time that is disadvantageous to the shareholders.\nAdditionally, to the extent an Authorized Participant, the Trust or the Sponsor is found to have operated without appropriate state or federal licenses, it may be subject to investigation, administrative or court proceedings, and civil or criminal monetary fines and penalties, all of which would harm the reputation of the Trust or the Sponsor, decrease the liquidity, and have a material adverse effect on the price of, the Shares.\nRegulatory changes or interpretations could obligate the Trust or the Sponsor to register and comply with new regulations, resulting in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust.\nCurrent and future legislation, CFTC and SEC rulemaking and other regulatory developments may impact the manner in which ZEN is treated. In particular, ZEN may be classified by the CFTC as a commodity interest under the CEA or may be classified by the SEC as a security under U.S. federal securities laws. The Sponsor and the Trust cannot be certain as to how future regulatory developments will impact the treatment of ZEN under the law. In the face of such developments, the required registrations and compliance steps may result in extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to the Trust. If the Sponsor decides to terminate the Trust in response to the changed regulatory circumstances, the Trust may be dissolved or liquidated at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.\nTo the extent that ZEN is deemed to fall within the definition of a commodity interest under the CEA, the Trust and the Sponsor may be subject to additional regulation under the CEA and CFTC regulations. The Sponsor may be required to register as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser with the CFTC and become a member of the National Futures Association and may be subject to additional regulatory requirements with respect to the Trust, including disclosure and reporting requirements. These additional requirements may result in extraordinary, recurring and/or nonrecurring expenses of the Trust, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Shares. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trusts ZEN at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.\nTo the extent that ZEN is determined to be a security under U.S. federal securities laws, the Trust and the Sponsor may be subject to additional requirements under the Investment Company Act and the Sponsor may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. Such additional registration may result in extraordinary, recurring and/or non-recurring expenses of the Trust, thereby materially and adversely impacting the Shares. If the Sponsor determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Sponsor will terminate the Trust. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Trusts ZEN at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders.\nThe treatment of the Trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes is uncertain.\nThe Sponsor intends to take the position that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its pro rata share of the Trusts assets and a pro rata portion of the Trusts income, gain, losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of Shares.\nIf the IRS were to disagree with, and successfully challenge certain positions the Trust may take, including with respect to Incidental Rights and IR Virtual Currency, the Trust might not qualify as a grantor trust. In addition, the Sponsor has delivered the Pre-Creation Abandonment Notice to the Custodian stating that the Trust is irrevocably abandoning, effective immediately prior to each Creation Time, all Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency to which it would otherwise be entitled as of such time and with respect to which it has not taken any Affirmative Action at or prior to such time. There can be no complete assurance that these abandonments will be treated as effective for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the Trust were treated as owning any asset other than ZEN as of any date on which it creates Shares, it would likely cease to qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nBecause of the evolving nature of digital assets, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets, including forks, airdrops and other similar occurrences. Assuming that the Trust is currently a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, certain future developments could render it impossible, or impracticable, for the Trust to continue to be treated as a grantor trust for such purposes.\nIf the Trust is not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (as discussed below in Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences-Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Assets), there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing of the recognition of taxable income or loss. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of 21%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made\nby the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trusts current and accumulated earnings and profits. Any such dividend distributed to a beneficial owner of Shares that is a non-U.S. person for U.S. federal income tax purposes would be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate as provided in an applicable tax treaty).\nThe treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes is uncertain.\nAs discussed in the section entitled Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences-Uncertainty Regarding the U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of Digital Assets below, assuming that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as the owner of an undivided interest in the ZEN (and, if applicable, any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency) held in the Trust. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and the absence of comprehensive guidance with respect to digital assets, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets are uncertain.\nIn 2014, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released a notice (the Notice) discussing certain aspects of convertible virtual currency (that is, digital assets that have an equivalent value in fiat currency or that act as substitutes for fiat currency) for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, in particular, stating that such digital assets (i) are property (ii) are not currency for purposes of the rules relating to foreign currency gain or loss and (iii) may be held as a capital asset. In 2019, the IRS released a revenue ruling and a set of Frequently Asked Questions (the Ruling & FAQs) that provide some additional guidance, including guidance to the effect that, under certain circumstances, hard forks of digital assets are taxable events giving rise to ordinary income and guidance with respect to the determination of the tax basis of digital assets. However, the Notice and the Ruling & FAQs do not address other significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets. Moreover, although the Ruling & FAQs address the treatment of hard forks, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the timing and amount of the income inclusions.\nThere can be no assurance that the IRS will not alter its position with respect to digital assets in the future or that a court would uphold the treatment set forth in the Notice and the Ruling & FAQs. It is also unclear what additional guidance on the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future. Any such alteration of the current IRS positions or additional guidance could result in adverse tax consequences for shareholders and could have an adverse effect on the value of ZEN. Future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For example, the Notice addresses only digital assets that are convertible virtual currency, and it is conceivable that, as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence, the Trust will hold certain types of digital assets that are not within the scope of the Notice.\nShareholders are urged to consult their tax advisers regarding the tax consequences of owning and disposing of Shares and digital assets in general.\nFuture developments regarding the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nAs discussed above, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets, such as ZEN, are uncertain, and it is unclear what guidance on the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be issued in the future. It is possible that any such guidance would have an adverse effect on the prices of digital assets, including on the price of ZEN in the Digital Asset Markets, and therefore may have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.\nBecause of the evolving nature of digital assets, it is not possible to predict potential future developments that may arise with respect to digital assets, including forks, airdrops and similar occurrences. Such developments may increase the uncertainty with respect to the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Moreover, certain future developments could render it impossible, or impracticable, for the Trust to continue to be treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nFuture developments in the treatment of digital assets for tax purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes could adversely affect the value of the Shares.\nThe taxing authorities of certain states, including New York, (i) have announced that they will follow the Notice with respect to the treatment of digital assets for state income tax purposes and/or (ii) have issued guidance exempting the purchase and/or sale of digital assets for fiat currency from state sales tax. However, it is unclear what further guidance on the treatment of digital assets for state tax purposes may be issued in the future.\nThe treatment of digital assets for tax purposes by non-U.S. jurisdictions may differ from the treatment of digital assets for U.S. federal, state or local tax purposes. It is possible, for example, that a non-U.S. jurisdiction would impose sales tax or value-added tax on purchases and sales of digital assets for fiat currency. If a foreign jurisdiction with a significant share of the market of ZEN users imposes onerous tax burdens on digital asset users, or imposes sales or value-added tax on purchases and sales of digital assets for fiat currency, such actions could result in decreased demand for ZEN in such jurisdiction.\nAny future guidance on the treatment of digital assets for state, local or non-U.S. tax purposes could increase the expenses of the Trust and could have an adverse effect on the prices of digital assets, including on the price of ZEN in the Digital Asset Markets. As a result, any such future guidance could have an adverse effect on the value of the Shares.\nA U.S. tax-exempt shareholder may recognize unrelated business taxable income as a consequence of an investment in Shares.\nUnder the guidance provided in the Ruling & FAQs, hard forks, airdrops and similar occurrences with respect to digital assets will under certain circumstances be treated as taxable events giving rise to ordinary income. In the absence of guidance to the contrary, it is possible that any such income recognized by a U.S. tax-exempt shareholder would constitute unrelated business taxable income (UBTI). A tax-exempt shareholder should consult its tax adviser regarding whether such shareholder may recognize UBTI as a consequence of an investment in Shares.\nNon-U.S. Holders may be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax on income derived from forks, airdrops and similar occurrences.\nThe Ruling & FAQs do not address whether income recognized by a non-U.S. person as a result of a fork, airdrop or similar occurrence could be subject to the 30% withholding tax imposed on U.S.-source fixed or determinable annual or periodical income. Non-U.S. Holders (as defined under Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences-Tax Consequences to Non-U.S. Holders below) should assume that, in the absence of guidance, a withholding agent (including the Sponsor) is likely to withhold 30% of any such income recognized by a non-U.S. Holder in respect of its Shares, including by deducting such withheld amounts from proceeds that such non-U.S. Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive in connection with a distribution of Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency.\nRisk Factors Related to Potential Conflicts of Interest\nPotential conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor or its affiliates and the Trust. The Sponsor and its affiliates have no fiduciary duties to the Trust and its shareholders other than as provided in the Trust Agreement, which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of the Trust and its shareholders.\nThe Sponsor will manage the affairs of the Trust. Conflicts of interest may arise among the Sponsor and its affiliates, including the Authorized Participants, on the one hand, and the Trust and its shareholders, on the other hand. As a result of these conflicts, the Sponsor may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the Trust and its shareholders. These potential conflicts include, among others, the following:\nThe Sponsor has no fiduciary duties to, and is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than, the Trust and its shareholders in resolving conflicts of interest, provided the Sponsor does not act in bad faith;\nThe Trust has agreed to indemnify the Sponsor and its affiliates pursuant to the Trust Agreement;\nThe Sponsor is responsible for allocating its own limited resources among different clients and potential future business ventures, to each of which it owes fiduciary duties;\nThe Sponsor and its staff also service affiliates of the Sponsor, including several other digital asset investment vehicles, and their respective clients and cannot devote all of its, or their, respective time or resources to the management of the affairs of the Trust;\nThe Sponsor, its affiliates and their respective officers and employees are not prohibited from engaging in other businesses or activities, including those that might be in direct competition with the Trust;\nAffiliates of the Sponsor have substantial direct investments in ZEN that they are permitted to manage taking into account their own interests without regard to the interests of the Trust or its shareholders, and any increases, decreases or other changes in such investments could affect the Reference Rate Price and, in turn, the value of the Shares;\nThere is an absence of arms-length negotiation with respect to certain terms of the Trust, and, where applicable, there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to the Trust;\nThe Sponsors parent company, Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG), and Barry E. Silbert, who in his capacity as Chief Executive Officer of DCG has voting and dispositive power over the securities held by such entity, together hold a majority of the Shares representing ownership in the Trust, and the interests of such majority owners may conflict with the interests of the Trusts other shareholders. On March 2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor approved the purchase by DCG of up to $10 million worth of Shares of the Trust. Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. From March 2, 2022 through June 30, 2022, DCG purchased a total of $0.01 million worth of Shares of the Trust. From July 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, DCG had not purchased any Shares of the Trust under this authorization. In the event DCG chooses to purchase additional Shares of the Trust, such purchase would further increase DCGs and Mr. Silberts majority ownership interest in the Trust;\nSeveral employees of the Sponsor and the Sponsors parent company, DCG, are FINRA-registered representatives who historically maintained their licenses through Genesis and currently maintain their licenses through Grayscale Securities;\nDCG is (i) the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor, and parent company of Genesis, one of the Authorized Participants Liquidity Providers from October 3, 2022 through September 12, 2023, (ii) the indirect parent company of Grayscale Securities, the only acting Authorized Participant, as of the date of this Annual Report; (iii) formerly the indirect parent company of the Reference Rate Provider (prior to its sale to an unaffiliated third party on November 20, 2023); and (iv) a minority interest holder in Coinbase, Inc., which operates Coinbase, one of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate and the Trusts principal market, and which is the parent company of the Custodian, representing less than 1.0% of its equity;\nDCG has investments in a large number of digital assets and companies involved in the digital asset ecosystem, including exchanges and custodians. DCGs positions on changes that should be adopted in the Horizen Network could be adverse to positions that would benefit the Trust or its shareholders. Additionally, before or after a hard fork on the Horizen Network, DCGs position regarding which fork among a group of incompatible forks of the Horizen Network should be considered the true Horizen Network could be adverse to positions that would most benefit the Trust;\nDCG has been vocal in the past about its support for digital assets other than ZEN. Any investments in, or public positions taken on, digital assets other than ZEN by DCG could have an adverse impact on the price of ZEN;\nThe Sponsor decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for the Trust;\nThe Sponsor and Grayscale Securities, which acts as Authorized Participant and distributor and marketer for the Shares, are affiliated parties that share a common parent company, DCG;\nThe Sponsor and Genesis, which previously served as an Authorized Participant and distributor and marketer for the Shares, are affiliated parties that share a common parent company, DCG;\nThe Sponsor may appoint an agent to act on behalf of the shareholders, including in connection with the distribution of any Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency, and such agent may be the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor; and\nThe Sponsor has historically, and may again select a Reference Rate Provider that is an affiliate of the Sponsor and the Trust.\nBy purchasing the Shares, shareholders agree and consent to the provisions set forth in the Trust Agreement. See Item 1. Business-Description of the Trust Agreement.\nFor a further discussion of the conflicts of interest among the Sponsor, the distributor, the marketer, Authorized Participant, Liquidity Providers, the Trust and others, see Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nBecause the Sponsor and the Trusts sole Authorized Participant are affiliated with each other, the Trusts Baskets will not be exchanged for ZEN in arms-length transactions.\nThe Sponsor is the parent company of Grayscale Securities, LLC, a registered broker dealer currently acting as the sole Authorized Participant, distributor and marketer for the Shares. The Trust issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of ZEN. See Item 1. Business-Description of Creation of Shares. As the sole Authorized Participant, Grayscale Securities is currently the only entity that may place orders to create Creation Baskets. As a result, the issuance of Creation Baskets does not occur on an arms-length basis.\nWhile additional Authorized Participants may be added at any time, subject to the discretion of the Sponsor, the Sponsor may be disincentivized from replacing affiliated service providers due to its affiliated status. In connection with this conflict of interest, shareholders should understand that affiliated service providers will receive fees for providing services to the Trust. Clients of the affiliated service providers may pay commissions at negotiated rates that are greater or less than the rate paid by the Trust. The Sponsor may have an incentive to resolve questions between Grayscale Securities, on the one hand, and the Trust and shareholders, on the other hand, in favor of Grayscale Securities (including, but not limited to, questions as to the calculation of the Basket Amount).\nDCG is a minority interest holder in Coinbase, Inc., one of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate Price.\nDCG, the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor, holds a minority interest of less than 1.0% in Coinbase, Inc., which operates Coinbase. The Sponsor values its digital assets by reference to the Reference Rate Price. The Reference Rate Price is the price in U.S. dollars of a ZEN derived from the Digital Asset Exchanges that are reflected in the Reference Rate developed by CoinDesk Indices, Inc. as of 4:00 p.m., New York time on each business day. Coinbase is one of such Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate.\nAlthough DCG does not exercise control over Coinbase, it is possible that investors could have concerns that DCG could influence market data provided by this Digital Asset Exchange in a way that benefits DCG, for example by artificially inflating the values of ZEN in order to increase the Sponsors fees. This could make the Trusts Shares less attractive to investors than the shares of similar vehicles that do not present these concerns, adversely affect investor sentiment about the Trust and negatively affect Share trading prices.\nDCG holds a minority interest in the parent company of the Custodian, which could lead DCG to cause the Sponsor to take actions that favor the Custodians interests over the Trusts interests.\nCoinbase, Inc. is also the parent company of the Custodian, Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC. The Custodian serves as a fiduciary and custodian on the Trusts behalf, and is responsible for safeguarding the ZEN and Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency held by the Trust, and holding the private keys that provide access to the Trusts digital wallets and vaults. DCGs minority interest of less than 1.0% in the parent company of the Custodian may present risks to shareholders to the extent DCG causes the Sponsor to favor the Custodians interests over the interests of the Trust or its shareholders with respect to, for example, fees charged and the quality of service provided by the Custodian. Similarly, it is possible that investors could have concerns that DCGs interest in Coinbase, Inc. could cause it to refrain from taking actions that are in the best interests of the Trust but that could harm the Custodian. This could make the Trusts Shares less attractive to investors than the shares of similar vehicles that do not present these concerns, adversely affect investor sentiment about the Trust and negatively affect Share trading prices.\nShareholders cannot be assured of the Sponsors continued services, the discontinuance of which may be detrimental to the Trust.\nShareholders cannot be assured that the Sponsor will be willing or able to continue to serve as sponsor to the Trust for any length of time. If the Sponsor discontinues its activities on behalf of the Trust and a substitute sponsor is not appointed, the Trust will terminate and liquidate its ZEN.\nAppointment of a substitute sponsor will not guarantee the Trusts continued operation, successful or otherwise. Because a substitute sponsor may have no experience managing a digital asset financial vehicle, a substitute sponsor may not have the experience, knowledge or expertise required to ensure that the Trust will operate successfully or continue to operate at all. Therefore, the appointment of a substitute sponsor may not necessarily be beneficial to the Trust and the Trust may terminate. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence-The Sponsor.\nAlthough the Custodian is a fiduciary with respect to the Trusts assets, if the Custodian resigns or is removed by the Sponsor or otherwise, without replacement, it would trigger early termination of the Trust.\nThe Custodian is a fiduciary under \u00a7 100 of the New York Banking Law and a qualified custodian for purposes of Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6) under the Investment Advisers Act, and is licensed to custody the Trusts ZEN in trust on the Trusts behalf. However, the SEC has recently released proposed amendments to rule 206(4)-2 that, if enacted as proposed, would amend the definition of a qualified custodian under Rule 206(4)-2(d)(6). Executive officers of the Custodians parent company have made public statements indicating that the Custodian will remain a qualified custodian under the proposed SEC rule, if enacted as currently proposed. However, there can be no assurance that the Custodian would continue to qualify as a qualified custodian under a final rule.\nFurthermore, during the initial term, the Custodian may terminate the Custodian Agreement for Cause (as defined in Description of the Custodian Agreement-Termination) at any time, and after the initial term, the Custodian can terminate the Agreement for any reason upon the notice period provided under the Custodian Agreement. If the Custodian resigns or is removed by the Sponsor or otherwise, without replacement, the Trust will dissolve in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.\nShareholders may be adversely affected by the lack of independent advisers representing investors in the Trust.\nThe Sponsor has consulted with counsel, accountants and other advisers regarding the formation and operation of the Trust. No counsel was appointed to represent investors in connection with the formation of the Trust or the establishment of the terms of the Trust Agreement and the Shares. Moreover, no counsel has been appointed to represent an investor in connection with the offering of the Shares. Accordingly, an investor should consult his, her or its own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of the value of the Shares. Lack of such consultation may lead to an undesirable investment decision with respect to investment in the Shares. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nNone. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nThe Sponsor and an affiliate of the Trust, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (Grayscale Bitcoin Trust), are currently parties to certain legal proceedings. Although the Trust is not a party to these proceedings, the Trust may in the future be subject to legal proceedings or disputes.\nOn November 18, 2022, the Sponsor received a letter on behalf of Fir Tree Master Fund, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (together, Fir Tree) demanding access to certain of the Sponsors and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts books and records pursuant to Section 3819 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and certain provisions under the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust disputed Fir Trees entitlement to the requested books and records and, therefore, declined to comply with the demand. On December 6, 2022, Fir Tree filed a suit in Delaware Chancery Court (the Fir Tree Action) against the Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust alleging that the Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated Fir Trees information rights and seeking to compel access to the requested books and records.\nOn January 13, 2023, the Sponsor received a letter on behalf of 210K Capital, LP (210K Capital) demanding access to certain of the Sponsors and Grayscale Bitcoin Trusts books and records pursuant to Section 3819 of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act and certain provisions under the Trust Agreement. The Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust disputed 210K Capitals entitlement to the requested books and records and, therefore, declined to comply with the demand. On March 6, 2023, 210K Capital filed a suit in Delaware Chancery Court (the 210K Capital Action and, together with the Fir Tree Action, the Demands) against the Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust alleging that the Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated 210K Capitals information rights and seeking to compel access to the requested books and records.\nOn July 10, 2023, the Sponsor, Fir Tree, and 210K Capital entered into a Settlement Agreement which resolved the Demands, in which the Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust agreed to voluntarily produce certain books and records in response to the Demands without any admission of liability or fault, without conceding the shareholders entitlement to any information, and without the payment of any money. On September 21, 2023, Fir Tree and 210K Capital filed stipulations of dismissal for the Demands.\nOn January 30, 2023, Osprey Funds, LLC (Osprey) filed a suit in Connecticut Superior Court against the Sponsor alleging that statements the Sponsor made in its advertising and promotion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 17, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and, following briefing, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on June 26, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the Court denied the Sponsors motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2023, the Sponsor filed a motion for reargument of the Courts order denying the Sponsors motion to dismiss. The Sponsor and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it.\nIn October 2021, NYSE Arca filed a proposal with the SEC pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act for a rule change to list the Shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange traded product, and on June 29, 2022, the SEC issued a final order disapproving NYSE Arcas proposed rule change. On June 29, 2022, the Sponsor filed a petition for review of the SECs final order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On August 29, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the Sponsors petition and vacated the SECs order as arbitrary and capricious. The SEC did not seek panel rehearing, or rehearing en banc. On October 23, 2023, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the matter to the SEC. There is no guarantee that the ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals will ultimately result in approval of NYSE Arcas 19b-4 application to list the shares of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust on NYSE Arca as an exchange traded product. Moreover, even if NYSE Arcas request with respect to Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is approved, there is no guarantee that a similar application to list Shares of the Trust on NYSE Arca, or another national securities exchange, would also be approved.\nOn March 6, 2023, Alameda Research, Ltd. (Alameda) filed a suit against the Sponsor, DCG, Michael Sonnenshein and Barry Silbert in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware alleging various breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims, including that the defendants had breached the terms of the trust agreements of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) for failing to reduce the Sponsors fees and operate a redemption program (the Initial Complaint). On April 4, 2023, the Sponsor, DCG, Michael Sonnenshein and Barry Silbert moved to dismiss the Initial Complaint. On May 19, 2023, the Sponsor filed a brief in support of its motion to dismiss. On September 15, 2023, Alameda filed an amended complaint (the Amended Complaint) alleging breach of contract and fiduciary duty claims concerning the Sponsors purported failure to operate a redemption program that are substantially similar to those alleged in the Initial Complaint. The Amended Complaint eliminated certain causes of action asserted in the Initial Complaint concerning purported breaches of the terms of the trust agreements and breaches of fiduciary duty by the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust and Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) for failing to reduce their Sponsors fees. The Sponsor believes this lawsuit is without merit and intends to vigorously defend against it.\nAs of the date of this report, the Sponsor does not expect the foregoing proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Trusts business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nMarket Information\nPrior to October 3, 2022, Shares were distributed by Genesis, acting as the sole Authorized Participant, through sales in private placement transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Rule 506(c) thereunder. Since October 3, 2022, Grayscale Securities has been the only acting Authorized Participant of the Trust and has engaged Liquidity Provider(s) to source ZEN on its behalf in connection with the creation of Shares. The Shares are quoted on OTCQX under the ticker symbol HZEN. Over-the-counter market quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nHolders of Record\nAs of September 30, 2023, there were approximately 22 holders of record. This includes Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC for the Shares traded on OTCQX, but not its direct participants. Therefore, this number does not include the individual holders who have bought Shares on OTCQX or transferred their eligible Shares to their brokerage accounts. Because most of the Trusts Shares are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of shareholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of shareholders represented by these record holders.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Shares\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Registrant has distributed 6,838,000 Shares at varying prices determined by reference to the Digital Asset Holdings per Share to selected accredited investors, within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act. The Shares were sold in connection with an ongoing offering pursuant to Rule 506(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Genesis acted as the Authorized Participant with respect to these distributions. In exchange for these sales, the Trust received an aggregate of 666,351.02062050 ZEN. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Registrant did not distribute any Shares. Because Shares have been, and continue to be, created and issued on a periodic basis, a distribution, as such term is used in the Securities Act, may be occurring from time to time. As a result, the Authorized Participant facilitating the creation of Shares and acting as a distributor and marketer during any such period may be deemed an underwriter under Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid to the Authorized Participant with respect to such sales.\nPurchases of Equity Securities\nPurchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers -The table below sets forth information regarding open market purchases of Shares of Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (OTCQX: HZEN) by Digital Currency Group, Inc.

Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. The Share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any specific number of Shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. From March 2, 2022 through June 30, 2022, DCG purchased $0.01 million worth of Shares of the Trust under this authorization. From July 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, DCG had not purchased any Shares of the Trust under this authorization. Item 6. [Reserved] Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements.\nTrust Overview\nThe Trust is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Sponsor and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Trust holds ZEN and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of ZEN. As a passive investment vehicle, the Trusts investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on ZEN per Share) to reflect the value of ZEN held by the Trust, determined by reference to the Reference Rate Price, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in ZEN, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to ZEN. To date, the Trust has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of ZEN held by the Trust, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Trust is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. On October 7, 2021, the Trust completed a 10-for-1 Share split (the Share Split) of the Trusts issued and outstanding Shares. Each Shareholder of record as of the close of business on October 6, 2021 received 9 additional Shares of the Trust for each Share held. The number of outstanding Shares and per-Share amounts disclosed for all periods prior to October 7, 2021 have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Share Split.\nAs of September 30,\n2021(1)\nNumber of Shares authorized\nUnlimited\nUnlimited\nUnlimited\nNumber of Shares outstanding\n6,838,000\n6,838,000\n6,838,000\nNumber of Shares freely tradable(2)\n3,278,635\n3,210,776\nNumber of beneficial holders owning at least 100 Shares(3)\nNumber of holders of record(3)\n(1)Share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 10-for-1 Share Split of the Trusts issued and outstanding Shares completed on October 7, 2021.\n(2)Includes the total number of Shares that are not restricted securities as such term is defined under Rule 144.\n(3)Includes Cede & Co. as nominee for DTC for the Shares traded on OTCQX, but not its direct participants. Therefore, this number does not include the individual holders who have bought/sold Shares on OTCQX or transferred their eligible Shares to their brokerage accounts.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInvestment Transactions and Revenue Recognition\nThe Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of ZEN for Share creations and the delivery of ZEN for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in ZEN. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsors Fee in ZEN.\nPrincipal Market and Fair Value Determination\nTo determine which market is the Trusts principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trusts net asset value (NAV), the Trust follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for ZEN in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that ZEN is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nThe Trust only receives ZEN in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or its Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant(s), may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets, each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets).\nIn determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trusts principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order:\nFirst, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with AML and KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Exchange Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market.\nSecond, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of ZEN traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months.\nThird, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market.\nFourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Trusts principal market.\nThe Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Markets trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Markets price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trusts determination of its principal market.\nThe cost basis of ZEN received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of ZEN at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.\nInvestment Company Considerations\nThe Trust is an investment company for GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services -Investment Companies. The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for ZEN in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.\nReview of Financial Results\nFinancial Highlights for the Years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\n(All amounts in the following table and the subsequent paragraphs, except Share, per Share, ZEN and price of ZEN amounts, are in thousands)\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\nNet realized and unrealized (loss) gain on investment\n$\n(3,873\n)\n$\n(34,585\n)\n$\n36,797\nNet (decrease) increase in net assets resulting from operations\n$\n(4,020\n)\n$\n(35,249\n)\n$\n35,981\nNet assets\n$\n4,671\n$\n8,691\n$\n43,940\nNet realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN for the year ended September 30, 2023 was ($3,873), which includes a realized loss of ($164) on the transfer of ZEN to pay the Sponsors Fee and net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in ZEN\nof ($3,709). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN for the year was driven by ZEN price depreciation from $14.10 per ZEN as of September 30, 2022, to $7.77 per ZEN as of September 30, 2023. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was ($4,020) for the year ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN, plus the Sponsors Fee of $147. Net assets decreased to $4,671 at September 30, 2023, a 46% decrease for the year. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned ZEN price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 15,218 ZEN to pay the foregoing Sponsors Fee.\nNet realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN for the year ended September 30, 2022 was ($34,585), which includes a realized gain of $346 on the transfer of ZEN to pay the Sponsors Fee and net change in unrealized depreciation on investment in ZEN of ($34,931). Net realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN for the year was driven by ZEN price depreciation from $69.53 per ZEN as of September 30, 2021, to $14.10 per ZEN as of September 30, 2022. Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was ($35,249) for the year ended September 30, 2022, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investment in ZEN, plus the Sponsors Fee of $664. Net assets decreased to $8,691 at September 30, 2022, an 80% decrease for the year. The decrease in net assets resulted from the aforementioned ZEN price depreciation and the withdrawal of approximately 15,604 ZEN to pay the foregoing Sponsors Fee.\nNet realized and unrealized gain on investment in ZEN for the year ended September 30, 2021 was $36,797, which includes a realized gain of $568 on the transfer of ZEN to pay the Sponsors Fee and net change in unrealized appreciation on investment in ZEN of $36,229. Net realized and unrealized gain on investment in ZEN for the year was driven by ZEN price appreciation from $5.67 per ZEN as of September 30, 2020, to $69.53 per ZEN as of September 30, 2021. Net increase in net assets resulting from operations was $35,981 for the year ended September 30, 2021, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized gain on investment in ZEN, less the Sponsors Fee of $816. Net assets increased to $43,940 at September 30, 2021, a 1656% increase for the year. The increase in net assets resulted from the aforementioned ZEN price appreciation and the contribution of approximately 188,581 ZEN, with a value of $5,457 to the Trust in connection with Share creations during the period, partially offset by the withdrawal of approximately 14,286 ZEN to pay the foregoing Sponsors Fee.\nCash Resources and Liquidity\nThe Trust has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in the Digital Asset Market to pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, the Sponsor endeavors to sell the exact number of ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Trusts holdings of assets other than ZEN. As a consequence, the Sponsor expects that the Trust will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Trust is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nIn exchange for the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the periods covered by this Annual Report was the Sponsors Fee. The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.\nSelected Operating Data\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2021(1)\n(All ZEN balances are rounded to the nearest whole ZEN)\nHorizen:\nOpening balance\n616,357\n615,586\n441,291\nCreations including repayment of ZEN receivable,\nrelated party(2)\n-\n16,375\n188,581\nSponsors Fee, related party\n(15,218\n)\n(15,604\n)\n(14,286\n)\nClosing balance\n601,139\n616,357\n615,586\nAccrued but unpaid Sponsors Fee, related party\n-\n-\n-\nNet closing balance\n601,139\n616,357\n615,586\nNumber of Shares:\nOpening balance\n6,838,000\n6,838,000\n4,657,000\nCreations\n-\n-\n2,181,000\nClosing balance\n6,838,000\n6,838,000\n6,838,000\nSeptember 30,\n2021(1)\nPrice of ZEN on principal market(3)\n$\n7.77\n$\n14.10\n$\n69.53\nNAV per Share(4)\n$\n0.68\n$\n1.27\n$\n6.43\nReference Rate Price(5)\n$\n7.78\n$\n14.13\n$\n68.07\nDigital Asset Holdings per Share(5)\n$\n0.68\n$\n1.27\n$\n6.29\n(1)Share and per Share amounts for periods presented prior to the Share Split have been retroactively adjusted for the 10-for-1 Share Split of the Trusts issued and outstanding Shares completed on October 7, 2021.\n(2)Creations for the year ended September 30, 2021 include a receivable representing the contribution of 16,375.40469036 ZEN not yet delivered by the Authorized Participant at the time, Genesis, for Shares issued by the Trust during the year ended September 30, 2021.

Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price for a description of the Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price. Effective June 16, 2023, the Reference Rate Provider removed Binance.US from the Reference Rate due to Binance.USs announcement that the exchange was suspending U.S. dollar deposits and withdrawals and planned to delist its U.S. dollar trading pairs, and did not add any Constituent Exchanges as part of its review. As a result of this removal, there were no longer sufficient Constituent Exchanges for the Reference Rate Provider to continue producing the Reference Rate pursuant to the Constituent Exchange selection methodology described in Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Constituent Exchange Selection. If the Reference Rate becomes unavailable, the Sponsor employs an alternative method to determine the Reference Rate Price under the cascading set of rules set forth in Item 1.

At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval from the SEC and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Trust had a net closing balance with a value of $4,676,858, based on the Reference Rate Price (non-GAAP methodology).

Investors, however, should also be aware that past movements in the ZEN price are not indicators of future movements. Movements may be influenced by various factors, including, but not limited to, government regulation, security breaches experienced by service providers, as well as political and economic uncertainties around the world.\nThe following chart illustrates the movement in the Trusts Digital Asset Holdings per Share (as adjusted for the Share Split for periods prior to October 7, 2021) versus the Reference Rate Price and the Trusts NAV per Share as calculated in accordance with GAAP (as adjusted for the Share Split for periods prior to October 7, 2021) from August 6, 2018 (the inception of the Trusts operations) to September 30, 2023.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSee Index to Financial Statements on page for a list of the financial statements being filed therein. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nThere have been no disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosures during the year ended September 30, 2023. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, and to the audit committee of the board of directors of the Sponsor, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor, the Sponsor conducted an evaluation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Trusts disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Sponsors management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined under Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Trusts internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Trusts assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Trusts receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Trusts assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become ineffective because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor assessed the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, they used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Their assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Based on their assessment and those criteria, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer of the Sponsor concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nBecause we are an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for so long as we are an emerging growth company.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Trusts internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the Trusts most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, these internal controls.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence\nGeneral\nThe Sponsor has not established formal procedures to resolve all potential conflicts of interest. Consequently, shareholders may be dependent on the good faith of the respective parties subject to such conflicts to resolve them equitably. Although the Sponsor attempts to monitor these conflicts, it is extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the Sponsor to ensure that these conflicts do not, in fact, result in adverse consequences to the Trust.\nThe Sponsor presently intends to assert that shareholders have, by subscribing for Shares of the Trust, consented to the following conflicts of interest in the event of any proceeding alleging that such conflicts violated any duty owed by the Sponsor to investors.\nDigital Currency Group, Inc.\nDigital Currency Group, Inc. is (i) the sole member and parent company of the Sponsor, and parent company of Genesis, one of the Authorized Participants Liquidity Providers from October 3, 2022 through September 12, 2023, (ii) the indirect parent company of Grayscale Securities, the only acting Authorized Participant, as of the date of this Annual Report, (iii) formerly the indirect parent company of the Reference Rate Provider (prior to its sale to an unaffiliated third party on November 20, 2023), and (iv) a minority interest holder in Coinbase, Inc., which operates Coinbase, one of the Digital Asset Exchanges included in the Reference Rate, and which is also the parent company of the Custodian, representing less than 1.0% of its equity.\nDigital Currency Group, Inc. has investments in a large number of digital assets and companies involved in the digital asset ecosystem, including exchanges and custodians. Digital Currency Group, Inc.s positions on changes that should be adopted in the Horizen Network could be adverse to positions that would benefit the Trust or its shareholders. Additionally, before or after a hard fork, Digital Currency Group, Inc.s position regarding which fork among a group of incompatible forks of the Horizen Network should be considered the true Horizen Network could be adverse to positions that would most benefit the Trust.\nThe Sponsor\nThe Sponsor has a conflict of interest in allocating its own limited resources among, when applicable, different clients and potential future business ventures, to each of which it owes fiduciary duties. Additionally, the professional staff of the Sponsor also services other affiliates of the Trust, including several other digital asset investment vehicles, and their respective clients. Although the Sponsor and its professional staff cannot and will not devote all of its or their respective time or resources to the management of the affairs of the Trust, the Sponsor intends to devote, and to cause its professional staff to devote, sufficient time and resources to manage properly the affairs of the Trust consistent with its or their respective fiduciary duties to the Trust and others.\nThe Sponsor and Grayscale Securities are affiliates of each other, and the Sponsor may engage other affiliated service providers in the future. Because of the Sponsors affiliated status, it may be disincentivized from replacing affiliated service providers. In connection with this conflict of interest, shareholders should understand that affiliated service providers will receive fees for providing services to the Trust. Clients of the affiliated service providers may pay commissions at negotiated rates which are greater or less than the rate paid by the Trust.\nThe Sponsor and any affiliated service provider may, from time to time, have conflicting demands in respect of their obligations to the Trust and, in the future, to other clients. It is possible that future business ventures of the Sponsor and affiliated service providers may generate larger fees, resulting in increased payments to employees, and therefore, incentivizing the Sponsor and/or the affiliated service providers to allocate it/their limited resources accordingly to the potential detriment of the Trust.\nThere is an absence of arms length negotiation with respect to some of the terms of the Trust, and, where applicable, there has been no independent due diligence conducted with respect to the Trust. The Sponsor will, however, not retain any affiliated service providers for the Trust which the Sponsor has reason to believe would knowingly or deliberately favor any other client over the Trust.\nThe Authorized Participant\nPrior to October 3, 2022, Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor, was the only Authorized Participant and was party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust. Since October 3, 2022, the only Authorized Participant is Grayscale Securities, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor. As a result of this affiliation, the Sponsor has an incentive to resolve questions between Grayscale Securities, on the one hand, and the Trust and shareholders, on the other hand, in favor of Grayscale Securities (including, but not limited to, questions as to the calculation of the Basket Amount). Lastly, several employees of the Sponsor and Digital Currency Group, Inc. are FINRA-registered representatives who maintain their licenses through Grayscale Securities.\nPrior to September 12, 2023, Grayscale Securities had engaged Genesis, an affiliate of the Trust and the Sponsor, to act as one of its Liquidity Providers. In its capacity as a Liquidity Provider of Grayscale Securities, Genesis engaged in ZEN trading with the Trusts affiliated entities. For example, when the Sponsor received the Sponsors Fee in ZEN, it sold the ZEN through Genesis. For this service, Genesis charged the Sponsor a transaction fee, which was not borne by the Trust. Additionally, the Sponsors parent company, Digital Currency Group, Inc., is the sole shareholder and parent company of Genesis, in addition to a customer of Genesis, and may buy or sell ZEN through Genesis from time to time, independent of the Trust. As of September 12, 2023, Genesis no longer serves as a Liquidity Provider of Grayscale Securities.\nProprietary Trading/Other Clients\nBecause the officers of the Sponsor may trade ZEN for their own personal trading accounts (subject to certain internal trading policies and procedures) at the same time as they are managing the account of the Trust, the activities of the officers of the Sponsor, subject to their fiduciary duties, may, from time-to-time, result in their taking positions in their personal trading accounts which are opposite of the positions taken for the Trust. Records of the Sponsors officers personal trading accounts will not be available for inspection by shareholders.\nThe Reference Rate Provider\nDigital Currency Group, Inc. was the indirect parent company of the Reference Rate Provider until the Reference Rate Provider was sold by Digital Currency Group, Inc. to an unaffiliated third party in November 2023. Prior to its sale by Digital Currency Group, Inc., the Reference Rate Provider was an affiliate of the Sponsor and the Trust and had an incentive to resolve questions regarding, or changes to, the manner in which the Reference Rate was constructed and in which the Reference Rate Price was calculated in a way that favored the Sponsor and the Trust. Effective June 20, 2023, the Reference Rate Price is determined by the Secondary Reference Rate Provider, Coin Metrics, Inc., which is not an affiliate of the Trust. See Item 1. Business-Overview of the ZEN Industry and Market-ZEN Value-The Reference Rate and the Reference Rate Price-Determination of the Reference Rate Price when Reference Rate Price is Unavailable. Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services\nFees for services performed by Marcum LLP and Friedman LLP, prior to the acquisition of certain assets of Friedman LLP by Marcum LLP effective September 1, 2022, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were:\nYears Ended September 30,\n2022(1)\nAudit fees\n$\n68,250\n$\n87,140\nTotal\n$\n68,250\n$\n87,140\n(1)The Sponsor was notified that certain assets of Friedman LLP (Friedman), the Trusts independent registered public accounting firm, were acquired by Marcum LLP (Marcum) effective September 1, 2022. On September 27, 2022, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Sponsor approved the dismissal of Friedman and the engagement of Marcum to serve as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Trust. As of September 1, 2022, the services previously provided by Friedman are provided by Marcum.\nIn the table above, in accordance with the SECs definitions and rules, Audit Fees are fees paid to Marcum for professional services for the audit of the Trusts financial statements included in the annual report on Form 10-K and review of financial statements included in the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and for services that are normally provided by the accountants in connection with regulatory filings or engagements.\nPre-Approved Policies and Procedures\nThe Trust has no board of directors, and as a result, has no audit committee or pre-approval policy with respect to fees paid to its principal accounting firm. Such determinations, including for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, are made by the Sponsors Board of Directors and Audit Committee.\nPART IV Item 15.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Trust as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the management of the Trusts Sponsor, Grayscale Investments, LLC. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Trust in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Trust is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Trust's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nEmphasis of Matter - Investment in ZEN\nIn forming our opinion we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures included in Note 7 to the financial statements concerning among other things the risks and uncertainties related to the Trusts investment in ZEN and Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency that arise as a result of the Trusts investment in ZEN. The risks and rewards to be recognized by the Trust associated with its investment in ZEN will be dependent on many factors outside of the Trusts control. The currently immature nature of the ZEN market including clearing, settlement, custody and trading mechanisms, the dependency on information technology to sustain ZEN continuity, as well as valuation and volume volatility all subject ZEN to unique risks of theft, loss, or other misappropriation as well as valuation uncertainty. Furthermore, these factors also contribute to the significant uncertainty with respect to the future viability and value of ZEN. Our opinion is not qualified in respect to this matter.\n/s/ Marcum LLP\nWe have served as the Trusts auditor since 2018 (such date takes into account the acquisition of certain assets of Friedman LLP by Marcum LLP effective September 1, 2022).\nNew York, New York\nNovember 21, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Sponsor of\nGrayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN)\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the statements of operations and changes in net assets of Grayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (the Trust) for the year ended September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements).

Organization\nGrayscale Horizen Trust (ZEN) (the Trust) is a Delaware Statutory Trust that was formed on July 3, 2018 and commenced operations on August 6, 2018. In general, the Trust holds Horizen (ZEN) and, from time to time, issues common units of fractional undivided beneficial interest (Shares) (in minimum baskets of 100 Shares, referred to as Baskets) in exchange for ZEN. The redemption of Shares is not currently contemplated and the Trust does not currently operate a redemption program. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program. The Trusts investment objective is for the value of the Shares (based on ZEN per Share) to reflect the value of ZEN held by the Trust, less the Trusts expenses and other liabilities. The Trust may also receive Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency as a result of the Trusts investment in ZEN, in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.\nIncidental Rights are rights to claim, or otherwise establish dominion and control over, any virtual currency or other asset or right, which rights are incident to the Trusts ownership of ZEN and arise without any action of the Trust, or of the Sponsor or Trustee on behalf of the Trust; IR Virtual Currency is any virtual currency tokens, or other asset or right, received by the Trust through the exercise (subject to the applicable provisions of the Trust Agreement) of any Incidental Right.\nGrayscale Investments, LLC (Grayscale or the Sponsor) acts as the Sponsor of the Trust and is a wholly owned subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, Inc. (DCG). The Sponsor is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Agreement. Grayscale is responsible for preparing and providing annual and quarterly reports on behalf of the Trust to investors and is also responsible for selecting and monitoring the Trusts service providers. As partial consideration for the Sponsors services, the Trust pays Grayscale a Sponsors Fee as discussed in Note 6. The Sponsor also acts as the sponsor and manager of other investment products including Grayscale Basic Attention Token Trust (BAT) (OTCQB: GBAT), Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (OTCQX: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Chainlink Trust (LINK) (OTCQB: GLNK), Grayscale Decentraland Trust (MANA) (OTCQX: MANA), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (OTCQX: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC) (OTCQX: ETCG), Grayscale Filecoin Trust (FIL) (OTCQB: FILG), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC) (OTCQX: LTCN), Grayscale Livepeer Trust (LPT) (OTCQB: GLIV), Grayscale Solana Trust (SOL) (OTCQB: GSOL), Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM) (OTCQX: GXLM), Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZEC) (OTCQX: ZCSH), Grayscale Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Fund LLC (OTCQB: DEFG), Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC (OTCQX: GDLC), and Grayscale Smart Contract Platform Ex Ethereum (ETH) Fund LLC, each of which is an affiliate of the Trust. The following investment products sponsored or managed by the Sponsor are also SEC reporting companies with their shares registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act): Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC), Grayscale Litecoin Trust (LTC), Grayscale Stellar Lumens Trust (XLM), Grayscale Zcash Trust (ZEC), and Grayscale Digital Large Cap Fund LLC. Grayscale Advisors, LLC, a Registered Investment Advisor and an affiliate of the Sponsor, is the advisor to the Grayscale Future of Finance (NYSE: GFOF) product.\nAuthorized Participants of the Trust are the only entities who may place orders to create or, if permitted, redeem Baskets. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. (Genesis or, in such capacity, an Authorized Participant), a registered broker-dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of DCG, was the only Authorized Participant prior to October 3, 2022 and was party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust. Effective October 3, 2022, Grayscale Securities, LLC (Grayscale Securities or, in such capacity, an Authorized Participant), a registered broker-dealer and wholly owned subsidiary of the Sponsor, is the only Authorized Participant, and is party to a participant agreement with the Sponsor and the Trust. As a result, since October 3, 2022, Genesis ceased acting as an Authorized Participant of the Trust, but served as a Liquidity Provider to Grayscale Securities from October 3, 2022 through September 12, 2023. The Authorized Participant has engaged an unaffiliated Liquidity Provider, and intends to engage additional Liquidity Providers who are unaffiliated with the Trust in the future.\nThe custodian of the Trust is Coinbase Custody Trust Company, LLC (the Custodian), a third-party service provider. The Custodian is responsible for safeguarding the ZEN, Incidental Rights, and IR Virtual Currency held by the Trust, and holding the private key(s) that provide access to the Trusts digital wallets and vaults.\nThe transfer agent for the Trust (the Transfer Agent) is Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company. The responsibilities of the Transfer Agent are to maintain creations, redemptions, transfers, and distributions of the Trusts Shares which are primarily held in book-entry form.\nOn October 18, 2021, the Trust received notice that its Shares were qualified for public trading on the OTCQX U.S. Marketplace of the OTC Markets Group Inc. (OTCQX). The Trusts trading symbol on OTCQX is HZEN and the CUSIP number for its Shares is 38963T101.\nOn October 7, 2021, the Trust completed a 10-for-1 Share Split of the Trusts issued and outstanding Shares. Each beneficial owner of a Share (a shareholder) of record as of the close of business on October 6, 2021 received nine additional Shares of the Trust for each Share held. The number of outstanding Shares and per-Share amounts disclosed for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of the Share Split.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust:\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Trust qualifies as an investment company for accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting and reporting guidance under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946, Financial Services-Investment Companies. The Trust uses fair value as its method of accounting for ZEN in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Trust is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.\nThe Trust conducts its transactions in ZEN, including receiving ZEN for the creation of Shares and delivering ZEN for the redemption of Shares and for the payment of the Sponsors Fee. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. Since its inception, the Trust has not held cash or cash equivalents.\nPrincipal Market and Fair Value Determination\nTo determine which market is the Trusts principal market (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Trusts net asset value (NAV), the Trust follows ASC 820-10, which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for ZEN in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Trust to assume that ZEN is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact.\nThe Trust only receives ZEN in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or its Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Trust looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider on behalf of the Authorized Participant(s), may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets, each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets).\nIn determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Trusts principal market, the Trust reviews these criteria in the following order:\nFirst, the Trust reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) regulations, and non-Digital Asset Exchange Markets that the Trust reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market.\nSecond, the Trust sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of ZEN traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months.\nThird, the Trust then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market.\nFourth, the Trust then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Trust, Exchange Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset. The Trust therefore looks to accessible Exchange Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, an Exchange Market has been selected as the Trusts principal market.\nThe Trust determines its principal market (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Markets trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Trust has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to\neach Digital Asset Markets price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Trusts determination of its principal market.\nThe cost basis of ZEN received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Trust at the fair value of ZEN at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors.\nInvestment Transactions and Revenue Recognition\nThe Trust considers investment transactions to be the receipt of ZEN for Share creations and the delivery of ZEN for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in ZEN. At this time, the Trust is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Trust records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Sponsors Fee in ZEN.\nFair Value Measurement\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the \u2018exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nGAAP utilizes a fair value hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Trust. Unobservable inputs reflect the Trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.\nThe fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, these valuations do not entail a significant degree of judgment.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.\nThe availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary by investment. To the extent that valuations are based on sources that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Fair value estimates do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized by the Trust.\nFair Value Measurement Using\n(Amounts in thousands)\nAmount at\nFair Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nSeptember 30, 2023\nAssets\nInvestment in ZEN\n$\n4,671\n$\n4,671\n$\n-\n$\n-\nSeptember 30, 2022\nAssets\nInvestment in ZEN\n$\n8,691\n$\n8,691\n$\n-\n$\n-\n3. Fair Value of Horizen\nZEN is held by the Custodian on behalf of the Trust and is carried at fair value. As of September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Trust held 601,138.55454194, 616,356.97722875 and 615,585.26478971 ZEN, respectively.\nThe Trust determined the fair value per ZEN to be $7.77, $14.10 and $69.53 on September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, using the price provided at 4:00 p.m., New York time, by the Digital Asset Exchange Market considered to be the Trusts principal market.\nHistorically, the Trust considered the Digital Asset Brokered Market to be its principal market. The Trust performed an assessment of the principal market at December 31, 2021 and identified a change in the principal market from the Digital Asset Brokered Market to Coinbase.\nThe following represents the changes in quantity of ZEN and the respective fair value:\n(Amounts in thousands, except ZEN amounts)\nQuantity\nFair Value\nBalance at September 30, 2020\n441,290.85330434\n$\n2,502\nZEN contributed, net of ZEN receivable, related party\n188,580.88160629\n4,318\nZEN distributed for Sponsors Fee, related party\n(14,286.47012092\n)\n(816\n)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation on investment in ZEN\n-\n36,229\nNet realized gain on investment in ZEN\n-\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n615,585.26478971\n$\n42,801\nReceipt of ZEN receivable, related party\n16,375.40469036\n1,139\nZEN distributed for Sponsors Fee, related party\n(15,603.69225132\n)\n(664\n)\nNet change in unrealized depreciation on investment in ZEN\n-\n(34,931\n)\nNet realized gain on investment in ZEN\n-\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n616,356.97722875\n$\n8,691\nZEN contributed\n-\n-\nZEN distributed for Sponsors Fee, related party\n(15,218.42268681\n)\n(147\n)\nNet change in unrealized depreciation on investment in ZEN\n-\n(3,709\n)\nNet realized loss on investment in ZEN\n-\n(164\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2023\n601,138.55454194\n$\n4,671\n4. Creations and Redemptions of Shares\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were an unlimited number of Shares authorized by the Trust. The Trust creates (and, should the Trust commence a redemption program, redeems) Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets. The creation and redemption of Baskets on behalf of investors are made by the Authorized Participant in exchange for the delivery of ZEN to the Trust or the distribution of ZEN by the Trust. The number of ZEN required for each creation Basket or redemption Basket is determined by dividing (x) the number of ZEN owned by the Trust at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such trade date of a creation or redemption order, after deducting the number of ZEN representing the U.S. dollar value of accrued but unpaid fees and expenses of the Trust, by (y) the number of Shares outstanding at such time and multiplying the quotient obtained by 100. Each Share represented approximately 0.0879 and 0.0901 of one ZEN at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in the number of ZEN represented by each Share since inception is primarily a result of the Share Split and, to a lesser degree, the periodic withdrawal of ZEN to pay the Sponsors Fee.\nThe cost basis of investments in ZEN recorded by the Trust is the fair value of ZEN, as determined by the Trust, at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the date of transfer to the Trust by the Authorized Participant based on the creation Baskets. The cost basis recorded by the Trust may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of each Share to investors. The Authorized Participant may realize significant profits buying, selling, creating, and, if permitted, redeeming Shares as a result of changes in the value of Shares or ZEN.\nAt this time, the Trust is not operating a redemption program and is not accepting redemption requests. Subject to receipt of regulatory approval and approval by the Sponsor in its sole discretion, the Trust may in the future operate a redemption program. The Trust currently has no intention of seeking regulatory approval to operate an ongoing redemption program.\n5. Income Taxes\nThe Sponsor takes the position that the Trust is properly treated as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Assuming that the Trust is a grantor trust, the Trust will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Rather, if the Trust is a grantor trust, each beneficial owner of Shares will be treated as directly owning its pro rata Share of the Trusts assets and a pro rata portion of the Trusts income, gain, losses and deductions will flow through to each beneficial owner of Shares.\nIf the Trust were not properly classified as a grantor trust, the Trust might be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, due to the uncertain treatment of digital assets, including forks, airdrops and similar occurrences for U.S. federal income tax purposes, there can be no assurance in this regard. If the Trust were classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the tax consequences of owning Shares generally would not be materially different from the tax consequences described herein, although there might be certain differences, including with respect to timing. In addition, tax information reports provided to beneficial owners of Shares would be made in a different form. If the Trust were not classified as either a grantor trust or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, it would be classified as a corporation for such purposes. In that event, the Trust would be subject to entity-level U.S. federal income tax (currently at the rate of 21%) on its net taxable income and certain distributions made by the Trust to shareholders would be treated as taxable dividends to the extent of the Trusts current and accumulated earnings and profits.\nIn accordance with GAAP, the Trust has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of and during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Trust did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Sponsors conclusions concerning its determination of more-likely-than-not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.\nThe Sponsor of the Trust has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2023 or 2022.\n6. Related Parties\nThe Trust considered the following entities, their directors, and certain employees to be related parties of the Trust as of September 30, 2023: DCG, Genesis, Grayscale, Grayscale Securities, and CoinDesk Indices, Inc. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, 3,607,534 and 3,643,924, Shares of the Trust were held by related parties of the Trust, respectively.\nThe Sponsors parent, an affiliate of the Trust, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than 1.0% of Coinbase, Inc.s ownership.\nIn accordance with the Trust Agreement governing the Trust, the Trust pays a fee to the Sponsor, calculated as 2.5% of the aggregate value of the Trusts assets, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Sponsor or its delegates in the manner set forth in the Trust Agreement (the Sponsors Fee). The Sponsors Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in ZEN, monthly in arrears. The amount of ZEN payable in respect of each daily U.S. dollar accrual will be determined by reference to the same U.S. dollar value of ZEN used to determine such accrual. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of ZEN is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Exchange Market that the Trust considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date. The Trust held no Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currency as of September 30, 2023 and 2022. No Incidental Rights or IR Virtual Currencies have been distributed in payment of the Sponsors Fee during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nAs partial consideration for receipt of the Sponsors Fee, the Sponsor is obligated under the Trust Agreement to assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Trust in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; administrator fees, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to $600,000 in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act; printing and mailing costs; the costs of maintaining the Trusts website and applicable license fees (the Sponsor-paid Expenses), provided that any expense that qualifies as an Additional Trust Expense will be deemed to be an Additional Trust Expense and not a Sponsor-paid Expense.\nThe Trust may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Sponsor-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Sponsor (or any other service\nprovider) on behalf of the Trust to protect the Trust or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Incidental Rights and any IR Virtual Currency), any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Trust, the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) to the extent exceeding $600,000 in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively Additional Trust Expenses). In such circumstances, the Sponsor or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the Digital Asset Account ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Trust Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Trust (or its delegate) to convert such ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the Actual Exchange Rate or (y) when the Sponsor incurs such expenses on behalf of the Trust, cause the Trust (or its delegate) to deliver such ZEN, Incidental Rights and/or IR Virtual Currency in kind to the Sponsor in satisfaction of such Additional Trust Expenses.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Trust incurred Sponsors Fees of $146,899, $664,009 and $815,977, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, there were no accrued and unpaid Sponsors Fees. In addition, the Sponsor may pay Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust, which are reimbursable by the Trust to the Sponsor. For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Sponsor did not pay any Additional Trust Expenses on behalf of the Trust.\nOn March 2, 2022, the Board of the Sponsor (the Board) approved the purchase by DCG, the parent company of the Sponsor, of up to $10 million worth of Shares of the Trust. Subsequently, DCG authorized such purchase. The Share purchase authorization does not obligate DCG to acquire any specific number of Shares in any period, and may be expanded, extended, modified, or discontinued at any time. From March 2, 2022 through June 30, 2022, DCG purchased $0.01 million worth of Shares of the Trust. From July 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, DCG had not purchased any Shares of the Trust under this authorization.\n7. Risks and Uncertainties\nThe Trust is subject to various risks including market risk, liquidity risk, and other risks related to its concentration in a single asset, ZEN. Investing in ZEN is currently highly speculative and volatile.\nThe net asset value of the Trust relates primarily to the value of ZEN held by the Trust, and fluctuations in the price of ZEN could materially and adversely affect an investment in the Shares of the Trust. The price of ZEN has a limited history. During such history, ZEN prices have been volatile and subject to influence by many factors, including the levels of liquidity. If Digital Asset Markets continue to experience significant price fluctuations, the Trust may experience losses. Several factors may affect the price of ZEN, including, but not limited to, global ZEN supply and demand, theft of ZEN from global exchanges or vaults, competition from other forms of digital currency or payment services, global or regional political, economic or financial conditions, and other unforeseen events and situations.\nThe ZEN held by the Trust are commingled and the Trusts shareholders have no specific rights to any specific ZEN. In the event of the insolvency of the Trust, its assets may be inadequate to satisfy a claim by its shareholders.\nThere is currently no clearing house for ZEN, nor is there a central or major depository for the custody of ZEN. There is a risk that some or all of the Trusts ZEN could be lost or stolen. There can be no assurance that the Custodian will maintain adequate insurance or that such coverage will cover losses with respect to the Trusts ZEN. Further, transactions in ZEN are irrevocable. Stolen or incorrectly transferred ZEN may be irretrievable. As a result, any incorrectly executed ZEN transactions could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) has stated that certain digital assets may be considered securities under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a security is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ethereum to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. The SEC staff also provided informal assurances to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities.\nIf ZEN is determined to be a security under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for ZEN. For example, it may become more difficult for ZEN to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other digital assets that are not considered to be securities, which could, in turn, negatively affect the liquidity and general acceptance of ZEN and cause users to migrate to other digital assets. As such, any determination that ZEN is a security under federal or state securities laws may adversely affect the value of ZEN and, as a result, an investment in the Shares.\nIn addition, if ZEN is in fact a security, the Trust could be considered an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which could necessitate the Trusts liquidation. In this case, the Trust and the Sponsor may be deemed to have participated in an illegal offering of securities and there is no guarantee that the Sponsor will be able to register the Trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940 at such time or take such other actions as may be necessary to ensure the Trusts activities comply with applicable law, which could force the Sponsor to liquidate the Trust.\nTo the extent a private key required to access a ZEN address is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private keys are accessible, the Trust may be unable to access the ZEN controlled by the private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the Horizen Network. The processes by which ZEN transactions are settled are dependent on the peer-to-peer network, and as such, the Trust is subject to operational risk. A risk also exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of ZEN.\nThe Trust relies on third-party service providers to perform certain functions essential to its operations. Any disruptions to the Trusts service providers business operations resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems could have an adverse impact on the Trusts ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Trust.\nThe Sponsor and the Trust may be subject to various litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of its business.\n8.

Indemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, the Trust enters into certain contracts that provide a variety of indemnities, including contracts with the Sponsor and affiliates of the Sponsor, DCG and its officers, directors, employees, subsidiaries and affiliates, and the Custodian as well as others relating to services provided to the Trust. The Trusts maximum exposure under these and its other indemnities is unknown. However, no liabilities have arisen under these indemnities in the past and, while there can be no assurances in this regard, there is no expectation that any will occur in the future. Therefore, the Sponsor does not consider it necessary to record a liability in this regard.\n11. Subsequent Events\nAs of the close of business on November 16, 2023, the fair value of ZEN determined in accordance with the Trusts accounting policy was $10.95 per ZEN.\nOn November 20, 2023 it was announced that the Reference Rate Provider was acquired by an unaffiliated third party. This transaction is not expected to have any impact on the Trust, or disrupt the operations of the Trust.\nThere are no known events that have occurred that require disclosure other than that which has already been disclosed in these notes to the financial statements."
