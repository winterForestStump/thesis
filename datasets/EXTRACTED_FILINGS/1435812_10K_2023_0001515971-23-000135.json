BUSINESS\nCorporate History and Business Development\nWe were incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 8, 2007, under the name Aspen Global Corp. On June 10, 2008, we changed our name to Diversified Mortgage Workout Corp.\nOn June 30, 2012, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement with Sanyi Group, we acquired 100% of the equity interest in Sanyi Group from its sole owner, Mr. Xin Jin, our current sole director, CEO and CFO, in consideration of 10,000,000 post-split (as defined below) shares of our $0.000001 par value common stock comprised of restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 of the SEC, which were issued to Mr. Jin on August 30, 2013. On the closing of this acquisition, we succeeded to the business operations of Sanyi Group, then consisting of the operation of two (2) wellness centers discussed below.\nOn June 19, 2013, Arem Pacific Arizona acquired voting control of the Company (then Diversified Workout Corporation). Subsequently, on August 8, 2013, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Arem Pacific Arizona from its then existing shareholders; and we retired and returned to our treasury all of the capital stock acquired in the Arem Pacific Arizona transaction, resulting in it becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary.\nWe changed our name in Delaware to Arem Pacific Corporation on July 23, 2013; and we effected a 388 to one (1) reverse stock split of our common stock on or about that date. Effective April 15, 2016, our Form S-1 Registration Statement registering shares of our common stock for public sale by certain selling shareholders of the Company was declared effective by the SEC. We became delinquent in our reports required to be filed under Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act on or about February 15, 2017, but filed a comprehensive Annual Report on Form 10-K on November 21, 2022 and have filed all quarterly reports required since that time.\nOur current corporate structure is depicted below:\nArem Pacific Corporation\n(a Delaware corporation)\n100% owned\nArem Pacific Corporation\n(an Arizona corporation)\n100% owned\nSanyi Group Pty. Ltd.\nan Australian corporation\nFor additional information about our corporate structure, please see the caption References and the heading Corporate History and Business Development above. All of our current principal operations are conducted through Sanyi Group in Victoria, Australia.\nBusiness\nOverview\nThrough Sanyi Group, we are engaged in providing wellness services that include acupressure/reflexology, massage therapy and cupping. We offer various types of massage therapy, such as Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others, all as discussed below.\nPrincipal Products or Services and their Markets\nSince 2017, we have operated one (1) wellness center in Victoria State, Australia. The wellness center is located Point Cook Shopping Center, Shop 109, Stockland Point Cook, Corner Murong and 20 Main Street, Point Cook, Victoria, 3030.\nThe Point Cook wellness center consists of approximately seventy-seven (77) square meters, and its layout is depicted below:\nThe Point Cook location has one (1) full-time supervisor and two (2) part-time masseurs as at June 30, 2023. The size of any future planned locations, if any, are anticipated to range between fifty (50) to one hundred (100) square meters.\nServices Provided at our Wellness Center.\nWe provide the following services at our wellness center:\n\u00b7 Acupressure/Reflexology;\n\u00b7 Neck, shoulder, back, legs and full body massages;\n\u00b7 Foot massages;\n\u00b7 Cupping; and\n\u00b7 Deep tissue and hot oil massages.\nAcupressure/Reflexology - is considered acupuncture without needles. Similar to acupuncture, strategic body meridians are targeted by the practitioner using pressure from their fingers, elbows or special devices. Acupressure also is a component of traditional Chinese medicine. Reflexology is similar to acupressure and targets specific points on the feet and hands, which correspond to organs in the body.\nMassage Therapy - involves the application of soft tissue manipulation techniques to the body designed to reduce muscle tension and increase circulation. There are many variations of massage therapy, including Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others. It is believed that massage therapy was practiced in many ancient civilizations, including China, India and Greece.\nCupping - involves the warming of glass cups through a flammable substance, which eliminates oxygen, thus creating a vacuum. The cup is then placed over a specific area. The lack of oxygen anchors the cup, and the suction draws the skin, which simulates blood flow to the area. This process is considered the inverse of massage. Cupping is one of the oldest forms of Chinese medicine.\nThese wellness services are provided by skilled practitioners trained in massage therapy, acupressure and cupping. Sessions vary from fifteen (15) to ninety (90) minutes and prices vary according to the nature of the services and length of services session.\nOur Revenue Model.\nWe generate revenues from the following methods:\nFees for services are charged to our customers dependent upon the treatment administered and length of time of the treatment. Computed on an hourly basis, these fees generally range from $60 to $85 per hour.\nRevenue derived from an average customer is approximately $60 per visit. At our locations, each masseur averages eight (8) customers/day (eight [8] hours of operation) or forty eight (48) customers/week (six [6] working days) or 2,400 customers/year (fifty [50] weeks). An average of three (3) masseurs yields approximate sales revenue of $400,000-450,000 annualized. Although our average has been eight (8) customers a day per each masseur, we believe that each masseur is capable of serving up to ten (10) customers per day.\nOur Masseurs.\nOur wellness center location is staffed with between three (3) to six (6) masseurs and one (1) supervisor. The supervisor is our most experienced masseur at the wellness center. The supervisor oversees the day-to-day operations of the wellness center and may serve customers during personnel shortages. Our masseurs are employees and are paid a yearly salary of approximately $53,900, depending on experience. In addition, we are required by applicable law to pay our full and part-time employees Public Liability Insurance, which is approximately $446 yearly for each employee, including Professional Indemnity Insurance at a cost of (0.6%) of the employees salary. From time to time, we use independent contractors during personnel shortages, and they are paid a portion of the customer fee ranging between 45-55% of the fee.\nMarketing.\nThe marketing promotional activities for our current market and year are similar to previous years, including year-round special promotional discounts to improve sales revenue in attracting more potential walk-in and regular customers and to compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty and service-oriented marketing, with a competitive pricing, offering various special promotions year-round in our competitive environment.\nOur Growth Strategy.\nOther than the potential of expanding to the overseas market in China, if and when possible, we have no current plans to open additional wellness centers. Also, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Consumer Price Index (the CPI) in Australia increased by approximately 6% during the twelve (12) month period ended June 30, 2023, it was almost same to last year. Prices continued to rise across a range of services, with annual price growth for services the highest since the introduction of the GST over 20 years ago. Contributing to the prices rises are stronger wages growth and increased costs for utilities and rents, while insurance premiums rose across house, house contents and motor vehicle insurance.\nGlobal massage services project that the market for wellness services like those we provide are on the rise, and medical spas have and are expected to register increased growth in the coming years. We believe that the Chinese market is the most promising area driven by a hectic lifestyle in urban areas. Rising demand from emerging markets is expected to propel the demand for spa treatments in the future with increased focus on personal health.\nAs outlined above, we have identified future partners from strategic cities in China to help us exploit the Chinese market in the major cities of China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai for fiscal 2023, who would be compensated under the above referenced Company Representative Agreement that is Exhibit 99.1 of this Annual Report, in Part IV, Item 15, if and when we are able to expand our wellness services to China, as to which no assurance can be given. According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the consumer price index (CPI) in China rose approximately 2.4% during the twelve (12) month period ended June 30, 2023 which the urban and rural shown growth rate approximately as 0%. These were much lower than those experienced in Australia.\nSeasonality.\nThere is no discernible seasonality in our business, although we expect that the first calendar year quarter is typically our lowest as a percentage of total annual gross revenue. Revenue and operating income will vary by quarter and are hard to predict from quarter to quarter. In addition, the volatility in the local economy will impact our quarterly revenue and operating income.\nSources and Availability of Raw Materials\nOur equipment needs are minimal, consisting of massage benches and various office equipment and computers. We purchase our equipment from local suppliers on an as needed basis and presently do not believe the loss of any one supplier will have an adverse effect on our business, so long as our needs are not adversely affected by the current issues being experienced in world-wide supply chain. See Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe enumeration of risk factors about us, our business operations, our management, consolidated financial statements and our common stock, among other issues that may disclose risks of investments in our common stock is not required of smaller reporting companies like us in our annual or quarterly reports filed with the SEC; however, we believe the following risk factors may be of value to our shareholders or potential investors in our Company. These risk factors should be considered in light of the caption Forward-Looking Statements at the forepart of this Annual Report. We reserve the right not to provide risk factors in our future filings, unless required to do so. We view the following as our primary risk factors, which should not be considered to be all inclusive:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a small company that owns and operates one (1) wellness center in Victoria, Australia, that has had limited, if any, growth during the fiscal years presented in this Annual Report.\nWe acquired our wellness center as part of our acquisition of Sanyi Group, our wholly-owned subsidiary, in 2012, and with our limited growth over these periods, it is difficult to evaluate our future prospects. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, we had gross revenues of US$343,479, with respective net loss of US$53,666 during this fiscal years. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered by a small operating company trying to expand its business enterprise and the highly competitive environment in which we operate; our business strategy may be unsuccessful; and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost-effective manner, if at all. If we are unable to successfully accomplish these tasks, our business will be harmed, and we may fail. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the business of the Company will continue or grow in the future.\nIn conducting our business, we face many risks that may interfere with our business objectives. Some of these risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, we are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, political, industry, business and financial conditions. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business operations.\nYou should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report before you decide to invest in our Company. If any of the risks referred to below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer. In any such case, the trading price of our shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nOur Auditors Report on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, which is contained in this Annual Report, has been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern by reason of our losses, net current liabilities and our negative stockholders deficit, and there is no assurance that we will not continue to experience losses in our business. As a result, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe incurred net losses of US$53,666 during the year ended June 30 2023. We had net current liabilities at June 30, 2023 of US$76,323, and we had at June 30, 2023 a negative net stockholders deficit of US$45,092. These events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exist that may cast significant doubt on our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in view of the Company being able to obtain continued financial support from its sole director, CEO and CFO or its ability to obtain external financing, as to which no assurance can be given.\nThe validity of the going concern basis on which the consolidated financial statements have been prepared depends on our ability to operate as a going concern and assumptions are premised on future events, the outcome of which are inherently uncertain. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1.3 of our consolidated financial statements, though our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe had material weaknesses in our internal controls in financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, and such material weaknesses could adversely affect our ability to report our results of operations and financial condition accurately and in a timely manner.\nOur management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2023. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe specific material weaknesses we identified in our internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023, related to:\n\u00b7 lack of sufficient accounting personnel qualified in US GAAP and SEC reporting; and\nAlthough we have provided additional training to our accounting personnel relating to US GAAP and SEC reporting requirements to partially address the foregoing material weaknesses, we do not believe such weaknesses have been remediated, and we can provide no assurance that they will be remediated in a timely manner.\nAny failure to maintain effective internal controls could adversely impact our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis. If our financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statements are not filed on a timely basis as required by the SEC, we could face severe consequences from those authorities.\nOur industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase market share.\nOur industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. We provide our services in local markets and compete with companies providing similar services. The barriers to entry in this industry are limited, which makes it easy for competitors to open new shops near our current location or any future locations. Many of our competitors have greater marketing, financial and other resources than us that, among other things, could enable them to attempt to maintain or increase their market share by reducing prices or utilizing other strategies. In order to be competitive, we may have to similarly reduce our prices or modify our plan of operations, which in turn may affect our results of operations.\nWe will need additional financing in order to grow our business, and there in no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining the required resources to expand our business or that any potential expansion will result in profitable operations.\nWe do not have significant assets with which to expand our business. To the extent we intend to expand our business in the future through the opening of additional locations, substantial additional capital will be required. These capital expenditures are intended to be funded from third party sources, including the incurring of debt and/or the sale of additional equity securities. In addition to requiring additional financing to fund expansion, we may require additional financing to fund working capital and operating losses in the future should the need arise. The incurrence of debt creates additional financial leverage, and therefore, an increase in the financial risk to our business operations. The sale of additional equity securities will be dilutive to the interests of current shareholders. In addition, there can be no assurance that such additional financing, whether debt or equity, will be available to us or that it will be available on commercially acceptable terms. Any inability to secure such additional financing on appropriate terms could have a materially adverse impact on any plans for expansion, and our business, financial condition and operating results. Factors affecting the availability and price of capital may include the following:\n\u00b7 the availability and cost of capital generally;\n\u00b7 our financial results;\n\u00b7 the experience and reputation of our management team;\n\u00b7 market interest, or lack of interest, in our business industry and our business plan;\n\u00b7 the trading volume of, and volatility in, the market for our common stock, assuming there is a trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7 our ongoing success, or failure, in executing our business plan;\n\u00b7 the amount of our capital needs; and\n\u00b7 the amount of our debt, options, warrants and convertible securities that may be outstanding in our Company at any time and our authorized capital stock.\nOur business will be subject to compliance with current and future government regulation that may increase the anticipated cost of any potential expansion program.\nCurrently, there are no governmental regulations that materially restrict the wellness business in Australia. We are subject to the laws of Victoria, Australia, as administered by Victorias Business Licensing Authority (BLA) as we carry out our business. We may be required to obtain additional work permits in the event that we do not have enough local personnel for any operations in which we engage, and to negotiate with shopping malls or others prospective lessors on lease or rental terms, recruitment and training, shop fittings and refurbishment to comply with rules and regulations of any shopping mall or other lessors, including but not limited to operational hours, signage, promotions and cleanliness.\nThere is a risk that new regulations could increase our costs of doing business and prevent us from carrying out any expansion or franchising program we may undertake. We may also have to sustain the cost of renovation or improvement on any outlet once every five (5) years as is customarily required by shopping malls. If renovation costs exceed our cash reserves, we may be unable to complete any expansion program and have to abandon the related outlet(s).\nOur shareholders and prospective investors ownership in the Company may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, we may issue additional authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders or potential investors. We expect to need to issue a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, raising additional capital in the future to fund our operations and other business purposes.\nOur fees are based on numerous factors outside of our control.\nNumerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of our services and our fee structure. These factors include the local and regional economies, the competition, shortage of human resources, government regulations, supply chain issues and the current inflation in many economies related to our supply chain. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of any these factors may result in our failure to achieve an adequate return on invested capital and our business may fail, thereby resulting in the loss of any shareholders entire investment in our Company.\nCompliance with the reporting requirements of federal securities laws can be expensive.\nWe are a public reporting company in the United States, and accordingly, subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and other federal securities laws, rules and regulations, including compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs of preparing and filing annual and quarterly reports and other information with the SEC and furnishing audited and reviewed financial statements in reports filed with the SEC, along with required communications with our shareholders, are substantial. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs associated with continuing as a public company, including, but not limited to, legal, accounting, filing and other related costs and expenses. Failure to comply with applicable securities laws, rules and regulations could result in private or governmental legal action against us or our officers and directors, which could have a detrimental impact on our business and financial condition, the value of our common stock or other equity securities we may issue and the ability of our shareholders to resell these securities.\nThe Covid-19 pandemic presents ongoing risks to our business.\nIn response to the Covid-19 pandemic, governments and other authorities around the world have implemented significant measures intended to control the spread of the virus. While many of these restrictions have been lifted as the rates of Covid-19 infection have decreased or stabilized and as various vaccines have become more widely available, a resurgence of Covid-19 and the impact of variants of the virus that causes Covid-19 may result in the reinstatement of social distancing measures; business closures; lockdowns; restrictions on operations; and quarantines and travel bans. In addition, any governmental mandates that require Covid-19 vaccination or other employee behaviors may result in employee attrition at the Company or its suppliers or customers and may create difficulties in satisfying future employment and supply requirements.\nRising inflation may negatively affect our operating results.\nSince 2021, global economic conditions have deteriorated, with significantly increased inflation and the risks of further inflation and recession in 2023 and beyond. These unfavorable economic conditions may lead to decreased demand for our services, less disposable income of our customers and higher prices for our customers. To the extent that we are unable to increase the prices of our services in response to increased costs resulting from inflation, our operating margins will be compressed.\nSupply chain disruptions could adversely affect our business.\nSupply chain dislocations resulting from global geopolitical and public health issues such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Covid-19 pandemic and other causes may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Such disruptions may increase our costs of doing business, including through significant increases in the price the products and equipment required for our business operations and the related costs of shipment. Supply chain disruptions may also adversely affect our access to suppliers, manufacturers, customers and vendors and may impair our ability to perform wellness services. Delays in our ability to meet our obligations as a result of supply chain issues may negatively affect our reputation, our relationships with customers and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is no active trading market for our shares of common stock.\nSmall trading volumes are generally understood to depress market prices. As a result, you may not always be able to resell shares of our common stock publicly at the time and prices that you feel are fair or appropriate, even if we are successful in obtaining public quotations of our common stock on a qualified quotation medium.\nIf an active market for our common stock develops, there is a significant risk that the Companys common stock price may fluctuate dramatically in the future in response to any of the following factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7 variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 announcements that our revenue or income are below analysts expectations;\n\u00b7 general economic slowdowns; and\n\u00b7 sales of large blocks of our common stock by insiders and others.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nAll future revenues are anticipated to be utilized in the furtherance of our business plan, and accordingly, it is highly unlikely that you will receive any dividends from us in the near future, if ever.\nOur common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC, which may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9, which established the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, and the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person and make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and that the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination, and that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of the Companys common stock if and when such shares are eligible for sale and may cause a decline in the market value of its stock.\nBecause of increased regulatory efforts of governmental and quasi-governmental agencies regarding the trading of securities that are deemed to be penny stocks, the cost and expense of depositing and inducing a broker-dealer to effect sales of these shares is very costly, which can be in excess of value of the shares sought to be sold, and often includes requirements of legal opinions of both the selling shareholders counsel and the broker-dealers counsel, both at the expense of the selling shareholder.\nCurrently, broker-dealers require legal opinions of shareholders of almost all over-the-counter stocks to deposit and sell these shares, and all of these legal opinions are required to be paid for by the shareholder; and often, two (2) legal opinions are required, one (1) from the shareholders legal counsel and one (1) from the broker-dealers legal counsel. This policy has been required of mostly all low-priced over-the-counter shares, regardless of whether the shares have been registered with the SEC, or whether there is no legend on the stock certificate representing the shares and always if the shares are designated as restricted securities. Larger, national broker-dealers will generally not even trade these securities. The high cost of these types of legal opinions is often more than the value of the shares sought to be sold, and the process can take two (2) to three (3) weeks or more. Accordingly, shareholders with limited shares of low-priced stocks will be unable to economically sell their shares, regardless of whether an established trading market for the shares exists, and if they could sell their shares, the required selling process will inhibit their ability to sell the shares when they desire to sell their shares.\nOur sole director and executive officer, Mr. Xin Jin, and our former President, Mr. Thomas Tang, and Mr. Yew Nic Kien Cheon, a business consultant to the Company, own a significant percentage of our capital stock, and they may be in a position to control decisions of the Company that our other shareholders do not consider to be in their best interests.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, the foregoing persons beneficially own in the aggregate approximately 26.87% of our issued and outstanding shares of common voting stock. See the caption Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management in Part III, Item 12 hereof. As a result, they may have the ability to substantially control elections to our board of directors, the outcome of issues requiring approval by our shareholders and other corporate actions. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our Company that may be favored by other shareholders; and could prevent transactions in which shareholders might otherwise recover a premium for their shares over current market prices. This concentration of ownership and influence in management and board decision making could also harm the price of our capital stock by, among other things, discouraging a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire shares of our capital stock, whether by making a tender offer or attempting to obtain control of our Company.\nWe have established a Series of 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. The Series A Preferred Stock shares has superiority voting rights equal to 1,000 votes per share. In the event that such votes do not total 51% of all votes, than regardless of the provisions of this Series, in any such case, the votes cast by Series A Preferred stock shall be equal to 51% of all votes cast at any meeting of shareholders, or any issue put to the shareholders for voting, and the Company may state that any such action was had by majority vote of all shareholders. Furthermore, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock have the right to the majority of the directors to the Board of the Company and to further amend the Certificate of Incorporation to ensure the furtherance of the Company and its operations as such holders determine. Management could issue one (1) share of this Series to control the approval on these and other matters affecting the Company and its shareholders without any vote of the shareholders. See Exhibit 4 in Part IV, Item 15, for a description of the Companys securities and this Series.\nYou may experience difficulties in effecting service of legal process, enforcing foreign judgments or bringing original actions in Australia based on United States or other foreign laws against us, our management or any experts named in this Annual Report.\nWe conduct substantially all of our operations in Australia and substantially all of our assets are located in Australia. In addition, all of our senior executive officers reside within Australia. As a result, it may not be possible to affect service of process within the United States or elsewhere outside Australia upon our senior executive officers, including with respect to matters arising under U.S. federal securities laws or applicable state securities laws.\nAustralia does not have treaties with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of court judgments, it is uncertain with regard to whether courts of Australia would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts against us or our directors or officers pursuant to civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States; or exercise jurisdiction over actions brought against us or our directors or officers pursuant to the securities laws of the United States or any state in the United States. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur corporate offices are located at 271 Blackburn Road, Mount Waverley, Victoria, Australia 3149; and our telephone number is (61) 393955324. These premises are owned by Mr. Xin Jin, our sole director CEO and CFO. We occupy the space on a month-to-month basis, rent free. The office space consists of approximately one hundred (100) square meters.\nAs of June 30, 2023, and currently, we have one (1) Company wholly-owned and operating wellness center. Relevant information with respect to this location is as follows:\nLocation Size of Premises (Sq. Meters) Lease Term Commencement Date Annual Rent\nPoint Cook Outlet Seventy-seven (77) Seven (7) years Renewable for an additional five (5) years 8/21/2019 $55,996 ITEM 3.

ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNone; not applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink Tier of the OTC Markets under the symbol ARPC.\nFor any market that may develop for our common stock, the sale of shares of our common stock comprised of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 of the SEC, any other available exemption from registration under the Securities Act or by registration under the Securities Act by members of management or others, including any person to whom any such securities may be issued in the future, may have a substantial adverse impact on any such public market. For general information regarding the requirements of resales of restricted securities under Rule 144, see the heading Rule 144 of this Item below. Presently, and based upon advice of our legal counsel, we believe Rule 144 will become available for the resale of our shares of common stock by our shareholders so long as we become and remain current in our required reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, regardless of whether we were a former shell company. We have not been a shell company since the filing and subsequent effectiveness of our S-1 Registration Statement on April 15, 2016. The Prospectus of our S-1 Registration Statement contained the Form 10 Information required by subparagraph (i) of Rule 144 for the availability of Rule 144 for former shell companies, and such subparagraph indicates that the issuer may provide the Form 10 Information in any filing of the issuer with the Commission. The availability of Rule 144 and Section 4(a)(1) of the Securities Act for the resale of our shares of common stock by our shareholders will be reviewed the Company on a case by case basis at the time of the intended sale and before any sale thereof.\nWith 373,950,544 outstanding shares of our common stock as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, the sale of any number of these outstanding shares could have an adverse effect on any market that may develop in the future for our shares of common stock. 273,460,844 of our shares of common stock are held by non-affiliates who have held their respective shares for in excess of two (2) years, and all of these shares could be considered to be a part of the public float of our shares; approximately 2,750,340 of these shares are held in street name at broker-dealers or in the Depository Trust Company (DTC).\nRule 144\nThe following is a summary of the current requirements of Rule 144, excluding issues related to companies that are or have ever been a shell company:\nSecurities\nAffiliate or Person Selling on Behalf of an Affiliate\nNon-Affiliate (and has not been an Affiliate During the Prior Three Months)\nRestricted Securities of Reporting Issuers\nDuring six-month holding period - no resales under Rule 144 Permitted.\nAfter six-month holding period - may resell in accordance with all Rule 144 requirements including:\nCurrent public information,\nVolume limitations,\nManner of sale requirements for equity securities, and\nFiling of Form 144.\nDuring six-month holding period - no resales under Rule 144 permitted.\nAfter six-month holding period but before one year - unlimited public resales under Rule 144 except that the current public information requirement still applies.\nAfter one-year holding period - unlimited public resales under Rule 144; need not comply with any other Rule 144 requirements.\nRestricted Securities of Non-Reporting Issuers\nDuring one-year holding period - no resales under Rule 144 permitted.\nAfter one-year holding period - may resell in accordance with all Rule 144 requirements including:\nCurrent public information,\nVolume limitations,\nManner of sale requirements for equity securities, and\nFiling of Form 144.\nDuring one-year holding period - no resales under Rule 144 permitted.\nAfter one-year holding period - unlimited public resales under Rule 144; need not comply with any other Rule 144 requirements.\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated during the fiscal years, the high and low closing bid quotations, as reported by the OTC Markets, and represents prices between broker-dealers and does not include retail markups, markdowns or commissions, and may not represent actual transactions:\nFor the Years Ended June 30,\nHigh\nLow\nFirst Quarter\n0.0208\n0.0208\nSecond Quarter\n0.0300\n0.0113\nThird Quarter\n0.0225\n0.0011\nFourth Quarter\n0.0225\n0.0011\nWe currently have approximately 1,540 shareholders of record as of October 5, 2023, not including an indeterminate number of shareholders who may hold their shares in street name at broker-dealers or in the DTC.

The payment of dividends, if any, is within the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the Companys earnings, if any, its capital requirements and financial condition and such other factors as the Board of Directors may consider.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023\nNone.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nNone.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2021\nNone.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2020\n17,537,000 shares of our common stock were issued in one (1) tranche to thirty (30) persons for consulting services provided to us and valued at par value or $0.000001 per share on October 9, 2019; and an aggregate total of 21,861,309 shares of our common stock were issued in a separate tranche to approximately two-hundred and forty-one (241) persons located in various cities in China on January 20, 2020, pursuant to our Company Representative Agreement.

Such factors are discussed further below under Trends and Uncertainties, and also include general economic factors and conditions that may directly or indirectly impact our financial condition or results of operations. See the caption Forward-Looking Statements at the forepart of this Annual Report.\nOverview of Current and Planned Business Operations\nThrough Sanyi Group, we are engaged in providing wellness services that include acupressure/reflexology, massage therapy and cupping. We offer various types of massage therapy, such as Swedish, deep tissue and hot stone oil, among others, all as discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, above. We primarily rely on our promotional activities and our shopping center location in attracting new customers and maintaining our current customers.\nWe have identified future partners from strategic cities in China to help us exploit and expand to the Chinese market for our wellness services in the major cities of China, including Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Fujian, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai for fiscal 2023, though these plans are subject to the uncertainties related to the Covid-19 pandemic and other factors, including but not limited to obtaining the required funding for expand.\nJune, 30,\nJune, 30,\nUS$ US$\nRevenue 343,479 262,537\nOperating expenses:\nPayroll and employee related expense (104,317 ) (94,196 )\nAmortization on right-of-use assets (60,199 ) (64,884 )\nFinance cost (8,580 ) (11,378 )\nGeneral and administrative expenses (202,564 ) (110,253 )\nTotal Operating expenses (375,660 ) (280,711 )\nLoss from operations (32,181 ) (18,174 )\nOther income - 60,206\nInterest income\n(Loss)/income from continuing operations before income tax expenses (32,064 ) 42,111\nIncome tax expense (21,602 ) -\nNet (loss)/income after income tax expense for the year (53,666 ) 42,111\nExchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations (1,878 ) (3,765 )\nTotal comprehensive (loss)/income for the year (55,544 ) 38,346\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2023, to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2022\nRevenue\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, we had $343,479 in revenue compared to $262,537 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which is an increase of $80,942, approximately 1,350 customers from the previous year. The revenue increase is mainly due to the Australian Government Authority starting to allow occasional people movement and the removal of border restriction. The opening of our business operation and the cessation of the lockdown supported a higher revenue.\nPayroll and employee related expense\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, our payroll and employee related expense increased by US$10,121 to US$104,317 as compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, of US$94,196. As employees are employed on an hourly basis, the cessation of the lockdown led to staff having longer working hour, approximately 450 hours compared to last year.\nAmortization on right-of-use asset\nAmortization charges was US$60,199 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, as compared to fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, of US$64,884, a decrease of US$4,685, arising from foreign exchange translation.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, general and administrative expense increased by US$92,311 to US$202,564, compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, of US$110,253. The increase in expense resulted from high professional fees paid to lawyer, auditor and consultant amounting to US$93,850 for the compliance report.\nNet Income/(loss) after tax\nEven though our revenue has slowly recovered from the pandemic, our net income still decreased by US$95,777, mainly due to the high compliance cost of US$93,850 been paid and the subsidized arises due to Covid-19.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt June 30, 2023, we had a net current liabilities of US$76,323 (June 30, 2022 net current liabilities of US$17,497) and accumulated losses of US$193,286 (June 30, 2022 accumulated losses US$139,620), and of that date, the Group shown capital deficiency of US$45,092 (June 30, 2022 total equity of US$10,452). We reported an after-tax loss of US$53,666 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023 (June 30, 2022 after tax income of US$42,111). The net tangible asset mainly due to high professional fee paid to lawyer, auditor and consultant amounting to US$93,850 for the compliance report.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in U.S. dollars. The Companys fiscal year end is June 30.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods discussed. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is its local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, stockholders equity is translated at the historical rates and the consolidated statement of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity. A component of accumulated other comprehensive income will be released into income when the Company executes a partial or complete sale of an investment in a foreign subsidiary or a group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business and/or when the Company no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a foreign subsidiary or group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses that are reflected in results of operations as unrealized (based on period end translation) and realized (upon settlement of the transactions) and reported under other general expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.\nFair Value of Financial Instrument\nThe Companys financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held in several Australian bank accounts and time deposit accounts. We regularly assess the level of credit risk we are exposed to and whether there are better ways of managing credit risk. We invest our cash and cash equivalents with reputable financial institutions. The Company has not incurred any losses related to these deposits.\nIncome Taxes\nPotential benefits of income tax losses are not recognized in the accounts until realization is more likely than not. The Company has adopted ASC 740-10-50 Accounting for Income Taxes as of its inception. Pursuant to the standard, the Company is required to compute tax asset benefits for initial years of operating losses carried forward.\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-4-5, Earnings per Share. The standard requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the periods discussed. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the periods discussed, including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nRecent accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and issued subsequent amendments within ASU 2021-01 and ASU 2022-06 (collectively, including ASU 2020-04, ASC 848) in January 2021 and December 2022 respectively. ASC 848 provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP on contract modifications and hedge accounting to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. These optional expedients and exceptions provided in ASC 848 are effective for us from January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2024. We have elected the optional expedients for certain existing interest rate swaps that are designated as cash flow hedges, which did not have a material impact on the financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are evaluating the effects, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which provides guidance on the acquirers accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination. The amendments require an acquirer recognizes and measures contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination at the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606 as if it had originated the contracts. This guidance also provides certain practical expedients for acquirers when recognizing and measuring acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for us for the year ending June 30, 2024 and interim reporting periods during the year ending June 30, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effects, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions, which clarifies that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. The amendments also clarify that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. This guidance also requires certain disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The new guidance is required to be applied prospectively with any adjustments from the adoption of the amendments recognized in earnings and disclosed on the date of adoption. This guidance is effective for us for the year ending June 30, 2025 and interim reporting periods during the year ending June 30, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effects, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which require a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose qualitative and quantitative information about the supplier finance program. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. The new guidance is required to be applied retrospectively to each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. This guidance is effective for us for the year ending June 30, 2024 and interim reporting periods during the year ending June 30, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effects, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nItem 305 of SEC Regulation S-K provides that certain registrants are required to categorize market risk sensitive instruments into instruments entered into for trading purposes and instruments entered into for purposes other than trading purposes. Within both the trading and other than trading portfolios, separate quantitative information shall be presented, to the extent material, for each market risk exposure category (i.e., interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk, commodity price risk, and other relevant market risks, such as equity price risk). These requirements are not applicable to smaller reporting companies under subsection (e) thereof. ITEM 8: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAudited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2023 begin on the following page of this Annual Report.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm [PCAOB ID 3487]\nTo the Shareholder and Board of Director\nArem Pacific Corporation\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Arem Pacific Corporation (the Company) and its subsidiaries (the Group) as of June 30, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operation and other comprehensive loss, changes in stockholders (deficit)/equity, and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Group as of June 30, 2023 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nMaterial Uncertainty Related to Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Group will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1.3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Group incurred net losses of US$53,666 during the year ended June 30, 2023. The Group had net current liabilities as of 30 June, 2023 of US$76,323. Besides the Group as of 30 June, 2023 its negative net stockholders deficit of US$45,092. These events or conditions indicate that a material uncertainty exist that may cast significant doubt on the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in view of the Group will be able to obtain continued financial support from its shareholder or its ability to obtain external financing.\nThe validity of the going concern basis on which the consolidated financial statements are prepared depends on the Groups ability to operate as a going concern as set forth above. The assumptions are premised on future events, the outcome of which are inherently uncertain. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1.3. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Groups management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u2018\u2018PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Group is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Groups internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Audit Alliance LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nSingapore\nDate: 13 October 2023\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nNote\nUS$ US$\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents 43,394 116,963\nOther assets 19,988 20,395\nOther receivables 13,685\nTotal current assets\n77,067 137,565\nPlant and equipment, net - -\nRight-of-use asset 182,744 251,466\nTotal non-current asset\n182,744 251,466\nTotal assets\n259,811 389,031\nLiabilities and Stockholders(Deficit)Equity\nLiabilities\nAccrued and other liabilities 80,486 85,025\nBorrowings 9,303 9,625\nLease liability 63,601 60,412\nTotal current liabilities\n153,390 155,062\nLease liability 151,513 223,517\nTotal non-current liability\n151,513 223,517\nTotal liabilities\n304,903 378,579\nStockholders(deficit)/equity\nCommon stock, $0.000001 par value, 500,000,000 shares authorized and 373,950,544 (2022: 373,950,544) shares issued and outstanding, respectively\nAdditional paid in capital\n157,150 157,150\nOther comprehensive loss (9,312 ) (7,434 )\nAccumulated losses\n(193,286 ) (139,620 )\nTotal stockholders (deficit)/equity\n(45,092 ) 10,452\nTotal liabilities and stockholders (deficit)/equity\n259,811 389,031\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed audited consolidated financial statements.\nAREM PACIFC CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nNote\nUS$ US$\nRevenue\n343,479 262,537\nOperating expenses\nPayroll and employee related expense\n104,317 94,196\nAmortization on right-of-use asset\n60,199 64,884\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n202,564 110,253\nTotal operating expenses\n367,080 269,333\n(Loss)/Income from operations\n(23,601 ) 71,204\nInterest expenses\n(8,580 ) (11,378 )\nOther income\n- 60,206\nInterest income\nTotal other (expense)/income\n(8,463 ) 48,907\n(Loss)/Income from continuing operations before income tax expenses\n(32,064 ) 42,111\nIncome tax expense (21,602 ) -\nNet (loss)/income after income tax expense for the year\n(53,666 ) 42,111\nOther comprehensive loss\nExchange differences arising on translation of foreign operations\n(1,878 ) (3,765 )\nOther comprehensive loss\n(1,878 ) (3,765 )\nTotal comprehensive (loss)/income for the year\n(55,544 ) 38,346\nNet (loss)/income per share\nBasic and diluted\n(0.0001485 ) 0.0001025\nWeighted average number of common stock outstanding\nBasic and diluted\n373,950,544 373,950,544\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed audited consolidated financial statements.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY/DEFICIT\nAdditional Other\nCommon Stock Paid in Comprehensive Accumulated Total\nShares Amount Capital Loss Losses (Deficit)/Equity\nBalance as of July 1, 2021\n373,950,544 157,150 (3,669 ) (181,731 ) (27,894 )\nIncome for the year - - - - 42,111 42,111\nOther comprehensive loss - - - (3,765 ) - (3,765 )\nTotal comprehensive (loss)/income for the year - - - (3,765 ) 42,111 38,346\nBalance as of June 30, 2022\n373,950,544 157,150 (7,434 ) (139,620 ) 10,452\nLoss for the year - - - - (53,666 ) (53,666 )\nOther comprehensive loss - - - (1,878 ) - (1,878 )\nTotal comprehensive loss for the year - - - (1,878 ) (53,666 ) (55,544 )\nBalance as of June 30, 2023\n373,950,544 157,150 (9,312 ) (193,286 ) (45,092 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed audited consolidated financial statement.\nCommon Stock\nAdditional Paid-in Capital\nOther Comprehensive Loss\nAccumulated Losses\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nUS$ US$\nCash flows from operating activities:\n(Loss)/Income before tax (32,064 ) 42,111\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities:\nAmortization on right-of-use asset 60,199 64,884\nNet changes in operating assets and liabilities\n(Increase)/Decrease in other receivables (13,071 ) 1,881\nDecrease in accrued and other liabilities (4,861 ) (67,515 )\nCash generated from operating activities 10,203 41,361\nIncome tax paid (21,602 ) -\nPrincipal payment of lease liability (68,815 ) (55,097 )\nNet cash used in operating activities (80,214 ) (13,736 )\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents (80,214 ) (13,736 )\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of year 116,963 140,136\nExchange difference on translation of foreign operations 6,645 (9,437 )\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of year 43,394 116,963\nSupplemental cash flow information\nInterest income received\nSupplemental non-cash flows information\nLease liability arising from obtaining right-of-use asset (8,580 ) (11,378 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed audited consolidated financial statements.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\n1.

The amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements have been rounded to the nearest dollar.\n1.3 Going Concern Basis\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Group will continue its operations in the foreseeable future and that the Group will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of operations. The Group incurred net losses of US$53,666 during the year ended June 30, 2023. The Group had net current liabilities as of June 30, 2023 of US$76,323. Besides the Group as of June 30, 2023 had a negative net stockholders deficit of US$45,092.\nThe Group believes that there are reasonable grounds to support the fact that it will be able to pay its debts as and when they become due and payable. In forming this opinion, the Group has considered the following factors:\n(i) As at June 30, 2023, US$9,303 of the borrowings was owed to Xin Jin, a significant shareholder and an officer of the Company and the sole Director of the Company.\n(ii) The Company has received a Letter of Support from Xin Jin, in which he offers to provide continuing financial support to Sanyi Group to enable it to meet its liabilities as and when they become due and payable for a period of not less than twelve (12) months from the date of the financial statements. The loan of $9,303 as of June 30, 2023, to Sanyi Group, will not be called upon without giving at least thirteen (13) months notice.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\nIf the Group is unable to continue as a going concern, it may be required to realize its assets and extinguish its liabilities other than in the ordinary course of business at amounts different from those stated in the consolidated financial statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or to the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Group not continue as a going concern.\n1.4 Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n1.5 Foreign Currency Translation\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiary is its local currency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates, stockholders equity is translated at the historical rates and the consolidated statement of operations and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders equity. A component of accumulated other comprehensive income will be released into income when the Group executes a partial or complete sale of an investment in a foreign subsidiary or a group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business and/or when the Group no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a foreign subsidiary or group of assets of a foreign subsidiary considered a business.\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency are recorded based on exchange rates at the time such transactions arise. Subsequent changes in exchange rates result in foreign currency transaction gains and losses that are reflected in results of operations as unrealized (based on period end translation) and realized (upon settlement of the transactions) and reported under other general expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and other comprehensive income.\n1.6 Cash and Cash Equivalents and Concentration of Credit Risk\nThe Group considers all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nThe Group's financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are held in several Australian bank accounts and time deposit accounts. The Group regularly assesses the level of credit risk we are exposed to and whether there are better ways of managing credit risk. The Group invests its cash and cash equivalents with reputable financial institutions. The Group has not incurred any losses related to these deposits.\n1.7 Other Receivables\nOther receivables represent amounts that the Company has paid in advance of receiving benefits or services. Other receivables include tax recoverable from Australian Taxation Office and prepayment. Prepayment is recognized as an expense over the general contractual period.\n1.8 Plant and Equipment\nPlant and equipment are recorded at cost. Costs of renewal and improvements that substantially extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as below:\nFurniture and fittings 5 years\nOffice equipment 10 years\nComputers 2 years\nMotor vehicles 5 years\nPlant and equipment 3 years\nLease improvements 3 years\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\nDerecognition\nAn item of plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no further economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.\n1.9 Leases\nThe Company assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nAs lessee\nThe Company applies a single recognition and measurement approach for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low-value assets. The Company recognizes lease liabilities representing the obligations to make lease payments and right-of-use assets representing the right to use the underlying leased assets.\nRight-of-use asset\nThe Company recognizes right-of-use asset at the commencement date of the lease (i.e. the date the underlying asset is available for use). Right-of-use asset are measured at cost, less any accumulated amortization and impairment losses, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liability. The cost of right-of-use asset includes the amount of lease liability recognized, initial direct costs incurred, and lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received. Right-of-use asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.\nIf ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost reflects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. The right-of-use assets are also subject to impairment. The accounting policy for impairment is disclosed in key judgement.\nLease liability\nAt the commencement date of the lease, the Company recognizes lease liability measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease term. The lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised by the Company and payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising the option to terminate. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognized as expenses (unless they are incurred to produce inventories) in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs.\nIn calculating the present value of lease payments, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date because the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased to reflect the accretion of interest and reduced for the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e.g. changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset.\n1.10 Payables\nOther payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Otherwise they are presented as non-current liabilities.\nOther payable are initially recognized at fair value and subsequently carried at amortized cost using the effective interest method.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\n1.11 Provisions\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, as a result of past events, for which it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will result and that outflow can be reliably measured. Provisions are measured using the best estimate of the amounts required to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period.\n1.12 Loans and Borrowings\nAll loans and borrowings are initially recognized at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any discount or premium on settlement.\nThe Groups current liabilities include a loan from a significant shareholder which is not interest bearing. The shareholder has provided a letter of support to Sanyi Group, which states that the loan to the Group will not be recalled without giving at least thirteen (13) months notice. This loan is not evidenced by a promissory note.\nLoans are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve (12) months after the reporting date.\n1.13 Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable after taking into account any discounts.\nThe Group derives revenue primarily through the provision of therapeutic health services from its Oriental holistic health centers. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers, the pricing is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured. This is generally based on the completion of services provided to the customers at the Oriental holistic health centers and settlement of the transactions either by cash or credit card payments.\nInterest revenue is recognized using the effective interest method, which for floating rate financial assets is the rate inherent in the instrument. Dividend revenue is recognized when the right to receive a dividend has been established.\nAll revenue is stated net of the amount of goods and services tax.\n1.14 Income Tax\nTaxes payable is based on taxable profit for the period which excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods. Taxable profit also excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted as of the balance sheet date.\nDeferred income tax expense is calculated using the liability method in accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current in the balance sheet and are measured based on the difference between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and their tax basis when such differences are considered temporary in nature. Temporary differences related to intercompany profits are deferred using the buyers tax rate. Deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability every balance sheet date, and the amount probable of recovery is recognized.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\n1.14 Income Tax (Continued)\nDeferred income tax expense represents the change in deferred tax asset and liability balances during the periods discussed except for the deferred tax related to items recognized in other comprehensive income or resulting from a business combination or disposal. Changes resulting from amendments and revisions in tax laws and tax rates are recognized when the new tax laws or rates become effective or are substantively enacted. Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on managements expectations.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities, when they related to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, and when the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.\nDeferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when the timing of the reversal of this temporary difference is controlled by Group and is not expected to happen in the foreseeable future. This is applicable for the majority of Groups subsidiaries.\n1.15 Goods and Services Tax (GST)\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognized net of the amount of GST, except where the amount of GST incurred is not recoverable from the Australian Taxation Office (ATO).\nReceivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the ATO is included with other receivables or payables in the statement of financial position.\nCash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities, which are recoverable from or payable to the ATO, are presented as operating cash flows included in receipts from customers or payments to suppliers.\n1.16 Earnings (Loss) per Common Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income or losses available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed similar to basic net income or losses per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been issued and of the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible preferred shares. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the periods discussed. Under if-converted method, convertible outstanding instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later).\n1.17 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nComprehensive income (loss) is presented net of applicable income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders' equity and comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses that under GAAP are reported as separate components of stockholders' equity instead of net income (loss).\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\n2. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements\nThe sole Director evaluates estimates and judgements incorporated into the consolidated financial statements based on historical knowledge and best available current information. Estimates assume a reasonable expectation of future events and are based on current trends and economic data, obtained both externally and within the Group.\nKey Estimates\n(i) Useful lives\nThe Group determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation and amortization charges for its plant and equipment. The useful lives could change significantly as a result of technical innovations or some other event. The depreciation and amortization charge will increase where the useful lives are less than previously estimated lives, or technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold will be written off or written down.\n(ii) Income tax\nThe Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the Group's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\n(iii) Fair value measure of shares issued\nThe calculation of the fair value of shares issued requires significant estimate to be made in regard to several variables. The estimations made are subject to variability that may alter the overall fair value determined.\nKey Judgements\n(i) Provision for impairment of receivables\nThe provision for impairment of receivables assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. The level of provision is assessed by taking into account the recent sales experience, the ageing of receivables, historical collection rates and specific knowledge of the individual debtors financial position.\n(ii) Impairment\nThe Group assessed that no indicators of impairment existed at the reporting date and as such no impairment testing was performed.\n3. Segment Information\nThe consolidated entity operates predominantly in one industry and one geographical segment, those being Oriental holistic health services and Australia, respectively.\nAREM PACIFIC CORPORATION\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2023\n4.

ITEM 9: CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that material information relating to us is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness, as of June 30, 2023, of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2023.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal controls over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records, which in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of our assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the issuer; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related rules as promulgated by the SEC, our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting as of June 30, 2023, using criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2023 due to the following material weaknesses:\n\u00b7 lack of sufficient accounting personnel qualified in US GAAP and SEC reporting; and\n\u00b7 insufficient accounting staff, which results in a failure to segregate duties sufficiently to ensure a timely and proper preparation and review of the financial statements.\nWe plan to take steps to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as soon as practicable by:\n\u00b7 hiring additional internal staff familiar with US GAAP and SEC reporting. In the past couple of years, we have made offers to hire accounting personnel familiar with US GAAP and SEC reporting experience but has as of yet been unable to hire a suitable candidate. We now plan to hire a professional recruitment agency to assist us in the identification and selection of appropriate candidates.\n\u00b7 Enhance staff awareness of laws and regulations by conducting more trainings.\n\u00b7 hiring sufficient staff to adequately segregate responsibilities and insure timely preparation of financial statements; and providing training to our accounting personnel on US GAAP, SEC reporting and other regulatory requirements regarding the preparation of financial statements. Our financial personnel attended US GAAP and SEC reporting training sessions organized by an international accounting firm. We plan to hold similar US GAAP and SEC reporting training on a regular basis.\nAlthough we increased the training provided to accounting personnel relating to US GAAP and SEC reporting to partially address the foregoing material weaknesses, we do not believe such weaknesses have been remediated and we can provide no assurance that they will be remediated in a timely manner.\nWe believe that we are taking the steps necessary for remediation of the material weaknesses identified above, and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of these steps and to make any changes that our management deems appropriate.\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report is not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to satisfy these requirements by providing the managements report only.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWith the exception of commencing the process of implementing the foregoing steps to resolve the weaknesses in our internal controls, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. Further, the design of the control system must reflect that there are resource constraints and that the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

Except as otherwise indicated, all shares of our common stock are beneficially owned, and sole investment and voting power is held by the person named. For purposes of this table, a person or group of persons is deemed to have beneficial ownership of any shares of common stock, which such person has the right to acquire within sixty (60) days after the date hereof.

The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the directors are not, and have not been for at least three (3) years, one (1) of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of their family members have engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, our board of directors has not made a subjective determination as to our director that no relationship exists which, in the opinion of our board of directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had our board of directors made these determinations, our board of directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by our director and us with regard to our directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to us and our management.
