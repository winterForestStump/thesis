MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket for Common Equity\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Market Pink Sheet (OTC PINK) under the symbol RAYT. The following table sets forth the high and low bid prices for our common stock for the two most recently completed fiscal years. Such prices are based on inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, markdown or commission, and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nFiscal 2019 Low High\nFirst Quarter $ 0.29 $ 0.34\nSecond Quarter $ 0.23 $ 0.75\nThird Quarter $ 0.20 $ 0.51\nFourth Quarter $ 0.33 $ 0.50\nFiscal 2020 Low High\nFirst Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.50\nSecond Quarter $ 0.09 $ 0.51\nThird Quarter $ 0.05 $ 0.50\nFourth Quarter $ 0.07 $ 0.07\nFiscal 2021 Low High\nFirst Quarter $ 0.07 $ 1.45\nSecond Quarter $ 1.13 $ 2.65\nThird Quarter $ 1.50 $ 3.02\nFiscal 2022 Low High\nFirst Quarter $ 0.24 $ 2.98\nSecond Quarter $ 2.5 $ 2.74\nThird Quarter $ 0.44 $ 2.5\nFourth Quarter $ 0.8 $ 1.95\nPenny Stock Considerations\nThe trading of our common stock is deemed to be penny stock as that term is generally defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to mean equity securities with a price of less than $5.00. Our shares thus are subject to rules that impose sales practice and disclosure requirements on broker-dealers who engage in certain transactions involving a penny stock.\nUnder the penny stock regulations, a broker-dealer selling a penny stock to anyone other than an established customer or accredited investor must make a special suitability determination regarding the purchaser and must receive the purchasers written consent to the transaction prior to the sale, unless the broker-dealer is otherwise exempt. Generally, an individual with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $100,000 individually or $300,000 together with his or her spouse is considered an accredited investor. In addition, under the penny stock regulations the broker-dealer is required to:\n\u25cf Deliver, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prepared by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, unless the broker-dealer or the transaction is otherwise exempt;\n\u25cf Disclose commissions payable to the broker-dealer and our registered representatives and current bid and offer quotations for the securities;\n\u25cf Send monthly statements disclosing recent price information pertaining to the penny stock held in a customers account, the accounts value and information regarding the limited market in penny stocks; and\n\u25cf Make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction, prior to conducting any penny stock transaction in the customers account.\nBecause of these regulations, broker-dealers may encounter difficulties in their attempt to buy or sell shares of our common stock, which may affect the ability of selling stockholders or other holders to sell their shares in the secondary market and have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market. These additional sales practice and disclosure requirements could impede the sale of our common stock in the market place. In addition, the liquidity for our common stock may be decreased, with a corresponding decrease in the price of our common stock. Our shares are likely to be subject to such penny stock rules for the foreseeable future.\nCommon Stock Currently Outstanding\nAs of December 28, 2022, 50,163,797 shares were issued and outstanding.\nHolders\nAs of the date of this Report, we had approximately 587 stockholders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nWe have not declared any cash dividends on our common stock since our inception and do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. We plan to retain future earnings, if any, for use in our business. Any decisions as to future payments of dividends will depend on our earnings and financial position and such other facts, as the Board of Directors deems relevant.\nReports to Stockholders\nWe are currently subject to the information and reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will continue to file periodic reports, and other information with the SEC. We intend to send annual reports to our stockholders containing audited financial statements.\nTransfer Agent\nPacific Stock Transfer Company located at 6725 Via Austi Pkwy., Suite 300, Las Vegas, NV 89119 is the transfer agent for our common stock.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, the Company sold 49,114 shares of common stock to 2 independent investors pursuant to a private placement; 16,614 shares at $2.21; 32,500 shares at $2.20 for a total amount of $108,217.\nThe Company relied upon Section 4(2) and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the sale of these securities.

There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary amounts of additional capital or that our estimates of our capital requirements will prove to be accurate. As of the date of this Form 10-K, we did not have any commitments from any source to provide such additional capital. Even if we are able to secure outside financing, it may not be available in the amounts or the times when we require. Furthermore, such financing would likely take the form of bank loans, private placement of debt or equity securities or some combination of these. The issuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of current investors while incurring loans, leases or debt would increase our capital requirements and possible loss of valuable assets if such obligations were not repaid in accordance with their terms.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nUnder SEC regulations, we are required to disclose off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which we have:\n\u25cf Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts,\n\u25cf Any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,\n\u25cf Any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument, except that it is both indexed to our stock and classified in shareholder equity in our statement of financial position, and\n\u25cf Any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS DESCRIPTION\nRayont Inc. (formerly Velt International Group Inc., or Rayont or the Company) is a Nevada corporation formed on February 7, 2011. Rayont uses scientific tools such as DNA, microbiome, iridology and other tests to diagnose and personalize the prescription of natural complementary medicine products, services and treatments to our patients in the markets we operate.\nGiven the acquisition of THF Holdings Pty Ltd and Rayont International (Labuan) Inc as well as the cancer treatment assets that the Company has invested on, Rayont has been focusing on commercializing these investments. The commercialization of the current assets for cancer treatment requires medical board approval for almost all of the countries subject to the license. Rayont has conducted the initial study to identify the requirements for obtaining the approvals for using PDT to treat cancer across different jurisdictions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The same PDT technology has been licensed in China, Australia and New Zealand. It is currently undergoing medical trials in Australia and China. The recent announcements show positive results that the technology works. The Company believes that it will take time before it can start commercializing these assets and start to generate revenues and operating profits.

In addition, the acquisition was accounted for business combination under common control. The method of accounting for such transfers, as well as the acquisition of businesses, was similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying amount of net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity are carried forward to the balance sheet of the combined entity. The amount by which the proceeds paid by the Company differs from Prema Lifes historical carrying value of the acquired business is accounted for as a return of capital or contribution of capital. In addition, transfers of net assets between entities under common control were accounted for as if the transfer occurred from the date that the Company and the acquired business were both under the common control and had begun operations. Prema Life Pty Ltd was sold on September 1, 2022.\nOn December 23, 2020, pursuant to an Acquisition Agreement, Rayont Australia Pty Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Rayont Inc.

The Seller is an affiliate of the Company and therefore the acquisition is being treated as a related party transaction. In addition, the acquisition was accounted for business combination under common control. The method of accounting for such transfers, as well as the acquisition of businesses, was similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying amount of net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity are carried forward to the balance sheet of the combined entity. The amount by which the proceeds paid by the Company differs from GGLG \u2018s historical carrying value of the acquired business is accounted for as a return of capital or contribution of capital. In addition, transfers of net assets between entities under common control were accounted for as if the transfer occurred from the date that the Company and the acquired business were both under the common control and had begun operations. The purchase price is $605,920, which is a 10% discount of the total amount of GGLGs net tangible assets. The purchase price will be paid in six installments after a $265,300 down payment. In the event an installment payment is not paid timely, the Seller has agreed to accept shares of the Company valued at $0.87 per share.

The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary. All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys current liabilities exceeded its current assets by $83,884 and had an accumulated loss of $3,634,943. Furthermore, the Company incurred a negative cash flow from operating activities of $169,145 during the year. These indicate adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. These adverse conditions are negative financial trends, specifically negative working capital, recurring operating losses, accumulated deficit and other adverse key financial ratios.\nThe Company generated revenues to cover its operating expense during the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company plans to continue obtaining funding from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company to support the Companys normal business operating. There is no assurance, however, that the Company will be successful in raising the needed capital and, if funding is available, that it will be available on terms acceptable to the Company.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.\nConcentration of Risk\nThe Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash in bank.\nThere is one customer who accounted for 10% or more of the Companys accounts receivable for the year ended June 30, 2022 and there is one customer who accounted for 10% or more of the Companys accounts receivable for the year as of June 30, 2021.\nThere is no supplier who accounted for 10% or more of the Companys purchases nor with significant outstanding payables for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys current financial assets and liabilities approximated their fair values due to the short maturities. The fair value of noncurrent financial assets and liabilities are determined based on the value of the discounted cash flows. The Company believes no material difference exists between the fair value and carry amounts of the noncurrent financial assets and liabilities\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the Company had cash in bank of $ 185,782 and $243,610 respectively.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets for purchased are recognized and measured at cost upon acquisition and consist of the Companys exclusive license with various useful life.\nAs of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the Company had intangible assets of $0 and $2,245,231 respectively associated with Rayont Internationals exclusive license for registering and commercializing PhotosoftTM technology for treatment of all cancers across Sub-Sahara African region. The technology has been licensed in Australia, New Zealand, China, Malaysia and Sub-Sahara Africa which is sold on June 29, 2022. The other intangible assets are associated with trademark, website, software that Rayont Technologies Pty Ltd entered into an agreement on October 15, 2020 to purchase the assets of Workstar Tech (Aust) Pty Ltd. This company was sold on January 31, 2022. Intangible assets are not part of the balance sheets as of June 30, 2022 anymore.\nIn addition, on February 5, 2021 Rayont Technologies (M) Sdn Bhd entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Sage Interactive Sdn Bhd to purchase intangible assets include software for remote learning, customer contracts and digital content. As of June 30, 2021, the carrying amount of this asset is $100,625. This company was sold on January 31, 2022 and its intangible assets are not part of the balance sheets as of June 30, 2022.\nFor other intangible assets, company determined the useful life of the asset as 10 years and its amortized based on the useful life.\nThe Company tests for indefinite lived intangibles impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable. In accordance with its policies, the Company performed a qualitative assessment of indefinite lived intangibles at June 30, 2022, and determined there was no impairment of indefinite lived intangibles.\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment are carried at cost and, less accumulated depreciation. The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in income in the year of disposal. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.\nThe Companys property and equipment mainly consists of computer and laser equipment. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 4-40 years.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets when changes in circumstances or event could impact the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets. Recoverability of long-lived assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows related to the long-lived assets to their carrying value. Impairment is determined by comparing the present value of future undiscounted cash flows, or some other fair value measure, to the carrying value of the asset. For the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, no impairment of long-lived assets was indicated, and no impairment loss was recorded.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those products and services. We enter into contracts that include products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers.\nThe Companys contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each performance obligation as each obligation is earned. The Company derives its revenues the follows:\nDigital Learning Solutions:\nRevenue from digital learning solutions is recognized when control has transferred to the customer which typically occurs when the service is completed or the delivery of the license to the customer.\nSale of Goods - Medicinal Supplements:\nRevenue from these sales is recognized when the entity has delivered the products to locations specified by its customers and the customers have accepted the products in accordance with the sales contract.\nProducts are sold to certain customers with volume discount and these customers also have the right to return within a reasonable time frame.

Under the guidance of ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized, rather it is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. An impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and would be measured as the excess carrying value of goodwill over the derived fair value of goodwill. The Companys policy is to perform an annual impairment testing for its reporting units of each fiscal year. For the years ended June 30, 2022, the Company determined there were no indicators of impairment of goodwill.\nOn April 1, 2022 under the agreement Rayont Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary No More Knots Holdings Pty Ltd, acquired 100% of the total outstanding shares and units of No More Knots Pty Ltd, No More Knots (Taringa) Pty Ltd and No More Knots (Newmarket) Pty Ltd in exchange for AUD3,000,000 (approximately USD 2,247,865) cash, payable in two tranches.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, in order to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures.\nThe evaluation of our disclosure controls by our principal executive officer included a review of the controls objectives and design, the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that there were significant deficiency in our internal controls over Financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 and they were therefore not as effective as they could be to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. The significant deficiency in our controls and procedure were lack of formal documents such as invoices and lack of evidence for proper approval and review of disbursements. Management does not believe that any of these significant deficiency materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance with as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework that was issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagements assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuers internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended June 30, 2022. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows some weaknesses and are not effective. We have identified certain weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the Companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nSubsequent to the end of the period covered by this report, and in light of the weakness described above, management is in the process of designing and implementing improvements in its internal control over financial reporting and we currently plan tom hire an independent third party consultant to assist in identifying and determining the appropriate accounting procedures and controls to implement.
