Business.\nOVERVIEW\nCantaloupe, Inc., previously known as USA Technologies, Inc., is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are a digital payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the unattended retail market. We are transforming the unattended retail world by offering a single platform for self-service commerce which includes integrated payments processing and software solutions that handle inventory management, pre-kitting, route logistics, warehouse and back-office management. Our enterprise-wide platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers ranging from vending machine companies to operators of micro-markets, car wash, electric vehicle charging stations, commercial laundry, kiosks, amusements and more, can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively.\nWe derive the majority of our revenues from subscription and transaction fees resulting from transactions on, as well as connectivity and telemetry services provided by, our ePort\u00ae cashless devices, Seed\u2122 software, and our Quick Connect API services. These services include digital payment processing, loyalty programs, inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, and intelligent merchandising. Devices operating on the Companys platform and using our services include those resulting from the sale, finance or a monthly bundled subscription (Cantaloupe ONE program) of our point of sale (\"POS\") electronic payment devices, telemetry devices or certified payment software or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals or telemetry devices. The majority of ePort customers pay a monthly service fee plus a blended percentage rate on transaction volumes. Transaction fees on volumes processed through the Companys payment devices, are the most significant driver of the Companys revenues.\nOur customers range from global food service organizations to small businesses that operate primarily in self-serve retail markets including food and beverage vending, micro-markets, amusement and arcade machines, commercial laundry, air/vacuum, car wash, electric vehicle, and various other self-serve kiosk applications as well as equipment developers or manufacturers who incorporate our hardware, software, and services into their product offerings.\nTHE INDUSTRY\nWe offer a variety of solutions in unattended retail, which enable the acceptance of digital payments and allow our customers to simplify inventory, analytics, warehouse, logistics, and back-office management. We believe the following industry trends are\ndriving growth in demand for digital payment systems and advanced logistics management in general and more specifically within the markets we serve:\nIncreased adoption of cashier-less models via vending machines or self-service kiosks to meet demand for and more use of fast, simple and seamless digital purchase and payment experiences;\nRising consumer demand for transaction convenience, safety, and security which we have seen in the growth in digital payment adoption, especially contactless payments, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\nOngoing labor challenges drive increased utility of actionable operational business intelligence from new technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to drive operational efficiencies and operational transparency through modern, cloud-based logistics and inventory management solutions.\nShift Toward Digital Payments Is Here to Stay.\nOne lasting impact of COVID-19 was the creation of a \u2018new normal for businesses and shoppers alike, accelerating the secular shift to self-service commerce. According to The Visa Back to Business Global Study: 2022 Small Business Outlook (the \"Visa Study\"); 73% of small businesses surveyed said that new forms of digital payments are fundamental to their growth. In addition, according to the Visa Study, 41% of consumers surveyed said they either plan to shift to using only digital payments within the next two years, or are already cashless. Lastly, 82% of small businesses surveyed said they will accept digital options in 2022 and nearly half (46%) of consumers surveyed expect to use digital payments more often in 2022, with just 4% saying they will use them less. The acceleration towards digital payments amongst surveyed consumers was primarily driven by benefits such as easier online shopping, personal safety and convenience.\nIncreasing Consumer Interest in Self-Service Models\nCashier-less stores that minimize or remove human intervention have shifted consumer expectations on retail shopping experiences. A consumer survey of 2,000 people across the United States performed by the Company and CITE Research in 2021 found that 83% of consumers who increased unattended retail usage during the pandemic expect to continue using it at elevated levels when the pandemic was over. And consumers are not just looking for traditional food and beverage offerings through unattended, as 82% of respondents cited an interest in purchasing nontraditional items through vending machines, with the interest significantly increasing since the last survey in 2019. Clothing and health and beauty products had the greatest two-year increase with 70% - 71% of respondents interested in purchasing these items from vending machines in 2021 compared to 55% for clothing and 64% for health and beauty in 2019 respectively.\nOUR SOLUTION\nWe continue to transform the unattended retail market by offering one integrated solution for payments processing, logistics, and back-office management. Our platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising, and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively. We offer customers several different ways to connect and manage their distributed assets. These range from our ePort cashless hardware, Seed platform, and our Quick Connect web services. Our platform is designed to transmit from our customers terminal or location payment information for processing, sales, and performance data for asset optimization and reporting to our customers within the Seed platform, as well as third-party software solutions, providing greater control and visibility of their business. Through our platform, we enable customers to easily manage assets, make changes, and push updates all remotely, ensuring they run as efficiently as possible.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur hardware includes ePort, the Companys integrated payment device, as well as Yoke POS, the Companys point-of-sale terminal, which are both currently deployed in self-service, unattended market applications such as vending, micro-markets, amusement, arcade, commercial laundry, air/vacuum, car wash, and others.

All inbound consumer billing inquiries are handled through a 24-hour help desk, thereby reducing our customers exposure to consumer billing inquiries and potential chargebacks. We provide remote maintenance updates and enhancements to software, settings, and features to ePort card readers via wireless connections.\nCOMPETITION\nThe unattended retail industry is highly competitive with service providers ranging from well-established enterprises to early stage companies within the financial technology and software services industries. The markets for Cantaloupes products and services are characterized by evolving industry standards, aggressive pricing, continuous innovation, and changing consumer trends. Many of the companys competitors are challenging Cantaloupes industry leading position, particularly when it comes to pricing, emulating products, services, and marketing, as well as addressing consumer trends. However, we believe we have competitive strengths that position us favorably.\nConsumers are expecting more from their shopping experience, with access to buy what they want, when they want, with the ability to pay with any shape or form of digital currency. This has led to a multitude of new devices on the market to enable a more engaging experience at the POS. In addition, micro markets are becoming one of the largest growth sectors in the convenience services industry, with large competitors owning a majority of the current market share. While we believe we have a strong competitive offering that positions us favorably in software services for unattended retail, competitors are entering the market with modernized back-end systems that are focused on the user interface along with real-life product planogram possibilities.\nMARKETS WE SERVE\nWhile the below key verticals represent only a fraction of our total market potential, as described below, these are the areas where we have gained the most traction to date.\nVending. According to the 2020 Census of the Convenience Services Industry (conducted biannually), a study conducted by the NAMA Foundation and research firm Technomic, the US Convenience Services Industry, which consists of vending machines, micro markets, OCS and pantry services, represented total annual revenues of approximately $16 billion in 2020 compared to total annual revenues of approximately $27 billion in 2019, reflecting a reduction of approximately $11 billion and 40%. This was due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The Convenience Services Industry is expected to be 64% larger in 2022 compared to 2020, and operators expect a full recovery to 2019 industry levels (pre-pandemic levels) by 2022-2023. In 2020, 80% of the Convenience Services Industry's total annual revenues came from the Vending vertical while Micro Markets, OCS and Pantry Services verticals represented approximately 12%, 7% and 1% of total annual revenues respectively.\nMicro Markets and Kiosks. According to the Automatic Merchandisers State of the Industry Annual Report published in July 2022, the vending and micro market business operators surveyed indicated that the number of micro market locations served increased 70% in 2021. This demonstrates that while COVID-19 impacted growth and new location placements in 2020, micro markets continued to experience a significant level of growth coming out of the pandemic. We believe the desire to diversify product offerings to employees, while giving them their own convenience store with a micro market, will continue to increase. Our primary opportunity in the micro markets vertical is providing a fully integrated solution to our customers which includes a point-of-sale platform and leveraging the Seed Markets offering to optimize our customers payments and logistics services including integrated route scheduling, warehouse pre-picking, and reporting. While micro markets continue to grow in the traditional vending and food service industry, self-service kiosks are also on the rise. According to the 2022 Kiosk Marketplace Census Report, the 2021 Zebra Technologies Global Shopper Study found that nearly half (47%) of shoppers used retail self-checkouts, a 7% year-on-year increase, and 91% of these said they will continue using the technology.\nVehicle Services. Our primary opportunities in the vehicle services markets relate to businesses that provide air, vacuum, car wash, electric car charging and parking services. In these sectors we can provide customers with cashless payment terminals, payment processing, telemetry services for data and connectivity services, as well as software solutions to improve business\noptimization. Currently, we partner with a leader in the air vending services by equipping their machines with our cashless acceptance devices.\nAmusement and Entertainment. Our current customers and primary opportunities in the amusement and entertainment markets are typically classified as street/route business, which are standalone businesses that are open to the general public and that offer card/coin-operated games such as claw machines, amusement park machines (i.e. body dryers), bowling alleys and bar entertainment (e.g. digital music machines and dart machines). Currently, we partner with one of the largest independent claw machine providers to enable them with cashless acceptance devices and payment processing.\nLaundry. Our primary opportunities in laundry consist of the coin-operated commercial laundry and multi-housing laundry markets. Currently, our joint solution with an industry leader competes with hardware manufacturers, who provide joint solutions to their customers in partnership with payment processors, and with at least one competitor who provides an integrated hardware and payment processing solution.\nOUR GROWTH OPPORTUNITY\nOur primary objective is to continue to enhance our position as a leading provider of technology that enables electronic payment transactions, advanced logistics management, and value-added services primarily at small-ticket, self-service retail locations such as vending, kiosks, electric vehicle charging. commercial laundry, and other similar markets. We plan to execute our growth strategy organically and through strategic acquisitions. Key elements of our strategy are to:\nMaximize Growth in Existing Customers/Partners. Our current customers have seen the benefits of our products and services and we believe they continue to represent the largest opportunity to scale recurring revenue and connections, through the addition of new products and services, as well as expanding our footprint of current product offerings. We are continuously enhancing our solutions and services with additional features and functionality that create add-on service offerings to existing customers such as RPC, HIVERY Enhance integration and Yoke POS. We believe our continued innovation will lead to further adoption of Cantaloupes solutions and services in the unattended POS payments market.\nCapitalize on the Emerging Contactless, EMV, NFC, and Growing Mobile Payments Trends. With more than 90% of our digital connected base enabled to accept NFC payments (including mobile wallets), we believe that continued consumer preference towards contactless payments, including mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay, represent a significant opportunity for the Company to further drive adoption in the current markets as well as new unattended kiosk applications in which we can provide services and solutions. Through innovation well seek to offer consumers more ways to pay leveraging digital wallets such as pay with crypto, or other digital-like applications.\nExpand into Micro Markets. With the Companys Yokes POS platform, we will continue to penetrate into the growing vertical of micro markets both in near-vending channels as well as small business retail. Self-service or self-checkout is on the rise and with our seamlessly integrated offering or standalone solution of Yoke POS, we believe we are positioned well to deliver a scalable micro market solution for businesses of all kinds. We plan to differentiate ourselves by providing a single platform to manage consumer and operational aspects of micro markets, while also integrating multiple service providers for flexibility and ultimate ease to our customers.\nFurther Penetrate Attractive Adjacent Markets. We plan to continue to introduce our turn-key solutions and services to various adjacent markets such as the small business retail market to enable self-checkout solutions, along with other key growth verticals like electric car charging where well leverage our expertise in digital payment solutions and telemetry services for data and asset management services. We plan to leverage the Seed platform to extend route optimization tools into other verticals where static schedules are not optimal for service visits. In addition, Seed Pros patented dynamic route scheduling capabilities can support optimal servicing and decreased operational costs.\nCapitalize on Opportunities in International Markets. We are currently focused on the U.S. and Canadian markets for our ePort devices, Yoke POS terminals, and the Seed platform, but will seek to establish a presence in unattended retail markets to provide electronic payments and logistics optimization outside of the U.S. and Canada. In order to do so, we have dedicated sales resources to spearhead international opportunities, starting with Latin America, and Europe.\nComprehensive Service and Support. In addition to its industry-leading ePort digital payments system, Yoke POS terminal, Seed logistics software, the Company seeks to provide its customers with a comprehensive platform designed to encourage optimal return on investment through business planning and performance optimization; acceptance of crypto payments, and a\nloyalty and rewards program for consumer engagement; sales data and machine alerts; DEX data transmission; and the ability to extend digital payments capabilities and the full suite of services across multiple aspects of an operators business including the micro-markets contract food industry, online and mobile payments.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nOur sales strategy includes both direct sales and channel development, depending on the particular dynamics of each of our markets. Our direct sale efforts are supported by both inside and external sales team members, which are aligned to serve our enterprise and our small- and medium-business (SMB) customers and prospects. In order to expand our sales reach, we have agreements with resellers in select market segments. Our marketing strategy includes advertising and outreach initiatives designed to build brand awareness, position our companys thought leadership within unattended retail, make clear our competitive strengths, and prove the value of our products and services to our opportunity markets. Activities include creating a vibrant company and product presence on the web, digital advertising, Search Engine Optimization (\"SEO\"), and social media; the use of direct mail and email campaigns; educational and instructional online training sessions; content curation through blogs, whitepapers, guides, podcasts, and joint industry studies; advertising in vertically-oriented trade publications; participating in industry tradeshows and events; and working closely with customers and key strategic partners on co-marketing opportunities that drive customer and consumer adoption of our services.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we are marketing and selling our products primarily through our full and part-time sales and marketing staff consisting of 44 people.\nIMPORTANT RELATIONSHIPS\nOur most important relationships are with our almost 24,000 customers, which are governed by services agreements that provide for terms and conditions of purchase, rental, subscription or lease of the devices, licensing of our solutions, and processing services. Under the terms, we typically collect our fees from settled funds, including activation fees, monthly service fees, and transaction processing fees. Our relationships with certain large customers are governed by customized terms and conditions contained within individually negotiated services agreements.\nWe maintain broad and long-standing relationships with card industry associations, including our listing on the Visa Global Registry of Service Providers. From time to time, we enter into short-term incentive and promotional agreements with the card industry counterparties.\nWe maintain close relationships with domestic wireless telecommunications carriers and with which we have long-term bespoke pricing and support terms.\nWe have long-term agreements with our payment processors, each of which is seamlessly integrated with our products and customers.\nWe have established reseller relationships with select solution providers for add-on features and services within our traditional offerings\nAs part of our strategy to expand our sales reach while optimizing resources, we have agreements with select resellers within the industries we serve.\nLastly, we have a number of key technology vendors supporting our network environment and technology, our product development and our product offerings.\nMANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN\nWe utilize independent third-party manufacturing partners to produce the substantial majority of our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers.

We have taken, and will continue to take, actions in accordance with the applicable local guidance, such as the guidance provided by the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, to protect our employees so they can safely and effectively perform their work duties.\nAnnually we request our employees to complete a Company-wide employee engagement survey. The survey is facilitated internally through our Human Resources department. The survey reflects questions to gauge employee sentiments toward current trends and issues including company direction and strategy, communication by management, individual development, team culture, and overall satisfaction. With the information provided by the annual engagement survey, leadership is provided key insights and valuable feedback which we continue to implement in our Company-wide action plans with the intent to focus on key areas to prioritize, enhance, and drive continued increase in employee engagement, learning and development, and professional growth for our employees.\nAVAILABLE INFORMATION\nThe public may access any materials the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements for our annual stockholder meetings, and amendments to those reports, through the SECs Interactive Data Electronic Applications system at http://www.sec.gov.

Risk Factors.\nThe risks and uncertainties describe below are not the only ones we face. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. The occurrence of any of these risks could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.\nSummary\nYou should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below. Our business operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed, including risks regarding the following:\nRisks related to our business and our industry:\nGeneral economic, market or business conditions unrelated to our operating performance, including global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have a history of losses since inception and if we continue to incur losses, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to significantly and adversely impact our business.\nImpacts of widespread inflation could negatively affect our industry.\nIf we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSubstantially all of the network service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty to sixty days advance notice.\nWe may not successfully implement our go-to-market strategy which may adversely affect growth and profitability.\nWe engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas.\nOur ability to commercially manage the transition from the 3G network could lead to competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and increase net losses.\nIncreases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nOur efforts to expand into international markets may not be successful; our products and services may not gain traction in new markets; managing international operations may be challenging or may fail.\nGeopolitical conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOperational and liquidity:\nWe depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, or if we are unable to attract highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nDisruptions to our systems, breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services, or failure of our processing systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nThe termination of our relationships with certain third-party suppliers upon whom we rely for services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan.\nWe rely on other card payment processors, and if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services or we fail to operate in compliance with the requirements of those relationships, our customer relationships could be adversely affected, and we could lose business.\nDisruptions at other participants in the financial system could prevent us from delivering our cashless payment services.\nAny increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nWe may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.\nFailure to comply with any of the financial covenants under the Companys credit agreement could result in an event of default which may accelerate our outstanding indebtedness or other obligations and have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nWe may not fully realize the benefits of acquisitions, it may take longer than we anticipate for us to achieve those benefits, they may be difficult to integrate, may disrupt our business, or divert management attention and may adversely affect our financial condition.\nLegal, regulatory, and compliance risks:\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe accounting review of our previously issued financial statements and the audits of prior fiscal years have been time-consuming and expensive, has resulted in claims and lawsuits , and may result in additional expense and/or litigation.\nMatters relating to or arising from the restatement and the 2019 Investigation, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers, and enforcement proceedings could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nRemaining regulatory matters may require significant time and attention, result in substantial expenses and lead to adverse publicity.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors could be subject to future claims and lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks related to our common stock:\nDirector and officer liability is limited and shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThere is a risk that we may be dropped from inclusion in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nUpon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to distribute the liquidation preference then due to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.\nRisks related to our business and our industry\nGeneral economic, market or business conditions unrelated to our operating performance, including global supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe global payments technology industry depends heavily on the overall level of consumer, business and government spending. We are exposed to general economic conditions that affect consumer confidence, spending, and discretionary income and changes in consumer purchasing habits. A sustained deterioration in general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate, supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure or interest rate fluctuations, may adversely affect our financial performance by reducing the number or active devices, active customers and total number of transactions using our payment solutions.\nA downturn in the economy and other adverse economic trends may accelerate the timing, or increase the impact of, risks to our financial performance. These trends could include the following:\nlow levels of consumer and business confidence typically associated with recessionary environments may result in decreased spending by consumers;\nhigh unemployment may result in decreased spending by consumers;\nbudgetary concerns in the United States and other countries could affect sovereign credit ratings, and impact consumer confidence and spending;\nsupply chain disruptions may result in decreased spending by consumers whose ability to provide goods and services is materially impacted;\nsupply chain disruptions could impact our ability to purchase devices for existing or prospective customers;\ncurrent and potential future inflationary pressures may adversely impact spending by consumers;\nemerging market economies tend to be more sensitive to adverse economic trends than the more established markets we serve;\nIn addition, climate-related events, including extreme weather events and natural disasters and their effect on critical infrastructure in the U.S. or internationally, could have similar adverse effects on our customers and our operations.\nFurthermore, shareholders, customers and other stakeholders have begun to consider how corporations are addressing environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. Government regulators, investors, customers and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures, and views about ESG are diverse and rapidly changing. These shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock if investors determine that the Company has not made sufficient progress on ESG matters. We could also face potential negative ESG-related publicity in traditional media or social media if shareholders or other stakeholders determine that we have not adequately considered or addressed ESG matters.\nWe have a history of losses since inception and if we continue to incur losses, the price of our shares can be expected to fall.\nWe experienced losses from inception through June 30, 2012, and from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2022. For fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred a net loss of $1.7 million, $8.7 million, and $40.6 million, respectively. In light of our recent history of losses as well as the length of our history of losses, profitability in the foreseeable future is not assured. Until we achieve profitability, we will be required to use our cash and cash equivalents on hand and may raise capital to meet cash flow requirements including the issuance of common stock or debt financing. Additionally, if we continue to incur losses in the future, the price of our common stock can be expected to fall.\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has and may continue to significantly and adversely impact our business.\nThe global spread of the COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption on our business. Electronic payment transaction volume within unattended markets decreased significantly at the onset of the\npandemic, as government authorities imposed forced closure of non-essential businesses and social distancing protocols, significantly reducing foot traffic to distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions and reducing discretionary spending by consumers.\nAs a result of COVID-19, the technology industry is experiencing disruptions within its supply chain. We have experienced, and may continue to experience delays in securing the components and finished goods of our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers. Supply chain delays could cause shortages of our hardware products, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and acquire customers and could adversely impact our financial results.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; potential mutations of COVID-19; the efficacy of vaccines and treatment developments and their deployment; governmental, business and individuals actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; and the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response. Furthermore, even as containment measures are lifted there can be no assurance as to whether further measures will be implemented, or the time required to sustain operations and sales at pre-pandemic levels. There may also be increased marketplace consolidation as companies are challenged to respond to the continued evolving conditions of COVID-19.\nA sustained or recurring downturn could result in a decrease in the fair value of our goodwill or other intangible assets, causing them to exceed their carrying value. This may require us to recognize an impairment to those assets. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic could decrease consumer spending, adversely affect demand for our technology and services, cause one or more of our customers and partners to file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business, cause one or more of our customers to fail to renew, terminate, or renegotiate their contracts, affect the ability of our sales team to travel to potential customers, impact expected spending from new customers and negatively impact collections of accounts receivable, all of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In response to the outbreak, we agreed to concessions on price and/or payment terms with certain customers who have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may negotiate additional concessions on price and/or payment terms.\nIt is not possible for us to predict the future impact of the pandemic and its effects on our business, results of operations or financial condition at this time.\nThe impact of inflation could negatively affect our business, our industry, and our customer base.\nOur own costs, including labor, hardware, services, technology providers, and other variable expenses could be severely impacted by severe, widespread or continuing inflation. Our customer base includes many small businesses, some of which operate on tight margins. Our customers may not successfully navigate a rising cost environment, causing collection issues or bankruptcies. Inflation could seriously erode the discretionary buying decisions of consumers, impacting size of purchases or volumes at our unattended points of sale.\nIf we are not able to implement successful enhancements and new features for our products and services, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to develop new products and services to address the rapidly evolving market for cashless payments and cloud and mobile solutions for the self-service retail markets. Rapid and significant technological changes continue to confront the industries in which we operate, including developments in proximity payment devices. These new services and technologies may be superior to, impair, or render obsolete the products and services we currently offer or the technologies we currently use to provide them. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and we may not be successful in realizing a return on these development efforts in a timely manner or at all. There can be no assurance that any new products or services we develop and offer to our customers will achieve significant commercial acceptance. Our ability to develop new products and services may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, payment card networks, existing and future laws and regulations, resistance to change from our customers, challenges of integration with a wide variety of legacy end-point machines, or third parties intellectual property rights. If we are unable to provide enhancements and new features for our products and services or to develop new products and services that achieve market acceptance or that keep pace with rapid technological developments and evolving industry standards, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, because our products and services are designed to operate with a variety of systems, infrastructures, and devices, we need to continuously modify and enhance our products and services to keep pace with changes in mobile, software,\ncommunication, and database technologies. We may not be successful in either developing these modifications and enhancements or in bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure of our products and services to continue to operate effectively with third-party infrastructures and technologies could reduce the demand for our products and services, result in dissatisfaction of our customers, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nSubstantially all of the service contracts with our customers are terminable for any or no reason upon thirty to sixty days advance notice.\nSubstantially all of our customers may terminate their services with us for any or no reason upon providing us with thirty to sixty- days advance notice. Accordingly, consistent demand for and satisfaction with our products by our customers is critical to our financial condition and future success. Problems, outages, defects, or other issues with our products or services or competition in the marketplace could cause us to lose a substantial number of our customers with minimal notice. If a substantial number of our customers were to exercise their termination rights, it would result in a material adverse effect to our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not successfully implement our go-to-market strategy which may adversely affect growth and profitability.\nOur current core business is highly concentrated among several large customers in the vending industry. We have made inroads into other adjacent markets including micro-markets, laundry, gaming, entertainment, vehicle services, and other commercial payments applications and continued expansion into these markets is a substantial piece of our potential future growth prospects. Changing technology, customer preferences, and competitor actions may limit our ability to successfully grow and expand beyond our core business.\nWe face significant risks to our business when we engage in the outsourcing of engineering work, including outsourcing of software work overseas, which, if not properly managed, could result in the loss of valuable intellectual property and increased costs due to inefficient and poor work product, which could harm our business, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.\nWe may, from time-to-time, outsource engineering work related to the design, development, and operations of our products and services, typically to save money and gain access to additional engineering resources. We have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Ukraine, Columbia, and India. If we are unable to properly manage and oversee the outsourcing of engineering and other work to third parties located internationally that operate under different laws and regulations than those in the U.S., we could suffer the loss of valuable intellectual property, or the loss of the ability to claim such intellectual property, including patents and trade names. Additionally, instead of saving money, we could in fact incur significant additional costs because of inefficient engineering services and poor work product. As a result, our business would be harmed, including our financial results, reputation, and brand.\nOur ability to commercially manage the transition from the 3G network could lead to competitive disadvantage in the marketplace.\nOur transition away from the 3G wireless network is nearing completion as the cellular service providers phase these networks out in North America through the end of the 2022 calendar year. This transition has and will continue to affect many of our active devices and has required significant customer retention programs and resources to ensure that our existing customer base is properly transitioned to the new platform. This change affects our industry and will also lead to changes with our competitors and their customers. Our ability to successfully transition the remaining impacted devices and provide the new platform for our existing and new customers is critical to our strategy, our network and to the competitive landscape in the marketplace.\nThe loss of one or more of our key customers could significantly reduce our revenues, results of operations, and increase net losses.\nWe have derived, and believe we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from one large customer or a limited number of large customers. Customer concentrations for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nFor the year ended June 30,\nSingle customer 2022 2021 2020\nTotal revenue 14 % 16 % 16 %\nThe loss of such customers could materially adversely affect our revenues. Additionally, a major customer in one year may not purchase any of our products or services in another year, which may negatively affect our financial performance. We have offered, and may in the future offer, discounts to our large customers to incentivize them to continue to utilize our products and services. If we are required to sell products to any of our large customers at reduced prices or unfavorable terms, our revenue and earnings could be materially adversely affected. Further, there is no assurance that our customers will continue to utilize our transaction processing and related services as our customer agreements are generally cancellable by the customer on thirty to sixty days notice.\nIncreases in card association and debit network interchange fees could increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.\nWe are obligated to pay interchange fees and other network fees set by the bankcard networks to the card issuing bank and the bankcard networks for each transaction we process through our network. From time to time, card associations and debit networks increase the organization and/or processing fees, known as interchange fees that they charge. Under our processing agreements with our customers, we are permitted to pass along these fee increases to our customers through corresponding increases in our processing fees. Passing along such increases could result in some of our customers canceling their contracts with us. Consequently, it is possible that competitive pressures will result in our Company absorbing some or all of the increases in the future, which would increase our operating costs, reduce our gross profit and adversely affect our business.\nWe are expending significant resources into certain international initiatives. Our efforts may fail, adversely affecting our results.\nAs we expand into international markets, we may not be successful, or our plans may be delayed. Our Company is inexperienced in managing international operations. Our products will need to be localized in some cases and if our localization efforts fail or are delayed or our products and services do not gain traction in new markets, our business could be adversely affected.\nGeopolitical conflicts, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWhile we do not currently have employees, customers or corporate offices in impacted areas, we have worked, and expect to work in the future, with companies located in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., including, but not limited to Ukraine. In addition, we are focused on international expansion. As a result, our operations and international expansion efforts could be impacted by economic, political and other conditions resulting from the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which could, among other things, lead to a reduction in consumer, government or corporate spending, international sanctions, embargoes, heightened inflation, volatility in global financial markets, increased cyber disruptions or attacks, higher supply chain costs and increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, which could result in charges related to the recoverability of assets, including financial assets, long-lived assets and goodwill and other losses, and could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. To the extent the invasion of Ukraine by Russia adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks disclosed in this Form 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOperational and liquidity\nWe depend on our key personnel and, if they leave us, or if we are unable to attract highly skilled personnel, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success and future growth also depends, to a significant degree, on the skills and continued services of our management team. Further, due to the complexity of the work required to make needed improvements within the Company, it may be difficult for us to retain existing senior management and new hires, sales personnel, and development and engineering personnel critical to our ability to execute our business plan, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. We may experience a loss of productivity due to the departure of key personnel and the associated loss of institutional knowledge, or while new personnel integrate into our business and transition into their respective roles. Our future success also depends on our ability to attract and motivate highly skilled technical, managerial, sales, marketing and customer service personnel, including members of our management team. The labor market has been very challenging this fiscal year, with several key functions and departments experiencing high turnover. These changes are disruptive and expensive. Continued turnover could prevent us from achieving,\nor significantly delay achievement, of our business and operational goals and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDisruptions to our systems, breaches in the security of transactions involving our products or services, or failure of our processing systems could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to transmit financial information of consumers making cashless transactions and to provide accounting and inventory management services to our customers. As such, the information we transmit and/or maintain is exposed to the ever-evolving threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, cyber-attack or unauthorized or fraudulent use by consumers, customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. A cybersecurity breach could result in disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property, or cause operational disruptions and compromised data. We may be unable to anticipate or prevent techniques to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems because they change frequently and often are not detected until after an incident has occurred.\nIn addition, our processing systems may experience errors, interruptions, delays or damage from a number of causes, including, but not limited to, power outages, hardware, software and network failures, internal design, manual or usage errors, terrorism, workplace violence or wrongdoing, catastrophic events, climate-related events such as natural disasters and severe weather conditions. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks, including annual validation of our compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact the marketplace acceptance of our products and services, and could result in significant remedial expenses to not only assess and repair any damage to our systems, but also to reimburse customers for losses that occur from service interruptions or the fraudulent use of confidential data. Additionally, we could become subject to significant fines, litigation, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results.\nIn addition, following an acquisition, we take steps to ensure our data and system security protection measures cover the acquired business as part of our integration process. As such, there may be a period of increased cybersecurity risk during the period between closing an acquisition and the completion of our data and system security integration.\nThe termination of our relationships with certain third-party suppliers upon whom we rely for services that are critical to our products could adversely affect our business and delay achievement of our business plan.\nThe operation of our networked devices depends upon the capacity, reliability and security of services provided to us by our wireless telecommunication services providers, equipment manufacturers and other suppliers. In addition, if we terminate relationships with our current telecommunications service providers and other third-party suppliers, we may have to replace hardware that is part of our existing ePort or Seed products that are already installed in the marketplace. This could significantly harm our reputation and could cause us to lose customers and revenues.\nWe rely on other card payment processors, and if they fail or no longer agree to provide their services or we fail to operate in compliance with the requirements of those relationships, our customer relationships could be adversely affected, and we could lose business.\nWe rely on agreements with other large payment processing organizations, primarily Fiserv Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Global Payments, Inc. to enable us to provide card authorization, data capture and transmission, settlement and merchant accounting services for the customers we serve. The termination by our card processing providers of their arrangements with us or their failure to perform their services efficiently and effectively would adversely affect our relationships with the customers whose accounts we serve and may cause those customers to terminate their processing agreements with us.\nFurther, substantially all of the cashless payment transactions handled by our network involve Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa) or MasterCard International Incorporated (\"MasterCard\"). If we fail to comply with the applicable standards or requirements of the Visa and MasterCard card associations relating to security, Visa or MasterCard could suspend or terminate our registration with them. The termination of our registration with them or any changes in the Visa or MasterCard rules that would impair our registration with them could require us to stop providing cashless payment services through our network. In such event, our business plan and/or competitive advantages in the market place would be materially adversely affected.\nDisruptions at other participants in the financial system could prevent us from delivering our cashless payment services.\nThe operations and systems of many participants in the financial system are interconnected. Many of the transactions that involve our cashless payment services rely on multiple participants in the financial system to accurately move funds and\ncommunicate information to the next participant in the transaction chain. A disruption for any reason at one of the participants in the financial system could impact our ability to cause funds to be moved in a manner to successfully deliver our services. Although we work with other participants to avoid any disruptions, there is no assurance that such efforts will be effective. Such a disruption could lead to the inability for us to deliver services, reputational damage, lost customers and lost revenue, loss of customers confidence, as well as additional costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, profitability, financial condition, and future growth.\nAny increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIn the event a dispute between a cardholder and a customer is not resolved in favor of the customer, the transaction is normally charged back to the customer and the purchase price is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. When we serve as merchant of record, if we are unable to collect such amounts from the customer's account, or if the customer refuses or is unable, due to closure, bankruptcy or other reasons, to reimburse us for a chargeback, we bear the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. We may experience significant losses from chargebacks in the future. Any increase in chargebacks not paid by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have policies to manage customer-related credit risk and attempt to mitigate such risk by monitoring transaction activity. Notwithstanding our programs and policies for managing credit risk, it is possible that a default on such obligations by one or more of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur dependence on proprietary technology and limited ability to protect our intellectual property may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nChallenge to our ownership of our intellectual property could materially damage our business prospects. Our technology may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others. Our ability to execute our business plan is dependent, in part, on our ability to obtain patent protection for our proprietary products, maintain trade secret protection and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the United States Government and other countries have granted us 136 patents, of which 50 are still in force. We have a number of pending patent applications, and will consider filing applications for additional patents covering aspects of our future developments, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will maintain or prosecute these applications. There can be no assurance that:\nany of the remaining patent applications will be granted to us\u037e\nwe will develop additional products that are patentable or that do not infringe the patents of others\u037e\nany patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantages or adequate protection for our products\u037e\nany patents issued to us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others\u037e or\nany of our products would not infringe the patents of others.\nIf any of our products or services is found to have infringed any patent, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain licenses to continue to manufacture, use, sell, and license such product or service or that we will not have to pay damages and/or be enjoined as a result of such infringement.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our proprietary technology or fail to enforce or prosecute our patents against others, third parties may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could result in the loss of customers and our business being adversely affected. Patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs and diverts Company resources as well as the attention of our management. There can be no assurance we will have the necessary financial resources to appropriately defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights in connection with any such litigation.\nWe may require additional financing or find it necessary to raise capital to sustain our operations and without it we may not be able to achieve our business plan.\nAt June 30, 2022, we had a net working capital surplus of $57.4 million and cash and cash equivalents of $68.1 million. We had net cash (used in) provided by operating activities of $(8.7) million, $8.2 million, and $(14.1) million for fiscal years ended 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We may need additional funds to continue these operations. We may also need additional capital to respond to unusual or unanticipated non-operational events. Such non-operational events include but are not limited to shareholder class action lawsuits, government inquiries or enforcement actions that could potentially arise from the circumstances that gave rise to our restatements, extended filing delays in filing our periodic reports and the impact of\nCOVID-19 on our business. Should the financing that we require to sustain our working capital needs be unavailable or prohibitively expensive when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and future prospects.\nFailure to comply with any of the financial covenants under the Companys credit agreement could result in an event of default which may accelerate our outstanding indebtedness or other obligations and have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolving Facility) and a $25 million secured term facility (the Amended Secured Term Facility and together with the Amended Revolving Facility, the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility), and fully replaces our previous 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility.\nThe Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility has a four year maturity and includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. One financial covenant requires the Company to maintain, at all times, a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. The other financial covenant is conditional on a material acquisition occurring: if a material acquisition occurs, the Company is required to maintain a total leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for the next four fiscal quarters following the material acquisition.\nThe Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of June 30, 2022. Failure to comply with the foregoing financial covenants, if not cured or waived, will result in an event of default that could trigger acceleration of our indebtedness, which would require us to repay all amounts owed under the 2022 JPMorgan Credit Agreement and could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity position and financial position.\nWe cannot be certain that our future operating results will be sufficient to ensure compliance with the financial covenants in our 2022 JPMorgan Credit Agreement or to remedy any defaults. In addition, in the event of any event of default and related acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to make the accelerated payments required under the 2022 JPMorgan Credit Agreement.\nAcquisitions may adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe could acquire additional products, technologies, or businesses to complement or expand our business. We may be unable to negotiate favorable terms in a timely manner or at all. Negotiation and integration of these types of potential business combinations could divert managements time and resources. In addition, we may encounter unanticipated costs, operational challenges, or potential disruption of our business and diversion of managements attention from our core business. We may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition. We could reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or other purposes, or we could incur debt, potentially on unfavorable terms.\nLegal, regulatory, and compliance risks\nWe are subject to laws and regulations that affect the products, services and markets in which we operate. Failure by us to comply with these laws or regulations would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are, among other things, subject to certain banking regulations and credit card association regulations. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in the suspension of our business, the limitation, suspension or termination of service, and/or the imposition of fines that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, changes to legal rules and regulations, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a negative financial effect on us or our product offerings. To the extent this occurs, we could be subject to additional technical, contractual or other requirements as a condition of our continuing to conduct our payment processing business. These requirements could cause us to incur additional costs, which could be significant, or to lose revenues to the extent we do not comply with these requirements.\nThe accounting review of our previously issued financial statements and the audits of prior fiscal years have been time-consuming and expensive, has resulted in claims and lawsuits, and may result in additional expense and/or litigation.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of then-current and prior period matters relating to certain of the Companys contractual arrangements,\nincluding the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such arrangements (the 2019 Investigation).\nWe have incurred significant expenses, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the 2019 Investigation, the review of our accounting, the audits, the restatements of previously filed financial statements, bank consents, the remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the proxy solicitation, and professional services fees to assist the Company with accounting and compliance activities in fiscal year 2020 following the filing of the 2019 Form 10-K. To the extent that steps we have taken to take to reduce errors in accounting determinations are not successful, we could be forced to incur significant additional time and expense. The incurrence of significant additional expense, or the requirement that management devote significant time that could reduce the time available to execute on our business strategies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough we have completed the restatement, we cannot guarantee that we will not be subject to future claims, investigations, proceedings, inquiries from regulators and enforcement proceedings. Any future claims, investigations, inquiries or proceedings will, regardless of the outcome, likely consume a significant amount of our internal resources and result in additional costs.\nOur management has been, and may in the future be, required to devote significant time and attention to litigation and claims, and this and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as well as on our reputation.\nMatters relating to or arising from the restatement and the 2019 Investigation, including adverse publicity and potential concerns from our customers, and enforcement proceedings could continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe have previously restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year 2017 and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018. As a result, we have been and could continue to be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the restatement and adjustment of our financial statements, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from our customers or others with whom we do business. Concerns include the perception of the effort required to address our accounting and control environment and the ability for us to be a long-term provider to our customers. The continued occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm our business and have an adverse effect on our financial condition. Additionally, as a result of the restatements, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including substantial unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement. If litigation or enforcement proceedings did occur, we may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of their outcome. Likewise, such events might cause a diversion of our managements time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs.\nRemaining regulatory matters relating to U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) inquiries may require significant time and attention, result in substantial expenses and lead to adverse publicity.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company responded to a subpoena received from the DOJ that sought records regarding Company activities related to the 2019 Investigation. We cooperated fully with the DOJs queries. The DOJ staff has notified us during fiscal year 2022 that they have concluded their investigation and that they do not intend to proceed with any further investigation or enforcement. Since fiscal year 2019, the Company has received inquiries from the SEC into the facts and circumstances of the 2019 Investigation and has fully cooperated with these inquiries.\nPotential SEC enforcement could result in substantial legal and accounting expenses, divert managements attention from other business concerns and harm our business. Any civil action commenced against us could result in administrative orders against us, the imposition of significant penalties and/or fines against us, and/or the imposition of civil sanctions against us or certain of our former officers, directors and/or employees. Any regulatory action could result in the filing of additional restatements of our prior financial statements or require that we take other actions. If we are subject to an adverse finding resulting from the investigation, we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed upon us. These matters could require significant management and financial resources which could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business. Additionally, as a result of these inquiries, we could be the subject of negative publicity including negative reactions from our customers or others with whom we do business.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors could be subject to future claims and lawsuits, which could require significant additional management time and attention, result in significant additional legal expenses or result in government enforcement actions.\nWe and certain of our former officers and directors may become subject to further litigation, government investigations or proceedings arising from the 2019 Investigation. Future litigation, investigation or other actions that may be filed or initiated against us or our former officers or directors may be time consuming and expensive. We cannot predict what losses we may incur in these matters, and contingencies related to our obligations under the federal and state securities laws, or in other legal proceedings or governmental investigations or proceedings related to these matters.\nTo date, we have incurred significant costs in connection with litigation, investigations and with the special litigation committee proceedings. Any legal proceedings, if decided adversely to us, could result in significant monetary damages, penalties and reputational harm, and will likely involve significant defense and other costs. We have entered into indemnification agreements with certain of our former directors and officers, and our bylaws require us to indemnify each of our directors and officers. Further, our insurance may not cover all claims that have been or may be brought against us, and insurance coverage may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. As a result, we have been and may continue to be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, including pursuant to our indemnification obligations, which could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to maintain effective systems of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures could cause a loss of confidence in our financial reporting and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal control over financial reporting is necessary for us to provide accurate financial information. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. As discussed in Item 9A, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of June 30, 2022 due to the existence of multiple material weakness in such controls. Management is in the process of remediating the material weaknesses. We cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective as of June 30, 2023. If we are unable to adequately maintain our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, or our ability to access the capital markets. Refer to Part II, Item 9A for additional information regarding the material weaknesses that have been identified and our remediation plans.\nRisks related to our common stock\nDirector and officer liability is limited and shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty.\nAs permitted by Pennsylvania law, our by-laws limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of a directors fiduciary duty except for liability in certain instances. As a result of our by-law provisions and Pennsylvania law, shareholders may have limited rights to recover against directors for breach of fiduciary duty. In addition, our by-laws and indemnification agreements entered into by the Company with each of the officers and directors provide that we shall indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by law.\nAn active trading market for our common stock may not be maintained.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain an active trading market for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or any other exchange in the future. If an active market for our common stock is not maintained, or if we fail to satisfy the continued listing standards of Nasdaq for any reason and our securities are delisted, it may be difficult for our security holders to sell their securities without depressing the market price for the securities or at all. An inactive trading market may also impair our ability to both raise capital by selling shares of common stock and complete other acquisitions by using our shares of common stock as consideration.\nIf securities and/or industry analysts fail to continue publishing research about our business, if they change their recommendations adversely, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly for any reason, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. In addition, it is likely that, in some future period, our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock, or if our results of operations do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThere is a risk that we may be dropped from inclusion in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nAlthough we are currently included in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index, there is a risk that we could be dropped from inclusion when the list of public companies included in the Russell 2000\u00ae Index is reconstituted in May 2023 if our market capitalization falls below the minimum necessary for inclusion, which could result in a decline in demand for our common stock and, accordingly, the trading price of our common stock following such event.\nUpon certain fundamental transactions involving the Company, such as a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets, we may be required to distribute the liquidation preference then due to the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock which would reduce the amount of the distributions otherwise to be made to the holders of our common stock in connection with such transactions.\nOur articles of incorporation provide that upon a merger or sale of substantially all of our assets or upon the disposition of more than 50% of our voting power, the holders of at least 60% of the preferred stock may elect to have such transaction treated as a liquidation and be entitled to receive their liquidation preference. Upon our liquidation, the holders of our preferred stock are entitled to receive a liquidation preference prior to any distribution to the holders of common stock which, as of June 30, 2022 was approximately $22.1 million. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur headquarters are located at 100 Deerfield Lane, Suite 300, Malvern, Pennsylvania. All of our current locations are leased and expire in varying years outlined below. All of our leased facilities are used for corporate functions, product development, sales, and other purposes. We believe our existing facilities are sufficient for our current and future needs.\nLocation Approximate Monthly Base Rent Lease Expiration Approximate Size\nAtlanta, Georgia $21,000 - $22,000 June 2023 11,900 sq. ft.\nMalvern, Pennsylvania $57,000 - $61,000 November 2023 27,000 sq. ft.\nMetairie, Louisiana* $15,000 - $16,000 July 2024 7,800 sq. ft.\nDenver, Colorado* $45,000 - $53,000 December 2026 16,700 sq. ft.\n* These office space locations are no longer utilized by the Company and have been sub-leased. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nWe are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change. Assessments of losses are inherently subjective and involve unpredictable factors. It is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially and adversely affected by any developments relating to the legal proceedings, claims and investigations.\nExcept as set forth in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we are not aware of any material pending legal or governmental proceedings as of the filing date of this Annual Report to which we are party, other than routine litigation incidental to our business. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol CTLP. As of October 14, 2022, there were 510 holders of record of our common stock and 230 record holders of the preferred stock. This number does not include stockholders for whom shares were held in a nominee or street name.\nThe holders of the common stock are entitled to receive such dividends as the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time declare out of funds legally available for payment of dividends. Through the date hereof, no cash dividends have been declared on the Companys common stock or preferred stock. No dividend may be paid on the common stock until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock have been paid. As of June 30, 2022, such accumulated unpaid dividends amounted to approximately $17.7 million. The preferred stock is also entitled to a liquidation preference over the common stock which equaled approximately $22.1 million as of June 30, 2022.\nPERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe following graph shows a comparison of the 5-year cumulative total shareholder return for our common stock with The US Small-Cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index in the United States. The graph assumes a $100 investment on June 30, 2017 in our common stock and in the Small-Cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index and the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, including reinvestment of dividends.\nThe Company was added as a member of the US Small-Cap Russell 2000\u00ae Index in June 2021.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Form 10-K, as well as the discussion under Item 1A. Risk Factors. For further discussion of the business, industry, our products and services, competitive strengths, and growth strategy, see Item 1. Business. Unless stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this discussion and analysis refer to the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021. Discussion of fiscal year 2021 items and the year-over year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020 can be found in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, which was previously filed with the SEC on September 3, 2021.\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation. The changes in presentation did not affect our total revenues, total costs of sales, gross profit, total operating expenses, operating loss, net loss or net loss per common share. For further information on the presentation changes, see Item 1. Financial Statements - Note 2. Accounting Policies.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Furthermore, the period to period comparison of our historical results is not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in the future.\nOVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY\nCantaloupe, Inc., previously known as USA Technologies, Inc., is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are a digital payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the unattended retail market. We are transforming the unattended retail world by offering a single platform for self-service commerce which includes integrated payments processing and software solutions that handle inventory management, pre-kitting, route logistics, warehouse and back-office management. Our enterprise-wide platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers ranging from vending machine companies to operators of micro-markets, car wash, electric vehicle charging stations, commercial laundry, kiosks, amusements and more, can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends June 30. The Company generates revenue in multiple ways. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, we derived approximately 82% and 83% respectively, of our revenue from subscription and transaction fees and approximately 18% and 17%, respectively, of our revenue from equipment sales. Active Devices on our service include point of sale (\"POS\") electronic payment devices, certified payment software, or the servicing of similar third-party installed POS terminals. Customers can obtain POS electronic payment devices from us in the following ways:\nPurchasing devices directly from the Company or one of its authorized resellers;\nFinancing devices under the Companys QuickStart Program, which are non-cancellable sixty-month sales-type leases directly from the Company; and\nParticipating in a monthly bundled subscription under the Company's Cantaloupe ONE program, which are 36-month rental agreements that transition to month-to-month agreements after the initial subscription commitment period.\nHighlights\nHighlights of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 are below:\nApproximately 24 thousand Active Customers and 1.14 million Active Devices (as defined in Item 1. Business) connected to our service.\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Delicious Nutritious LLC, doing business as Yoke Payments (\"Yoke\"), a micro market payments company. Through the acquisition, Yoke's POS platform offers self-checkout while seamlessly integrating with Cantaloupes inventory management and payment processing platforms. During the year, we implemented the newly enhanced Yoke Micro Market Platform upgrade that includes new features and functionality for Yoke Pay, Yoke POS, and the Yoke Portal.\nA successful rollout of the ePort Engage and ePort Engage Combo devices which began shipping during the current fiscal year. ePort Engage series is our next generation of digital touchscreen devices for the market which provides retailers the ability to captivate consumers in new ways and enables truly frictionless purchasing.\nCantaloupe announced and launched a bundled subscription model, the Cantaloupe ONE Platform which provides operators the flexibility and predictability of a monthly, fixed subscription amount covering the hardware and service fees.\nEntered into an amended and restated credit agreement (the \"Amended JP Morgan Credit Facility\") with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in March 2022 that provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility and a $25 million secured term facility, which replaces our previous 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility.\nThe Company announced a partnership with HIVERY, a data-science company that specializes in Artificial Intelligence (\"AI\") technology to streamline category management for retailers in the consumer packaged goods industry. The partnership aims to provide the Company's Seed customers an enhanced merchandising technology leveraging AI and Machine Learning to improve vending machine performance. The integration was available to customers as of June 30, 2022.\nThe Company expanded its machine compatibility for remote price change (RPC), a feature within the Seed suite of services that enables customers to make price changes to products at vending machines remotely. Customers started subscribing to RPC in the quarter ended June 30, 2022.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe Company, its employees, and its customers operate in geographic locations in which its business operations and financial performance continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While businesses, schools and other organizations re-open, which has led to increased foot-traffic to distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions, the emergence of new strains and variants and resurgence of the virus, such as the outbreak of the Omicron variant in early calendar year 2022, have and may in the future lead to additional shutdowns and closures that impact our operations and financial results. Such impacts to our financial statements have in the past included, and may in the future include the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets including operating lease assets, property and equipment and allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts and finance receivables. We have concluded that there are no material impairments as a result of our evaluation for the year ended June 30, 2022. Where applicable, we have incorporated judgments and estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements based on information currently available. These judgments and estimates may change, as new events develop and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.\nWhile we are encouraged by our strong operating and financial results, we continue to monitor the evolving situation and follow guidance from federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the potential uncertainty of the situation, the Company cannot, at this time, reasonably estimate the longer-term repercussions of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP, \"GAAP\"), and they conform to general practices in our industry. The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.\nCritical accounting policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variations and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions, or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations. We apply critical accounting policies consistently from period to period and intend that any change in methodology occur in an appropriate manner.\nAccounting policies currently deemed critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations are listed below. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nRevenue Recognition. The Company derives revenue primarily from the sale or lease of equipment and services to the small ticket, unattended POS market.\nThe Companys application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements may require significant judgment in contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting.\nThe Company enters into arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which may include various combinations of equipment and services. Our equipment and service deliverables qualify as separate performance obligations and can be sold on a standalone basis. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and, where return rights exist, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within the Companys control. For these multiple deliverable arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to the deliverables based on their relative standalone selling prices. To the extent that a deliverable is subject to specific guidance on whether and/or how to allocate the consideration in a multiple element arrangement, that deliverable is accounted for in accordance with such specific guidance. The Company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered items to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or meeting other future performance obligations.\nCapitalization of internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements. We have significant expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. Capitalization of internal-use software occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development is resulting in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost of internal employees and external consultants. Internal-use software is included within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 7 years.\nWe capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements) following the internal-use software capitalization criteria described above. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support internal corporate functions, our platforms and technology offerings. Capitalized costs relating to cloud computing arrangements are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 5 years.\nGoodwill. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which, if any, the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the reporting units goodwill balance.\nThe quantitative impairment test process requires valuation of the reporting unit, which we determine using the income approach, the market approach or a combination of the two approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows derived from assumptions that include expected growth rates and revenues, projected expenses, discount rates, capital expenditures and income tax rates. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on the quoted stock price, recent equity transactions of our business, market transactions involving similar businesses and market comparables.\nThe Company has selected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. The Company has concluded there has been no impairment of goodwill during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, or 2020. As of the date of our annual impairment test for fiscal year 2022, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin. Subsequent to our annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified. As of June 30, 2022, if our estimate of the fair value of our reporting unit was 10% lower, no goodwill impairment would have existed.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. We review long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, property and equipment and operating lease right-of-use assets for potential impairment, when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances\nwhich indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment is indicated. A loss is then recognized for the difference, if any, between the fair value of the asset (as estimated by management using its best judgment) and the carrying value of the asset. If actual market value is less favorable than that estimated by management, additional write-downs may be required. We recorded an impairment charge relating to our operating lease right-of-use assets of $1.6 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. There were no material impairment charges recorded for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nAllowances for Accounts and Finance Receivables. We maintain lifetime expected loss allowances for accounts and finance receivables based on historical experience of payment performance, current conditions of the customer, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts of collectability for the assets entire expected life, which is generally less than one year for accounts receivable and five years for finance receivables. Historical loss experience is utilized as there have been no significant changes in the mix or risk characteristics of the receivable revenue streams used to calculate historical loss rates. Current conditions are analyzed at each measurement date to reassess whether our receivables continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics as the prior measurement date, and determine if the reserve calculation needs to be adjusted for new developments, such as a customers inability to meet its financial obligations. Reasonable and supportable macroeconomic trends also are incorporated into the analysis. Estimating the allowances therefore requires us to apply judgment in relying on historical customer payment experience, regularly analyzing the financial condition of our customers, and developing macroeconomic forecasts to adequately cover expected credit losses on our receivables. By nature, such estimates are highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of receivables that we are unable to collect may be different than the amounts initially estimated in the allowances.\nInventories. We determine the value of inventories using the lower of cost or net realizable value. We write down inventories for the difference between the carrying value of the inventories and their net realizable value. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required.\nWe estimate our reserves for inventory obsolescence by continuously examining our inventories to determine if there are indicators that carrying values exceed net realizable values. Experience has shown that significant indicators that could require the need for additional inventory write-downs are the age of the inventory, the length of its product life cycles, anticipated demand for our products, changes to technical standards required by payment companies or by law, and current economic conditions. While we believe that adequate write-downs for inventory obsolescence have been made in the consolidated financial statements, actual demand could be less than forecasted demand for our products and we could experience additional inventory write-downs in the future.\nLoss Contingencies. Loss contingencies are uncertain and unresolved matters that arise in the ordinary course of business and result from events or actions by others that have the potential to result in a future loss. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, litigation.\nWhen a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. Moreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss.\nDisclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or when it is reasonably possible that the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review all contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. As discussed above, development of a meaningful estimate of loss or a range of potential loss is complex when the outcome is directly dependent on negotiations with or decisions by third parties, such as regulatory agencies, the court system and other interested parties. Such factors bear directly on whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of potential loss and boundaries of high and low estimates.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. The carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of our income tax accounting policies in accordance with applicable accounting standards and are based on managements assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income, as well as managements judgment regarding the interpretation of the provisions of applicable accounting standards. The carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on managements interpretations of applicable tax laws and incorporate managements assumptions and judgments regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of these deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income inherently rely heavily on estimates. We use our historical experience and our short and long-term business forecasts to provide insight. To the extent we do not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Federal and state net operating loss carryforwards are reserved with a full valuation allowance because, based on the available evidence, we believe it is more likely than not that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future. If the actual amounts of taxable income differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.\nSales tax reserve. The Company has recorded a contingent liability for sales tax, included in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues interest on the unpaid balance. The estimated liability is adjusted upon the payment of sales tax related to the accrual, the changes in state tax laws that may impact the accrual and the expiration of the statute of limitations for open years under review. The liability includes significant judgments and estimates that may change in the future, and the actual liability may be different from our current estimate. Changes to the sales tax reserve amount are recorded within general and administrative expenses and interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table shows certain financial and non-financial data that management believes give readers insight into certain trends and relationships about the Companys financial performance. We believe the metrics (Active Devices, Active Customers, Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions) are useful in allowing management and readers to evaluate our strategy of driving growth in devices and transactions.\nActive Devices\nActive Devices are devices that have communicated with us or have had a transaction in the last twelve months. Included in the number of Active Devices are devices that communicate through other devices that communicate or transact with us. A self-service retail location that utilizes an ePort cashless payment device as well as Seed management services constitutes only one device.\nActive Customers\nThe Company defines Active Customers as all customers with at least one active device.\nTotal Number Of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions\nTransactions are defined as electronic payment transactions that are processed by our technology-enabled solutions. Management uses Total Number of Transactions and Total Dollar Volume of Transactions to monitor recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of our new customer strategy and ability to leverage existing customers and partners.\nAs of and for the years ended\nJune 30, 2022 June 30, 2021 June 30, 2020\nDevices:\nActive Devices (thousands) 1,137 1,094 1,079\nCustomers:\nActive Customers 23,991 19,834 17,249\nVolumes:\nTotal Number of Transactions (millions) 1,052.8 868.7 881.1\nTotal Dollar Volume of Transactions (millions) 2,286.7 1,756.6 1,729.4\nHighlights for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 include:\n1.14 million Active Devices as of June 30, 2022 compared to 1.09 million as of June 30, 2021, an increase of approximately 43 thousand Active Devices, or 4.0%;\n23,991 Active Customers to our service as of June 30, 2022 compared to 19,834 as of June 30, 2021, an increase of 4,157 Active Customers, or 21%.\n2.3 billion in dollar volume of transactions for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to 1.8 billion for the year ended June 30, 2021, an increase of $0.53 billion, or 30%.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nThe following tables and charts summarize our results of operations and significant changes in our financial performance for the periods presented:\nRevenues and Gross Profit\nYear Ended June 30, Percent Change\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 2022 v. 2021 2021 v. 2020\nRevenues:\nSubscription and transaction fees $ 168,850 $ 139,242 $ 133,167 21.3 % 4.6 %\nEquipment sales 36,352 27,697 29,986 31.2 % (7.6) %\nTotal revenue 205,202 166,939 163,153 22.9 % 2.3 %\nCosts of sales:\nCost of subscription and transaction fees 103,392 83,617 82,980 23.6 % 0.8 %\nCost of equipment sales 37,615 29,296 33,900 28.4 % (13.6) %\nTotal costs of sales 141,007 112,913 116,880 24.9 % (3.4) %\nGross profit:\nSubscription and transaction fees 65,458 55,625 50,187 17.7 % 10.8 %\nEquipment sales (1,263) (1,599) (3,914) 21.0 % 59.1 %\nTotal gross profit $ 64,195 $ 54,026 $ 46,273 18.8 % 16.8 %\nGross margin:\nSubscription and transaction fees 38.8 % 39.9 % 37.7 %\nEquipment sales (3.5) % (5.8) % (13.1) %\nTotal gross margin 31.3 % 32.4 % 28.4 %\nRevenues\nTotal revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $205.2 million, consisting of $168.9 million of subscriptions and transactions fees and $36.4 million of equipment sales, compared to $166.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2021, consisting of $139.2 million of subscription and transaction fees and $27.7 million of equipment sales. The $38.3 million increase in total revenue from the prior year was attributable to a $29.6 million increase in subscription and transaction fees and a $8.7 million increase in equipment sales. The increase in subscription and transaction fees is primarily driven by increased processing volumes, with an approximately 30% increase in total dollar volumes for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the prior year. We are currently exceeding pre-pandemic (COVID-19) levels of processing volumes. We continue to benefit from a broader macroeconomic recovery across the United States as businesses, schools and other organizations across the country continue to maintain normal levels of operations. Increase in revenues is also attributed to continued focus of management to grow our recurring services to our customer base and a 4% in the Active Devices count compared to last year.\nThe increase in equipment sales relates to more equipment shipments in the current year compared to last year driven by continued upgrades by our customers from 3G to 4G network compatible devices and customers upgrading their hardware devices to the latest payment technology security standards. We expect equipment revenue to continue to be a significant contributor to our total revenues through the 3G network discontinuation date in North America through the end of the 2022 calendar year.\nCosts of sales\nCosts of sales increased $28.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase in costs of sales is attributed to a $19.8 million and $8.3 million increase in subscription and transaction costs and equipment costs respectively. The increase in cost of subscription and transaction fees was primarily driven by an corresponding increase in transaction processing fees. Similarly, the increase in the cost of equipment sales was driven by an increase in the volume of equipment sold during the current fiscal year.\nGross Margin\nTotal gross margin decreased from 32.4% for year ended June 30, 2021 compared to 31.3% for the year ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of a change in revenue mix with a higher percent of our total revenue being transaction fees, which is inherently a lower margin revenue stream. We were able to offset a portion of this decrease with an increase in our transaction fees margin by lowering costs for our payment processor and payment networks. Additionally, we have seen an increase in average price per transaction relative to the same period in the prior year, which is additive to our gross margin.\nLastly we did improve the gross margin on equipment sales driven by the rollout of the ePort Engage devices which are priced to have higher margins relative to the equipment sales last year.\nOperating Expenses\nYear ended June 30, Percent Change\nCategory ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 2022 v. 2021 2021 v. 2020\nSales and marketing $ 8,908 $ 6,935 $ 6,571 28.4 % 5.5 %\nTechnology and product development 21,877 15,935 15,094 37.3 % 5.6 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 30,519 35,754 40,083 (14.6 %) (10.8 %)\nInvestigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses 1,196 - 19,810 100 % (100 %)\nDepreciation and amortization 4,352 4,107 4,307 6.0 % (4.6 %)\nTotal operating expenses $ 66,852 $ 62,731 $ 85,865 6.6 % (26.9 %)\nTotal operating expenses. Operating expenses increased by $4.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The change is primarily attributed to a $5.9 million increase in technology and product development expenses, a $2.0 million increase in sales and marketing costs and a $1.2 million increase in investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses offset by a decrease of $5.2 million in general and administrative expenses. Outside of the non-recurring investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses; the change in total operating expenses reflects the Company's overall objectives to reduce general and administrative expenses and utilize savings to invest in innovative technologies and products and increase marketing spend to penetrate new and existing customers with our products and services. See further details within individual categories below.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased approximately $2.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The change is primarily attributed to an increase of approximately $1.4 million in advertising and trade show costs. The increase in trade show costs was due to our participation in industry conventions throughout FY22, along with launching our first Cantaloupe Innovation Summit in August 2022. These events were leveraged to drive increased sales and customer retention, while showcasing the latest innovations for self-service operators. Additional spending went into lead generation activities tied to advertising in trade publications, search, and retargeting campaigns to drive increased small- and medium-business (SMB) opportunities. The increase in expenses is also attributed to a $0.4 million increase in sales and marketing employee compensation expense which comprised of headcount increases and additional sales commissions costs incurred in the current year. The increased compensation expense supports our expanding business and service offerings in the United States and internationally.\nTechnology and product development. Technology and product development expenses increased approximately $5.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The increase was driven primarily by the Company's objectives of investing in innovative technologies, specifically advancing mobile enhancements across the Seed platform (including Seed Warehouse App, Seed Driver App) and the mobile loyalty platform for consumers. Other innovations include continuous improvements and machine acceptance of remote price change, integration with HIVERY Enhance for leveraging artificial intelligence/machine learning technology and new ePort hardware devices that were launched during the year. Additional expenses in technology were incurred to further strengthen our network environment and platform by preparing and transitioning to Amazon Web Services (completed in July 2022), which will provide our customers greater stability, reliability, and overall higher performance on processing transactions and transmitting data.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased approximately $5.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the year ended June 30, 2021. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a $5.4 million decrease in professional fees due to reduced reliance on external consultants who previously supported the Companys accounting, financial reporting and legal functions, a $1.6 million change relating to the network incident in the prior year, a $1.6 million lease impairment charge in the prior year, a $1.9 million decrease in stock\ncompensation, partially offset by a $0.9 million increase in salary and bonuses, an increase in bad debt expense of approximately $2.1 million, a $0.9 million change in sales tax reserve and an increase in travel and expense costs of $0.6 million during the current year.\nInvestigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses. In fiscal year 2019, the Audit Committee, with the assistance of independent legal and forensic accounting advisors, conducted an internal investigation of then-current and prior period matters relating to certain of the Companys contractual arrangements, including the accounting treatment, financial reporting and internal controls related to such arrangements. Additionally, in fiscal year 2019, significant financial reporting issues were identified which were unrelated to the internal investigation and which resulted in further adjustments to the Companys previously issued or prior fiscal years unissued financial statements. As a result of the findings, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year 2017 and our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarterly periods ended September 30, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, December 31, 2017, and March 31, 2018.\nInvestigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses were incurred primarily in fiscal year 2020 and 2019 in connection with the 2019 Investigation and the restatements of previously filed financial statements, bank consents, the remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting, the proxy solicitation, and professional services fees to assist with accounting and compliance activities in fiscal year 2020 following the filing of the 2019 Form 10-K.\nThe Company did not incur any material investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the Company and former officers incurred additional legal charges primarily relating to responding to inquiries from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in regards to the 2019 Investigation. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information on the above mentioned matters.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was predominantly consistent for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.\nOther income (expense), Net\nYear ended June 30, Percent Change\nCategory ($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020 2022 v. 2021 2021 v. 2020\nOther income (expense):\nInterest income $ 1,884 $ 1,159 $ 1,595 62.6 % (27.3 %)\nInterest expense $ (524) $ (4,013) $ (2,597) (86.9 %) 54.5 %\nOther income (expense) (220) 3,224 - 100.0 % NM\nTotal other income (expense), net $ 1,140 $ 370 $ (1,002) 208.1 % (136.9 %)\n____________\nNM - not meaningful\nOther income (expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 was $1.1 million, compared to $0.4 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The $0.7 million increase in Other income (expense), net from the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to a $0.7 million increase in interest income, a $3.5 million decrease in Interest expense offset by a $(3.4) million decrease in Other income.\nInterest income. The increase in interest income is primarily driven by a larger finance receivables amount on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022 compared to June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020.\nInterest expense. The higher interest expense for the for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily related to the recognition of the remaining balance of unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discount associated with the senior secured term loan facility with Antara Capital Master Fund LP of $2.6 million into interest expense, when the Antara Term Facility was fully repaid and terminated. The remaining reduction in interest expense was mainly due to a $0.8 million change in the interest component of the sales tax reserve in fiscal year 2022 compared to the fiscal year 2021. The change in the sales tax reserve was driven by the expiration of statute of limitations and other factors considered by management while establishing the reserve.\nOther income (expense): The higher other income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily attributed to Company receiving notification from the Small Business Administration that the $3.1 million Paycheck Protection Program loan and related accrued interest were forgiven in full. The Company recorded the forgiveness as a gain on debt extinguishment in our consolidated financial statements resulting in the increase in Other Income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures - Adjusted EBITDA\n\"Adjusted EBITDA (as defined is a non-GAAP financial measure which is not required by or defined under GAAP. We use this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision-making purposes and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful information about our operating results, enhances the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allows for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision making. The presentation of this financial measure is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial measures prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, including our net income or net loss or net cash used in operating activities. Management recognizes that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the items associated with our net income or net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP, and are not a substitute for or a measure of our profitability or net earnings. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it is useful to investors as a measure of comparative operating performance. Additionally, we utilize Adjusted EBITDA as a metric in our executive officer and management incentive compensation plans.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as U.S. GAAP net loss before (i) interest income (ii) interest expense on debt and reserves (iii) income tax expense (iv) depreciation (v) amortization (vi) stock-based compensation expense (vii) fees and charges that were incurred in connection with the 2019 Investigation and financial statement restatement activities as well as proxy solicitation costs that are not indicative of our core operations and (viii) certain other significant infrequent or unusual losses and gains that are not indicative of our core operations including asset impairment charges and gain on extinguishment of debt.\nBelow is a reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nNet loss $ (1,703) $ (8,705) $ (40,595)\nLess: interest income (1,884) (1,159) (1,595)\nPlus: interest expense 524 4,013 2,597\nPlus: income tax provision 186 370 1\nPlus: depreciation expense included in cost of sales for rentals 973 1,404 2,711\nPlus: depreciation and amortization expense in operating expenses 4,352 4,107 4,307\nEBITDA 2,448 30 (32,574)\nPlus: stock-based compensation (a)\n6,248 9,075 3,029\nPlus: investigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses (b)\n1,196 - 19,810\nPlus: asset impairment charge (c)\n- 1,578 -\nLess: gain on extinguishment of debt (d)\n- (3,065) -\nAdjustments to EBITDA 7,444 7,588 22,839\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 9,892 $ 7,618 $ (9,735)\n(a) As an adjustment to EBITDA, we have excluded stock-based compensation, as it does not reflect our cash-based operations.\n(b) As an adjustment to EBITDA, we have excluded the fees incurred in connection with the costs and expenses related to the 2019 Investigation, financial statement restatement activities, and proxy solicitation costs because we believe that they represent charges that are not related to our core operations.\n(c) As an adjustment to EBITDA, we have excluded the non-cash impairment charges related to long-lived operating lease right-of-use assets because we believe that these do not represent charges that are related to our core operations.\n(d) As an adjustment to EBITDA, we have excluded the one-time gain related to the forgiveness of our PPP loan.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through cash from operating activities, debt financings, and equity issuances. The Company has the following primary sources of capital available: (1) cash and cash equivalents on hand of $68.1 million as of June 30, 2022; (2) the cash that may be provided by operating activities; and (3) up to $15 million available to be drawn on the Amended Revolving Facility (defined below) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (4) up to an additional $10 million available through March 2023 to be drawn on the Amended Secured Term Facility (defined below) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolving Facility) and a $25 million secured term facility (the Amended Secured Term Facility and together with the Amended Revolving Facility, the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility), and fully replaces our previous 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility. For additional discussion on the amended credit facility see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe Company also has estimated and recorded for potential sales tax and related interest and penalty liabilities of $14.7 million in the aggregate as of June 30, 2022. The Company continues to evaluate these liabilities and the amount and timing of any such payments.\nThe Company believes that its current financial resources will be sufficient to fund its current twelve-month operating budget from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.\nBelow are charts that reflect our cash liquidity and outstanding debt for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nCash Flows\nSee Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 8 of this Annual Report for details on the changes in cash and cash equivalents classified by operating, investing and financing activities during our respective reporting periods.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities\nCash used in operating activities was $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $8.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. The $8.7 million cash used in operating activities reflects our net loss of $1.7 million, $22.5 million utilized by changes in working capital accounts offset by $15.5 million in non-cash operating charges.\nCash utilized by working capital accounts of approximately $22 million was principally a function of a $14.1 million increase in inventory, $13.6 million increase in accounts receivable, $4.3 million increase in prepaids and other assets, offset by an increase of $12.2 million to accounts payable and accrued expenses. Increase in inventory is driven by increased equipment sales as well as strategic planning to mitigate potential supply chain disruptions. The Company has increased inventory on hand in order to efficiently fulfill orders as they are placed and as we anticipate orders for customers who are continuing to upgrade 3G devices to 4G as the 3G network sunset date approaches near the end of calendar year 2022. Increase in cash utilized by accounts receivable of was as a result of increased sales and processing volumes during fiscal year 2022; offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses which was comprised of funds owed to customers as a result of larger processing volumes in fiscal year 2022.\nNon-cash operating charges primarily consisted of stock-based compensation, depreciation of property and equipment, and amortization of our intangible assets.\nNet cash used in investing activities\nCash used in investing activities was $12.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to cash used of $1.8 million in the same period in the prior year. Increase in cash used is due to the cash paid for the Yoke acquisition of $3 million and $9.3 million for increased property and equipment balances driven primarily by the Company's continued focus on investing in innovative technologies and products.\nCash used in investing activities was $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2021 which was primarily used to increase property and equipment.\nNet cash provided by financing activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2022 compared to cash provided of $50.1 million in the prior year. During the prior fiscal year, the Company raised $52.4 million of proceeds (net of issuance costs) through a private placement transaction with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 5,730,000 shares of the Companys common stock to accredited investors (described below). The Company paid $1.2 million as a prepayment penalty and commitment termination fee to Antara as part of the repayment of the 2020 Antara Term Facility and paid $0.5 million of debt issuance costs as a result of entering into the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had certain contractual obligations due over a period of time as summarized in the following table:\nPayments Due by Fiscal Year\n($ in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years\nDebt and financing obligations (a)\n$ 17,789 $ 809 $ 2,436 $ 14,544 $ -\nOperating lease obligations (b)\n4,387 1,758 1,736 893 -\nPurchase obligations (c)\n21,450 12,200 9,250 - -\nTotal contractual obligations $ 43,626 $ 14,767 $ 13,422 $ 15,437 $ -\n(a) Our debt and financing obligations include both principal and interest obligations. As of June 30, 2022, an interest rate of 5% was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligations for interest on the Amended JPMorgan Credit Agreement. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(b) Operating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of June 30, 2022. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(c) Purchase obligations primarily represent firm commitments to purchase inventory. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nAs of June 30, 2022 we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our outstanding borrowings. On March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolving Facility) and a $25 million secured term facility (the Amended Secured Term Facility and together with the Amended Revolving Facility, the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility), and fully replaces our previous 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility. The Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility has a four year maturity. Interest on the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility will be based, at the Companys option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Companys total leverage ratio and having ranges of between 2.50% and 3.00% for base rate loans and between 3.50% and 4.00% for SOFR loans; provided that until June 30, 2022 the applicable margin shall be 2.75% for base rate loans and 3.75% for SOFR loans. An increase of 100 basis points in SOFR Rate would not have a material impact on our interest expense or consolidated financial statements.\nWe are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our cash investments. We invest our excess cash in money market funds that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term. These investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes. Consequently, our exposure to market risks for interest rate changes related to our money market funds is not material. Market risks related to fluctuations of foreign currencies are not material and we have no freestanding derivative instruments as of June 30, 2022. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nCANTALOUPE, INC.\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (BDO USA, LLP; Richmond, VA; PCAOB ID#243)\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCantaloupe, Inc.\nMalvern, Pennsylvania\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Cantaloupe, Inc. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated October 19, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Identification of Performance Obligations\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized consolidated revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $205 million. The Company sells or leases point-of-sale devices (hardware) and provides an end-to-end payment solution, which integrates hardware, software, and payment processing in the unattended retail market. The Companys contracts with customers may have multiple performance obligations, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions about the nature and extent of those performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer, which maybe at a point in time, or over time.\nWe identified revenue recognition, specifically related to managements identification of the performance obligations within its customer contracts, as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination included the volume of the Companys contracts and variability within those contracts that may contain multiple products and services, together with the\nsignificant judgment involved in managements identification of performance obligations. Auditing these elements was especially challenging due to the extent of audit effort and the degree of auditor judgment required to address these matters.\nThe primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:\nTesting a sample of revenue contracts by obtaining and evaluating underlying source documents relevant to revenue recognition. For those selected contracts, evaluating managements identification of the performance obligations, including consideration of terms and conditions that may give rise to a material right.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2019.\nRichmond, Virginia\nOctober 19, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nShareholders and Board of Directors\nCantaloupe, Inc.\nMalvern, Pennsylvania\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cantaloupe, Inc.s (the Companys) internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company did not maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on managements statements referring to any corrective actions taken by the Company after the date of managements assessment.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements) and our report dated October 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Material weaknesses related to managements failure to design and maintain effective controls over financial reporting, specifically related to (1) entity-level controls impacting the control environment, risk assessment procedures, and monitoring activities to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements, including insufficient identification and assessment of risks impacting the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and insufficient evaluation and determination as to whether the components of internal control were present and functioning based upon evidence maintained for activity level controls, including management review controls, across substantially all of the Companys financial statement areas; (2) effective information technology controls related to user access, program change management, and segregation of duties for systems supporting the Companys accounting and reporting processes, and controls necessary to validate the completeness and accuracy of key reports used within activity level controls across substantially all financial statement areas; and (3) controls over recorded revenue and related accounts, including controls over the appropriate identification of performance obligations within customer contracts, allocation of transaction price to those performance obligations, identification of transactions requiring gross presentation, input of executed contract terms into the Company's information systems that perform revenue recognition, including the completeness and accuracy for reports used in the operation of controls over revenue recognition.\nThese material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2022 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated October 19, 2022 on those financial statements.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ BDO USA, LLP\nRichmond, Virginia\nOctober 19, 2022\nCantaloupe, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nAs of June 30,\n($ in thousands, except share data) 2022 2021\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 68,125 $ 88,136\nAccounts receivable, net 37,695 27,470\nFinance receivables, net 6,721 7,967\nInventory, net 19,754 5,292\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,285 2,414\nTotal current assets 136,580 131,279\nNon-current assets:\nFinance receivables due after one year, net 14,727 11,632\nProperty and equipment, net 12,784 5,570\nOperating lease assets 2,370 3,049\nIntangibles, net 17,947 19,992\nGoodwill 66,656 63,945\nOther assets 4,568 2,205\nTotal non-current assets 119,052 106,393\nTotal assets $ 255,632 $ 237,672\nLiabilities, convertible preferred stock and shareholders equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 48,440 $ 36,775\nAccrued expenses 28,154 26,460\nCurrent obligations under long-term debt 692 675\nDeferred revenue 1,893 1,763\nTotal current liabilities 79,179 65,673\nLong-term liabilities:\nDeferred income taxes 186 179\nLong-term debt, less current portion 13,930 13,644\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 2,366 3,645\nTotal long-term liabilities 16,482 17,468\nTotal liabilities $ 95,661 $ 83,141\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 18)\nConvertible preferred stock:\nSeries A convertible preferred stock, 900,000 shares authorized, 445,063 issued and outstanding, with liquidation preferences of $22,115 and $21,447 at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n3,138 3,138\nShareholders equity:\nPreferred stock, no par value, 1,800,000 shares authorized\n- -\nCommon stock, no par value, 640,000,000 shares authorized, 71,188,053 and 71,258,047 shares issued and outstanding at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively\n469,918 462,775\nAccumulated deficit (313,085) (311,382)\nTotal shareholders equity 156,833 151,393\nTotal liabilities, convertible preferred stock and shareholders equity $ 255,632 $ 237,672\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nCantaloupe, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands, except shares and per share data) 2022 2021 2020\nRevenues:\nSubscription and transaction fees $ 168,850 $ 139,242 $ 133,167\nEquipment sales 36,352 27,697 29,986\nTotal revenues 205,202 166,939 163,153\nCosts of sales:\nCost of subscription and transaction fees 103,392 83,617 82,980\nCost of equipment sales 37,615 29,296 33,900\nTotal costs of sales 141,007 112,913 116,880\nGross profit 64,195 54,026 46,273\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 8,908 6,935 6,571\nTechnology and product development 21,877 15,935 15,094\nGeneral and administrative 30,519 35,754 40,083\nInvestigation, proxy solicitation and restatement expenses 1,196 -

BUSINESS\nCantaloupe, Inc., previously known as USA Technologies, Inc., is organized under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We are a digital payments and software services company that provides end-to-end technology solutions for the unattended retail market. We are transforming the unattended retail world by offering a single platform for self-service commerce which includes integrated payments processing and software solutions that handle inventory management, pre-kitting, route logistics, warehouse and back-office management. Our enterprise-wide platform is designed to increase consumer engagement and sales revenue through digital payments, digital advertising and customer loyalty programs, while providing retailers with control and visibility over their operations and inventory. As a result, customers ranging from vending machine companies to operators of micro-markets, car wash, electric vehicle charging stations, commercial laundry, kiosks, amusements and more, can run their businesses more proactively, predictably, and competitively.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe Company, its employees, and its customers operate in geographic locations in which its business operations and financial performance continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While businesses, schools and other organizations re-open, which has led to increased foot-traffic to distributed assets containing our electronic payment solutions, the emergence of new strains and variants and resurgence of the virus, such as the outbreak of the Omicron variant in early calendar year 2022, have and may in the future lead to additional shutdowns and closures that impact our operations and financial results. Such impacts to our financial statements have in the past included, and may in the future include the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets including operating lease assets, property and equipment and allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts and finance receivables. We have concluded that there are no material impairments as a result of our evaluation for the year ended June 30, 2022. Where applicable, we have incorporated judgments and estimates of the expected impact of COVID-19 in the preparation of the financial statements based on information currently available. These judgments and estimates may change, as new events develop and additional information is obtained, and are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known.\nWhile we are encouraged by our strong operating and financial results, we continue to monitor the evolving situation and follow guidance from federal, state and local public health authorities. Given the potential uncertainty of the situation, the Company cannot, at this time, reasonably estimate the longer-term repercussions of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n2. ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCONSOLIDATION\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\"). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, have been included.\nThe Company operates as one operating segment because its chief operating decision maker, who is the Chief Executive Officer, reviews its financial information on a consolidated basis for purposes of making decisions regarding allocating resources and assessing performance.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations: operating expenses presentation\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company revised its presentation of operating expenses within its Consolidated Statements of Operations by disaggregating the previously disclosed Selling, general, and administrative costs into Sales and marketing,\nTechnology and product development, and General and administrative costs. The updated presentation is intended to provide additional transparency to the readers of the financial statements and better align the Companys financial performance with how management views and monitors business operations and makes strategic decisions. Prior period amounts for fiscal year 2021 and 2020 have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.\nBelow is a brief description of the various categories within Operating expenses:\nSales and marketing: Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of our sales and marketing team personnel costs which include non-capitalized wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation, sales commissions, severance costs, benefits, and employer taxes. In addition, this category includes fees paid for advertising, trade shows and external consultants who assist in outreach initiatives designed to build brand awareness and showcase the value of our products and services to our opportunity markets.\nTechnology and product development: Technology and product development expenses consist primarily of our technology and product team personnel costs and fees paid to external consultants relating to innovating and maintaining our portfolio of products and services and strengthening our network environment and platform. These costs include but are not limited to engineering, platform and software development, fees for software licenses, contract labor and other technology and product related items.\nGeneral, and administrative: General and administrative expenses consist primarily of our customer support, business operations, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative personnel costs and fees paid to external consultants for these respective departments. In addition, this category includes rent and occupancy costs and other miscellaneous costs incurred in the course of operating the business.\nDepreciation and amortization: No changes made to the accounting policies or previously reported amounts included within the Companys June 30, 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K for this category. Depreciation expense on our property and equipment, excluding property and equipment used for rentals, and amortization expense on our intangible assets are included within the Depreciation and amortization caption in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe presentation changes described above did not impact total operating expenses, operating loss, net loss or net loss per common share.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations: updated caption\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company revised the previously reported revenue caption of License and transaction fees to Subscription and transaction fees within its Consolidated Statements of Operations to provide a more accurate description of the revenue stream and align with commonly used terminology by industry participants. No changes were made to the revenue recognition accounting policies or previously reported amounts included within the Companys June 30, 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis.\nEstimates, judgments, and assumptions in these consolidated financial statement include, but are not limited to, those related to revenue recognition, capitalization of internal-use software and cloud computing arrangements, evaluation of goodwill and long-lived assets impairment, allowances for accounts and finance receivables, inventory reserves, loss contingencies, income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and sales tax reserve.\nCASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS\nCash equivalents represent all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from time of purchase. Cash equivalents are comprised of money market funds. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts where accounts may exceed federally insured limits at times. The Company deems this credit risk not to be significant as cash is held at well-capitalized financial institutions in the U.S.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS\nAccounts receivable include amounts due to the Company for sales of equipment, other amounts due from customers, merchant service receivables, contract manufacturers, and unbilled amounts due from customers, net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments, including from a shortfall in the customer transaction fund flow from which the Company would normally collect amounts due. The provision for doubtful accounts relating to Accounts receivable balances is recorded within general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe allowance is calculated under an expected loss model. We estimate our allowance using an aging analysis of the receivables balances, primarily based on historical loss experience, as there have been no significant changes in the mix or risk characteristics of the receivable revenue streams used to calculate historical loss rates. We also take into consideration that receivables for monthly service fees that are collected as part of the flow of funds from our transaction processing service have a lower risk profile than receivables for equipment and service fees billed under the Companys standard payment terms of 30 to 60 days from invoice issuance, and adjust our aging analysis to incorporate those risk assessments. Accounts receivables are considered past due if the invoices are not collected based on the respective standard payment terms as agreed to with the customers.\nCurrent conditions are analyzed at each measurement date as we reassess whether our receivables continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics as the prior measurement date, and determine if the reserve calculation needs to be adjusted for new developments, such as a customers inability to meet its financial obligations. Lastly, we also factor reasonable and supportable economic expectations into our allowance estimate for the assets entire expected life.\nThe Company writes off receivable balances against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management determines the balance is uncollectible and the Company ceases collection efforts. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company experienced increased write-offs compared to the year ended June 30, 2021, as management determined collection of older aged accounts receivable balances was not probable. These older aged accounts receivables balances were predominantly reserved for already as part of the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts estimate.\nEstimating an allowance requires us to apply judgment in relying on historical customer payment experience, regularly analyzing the financial condition of our customers, and developing macroeconomic forecasts to adequately cover expected credit losses on our receivables. By nature, such estimates are highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivables that we are unable to collect may be different than the amounts initially estimated in the allowance.\nFINANCE RECEIVABLES\nThe Company offers extended payment terms to certain customers for equipment sales under its Quick Start Program. Agreements under the Quick Start Program are accounted for as sales-type leases. Accordingly, the discounted future minimum lease payments are classified as finance receivables in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance receivables or Quick Start leases are generally for a sixty month term. The Company recognizes a portion of the note or lease payments as interest income in the accompanying consolidated financial statements based on the effective interest rate method.\nFinance receivables are carried at their contractual amount net of allowance for doubtful accounts. On July 1, 2020, we adopted Topic 326. The effects of implementation of this standard is discussed below under \"Measurement of Credits Losses on Financial Instruments\". The provision for doubtful accounts relating to Finance receivables is recorded within general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe allowance is calculated under an expected loss model. We estimate our allowance utilizing historical experience of payment performance, current conditions of the customer, and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts of collectability for the assets entire expected life, which is generally a sixty month term for finance receivables. Historical loss experience is utilized as there have been no significant changes in the mix or risk characteristics of the receivable revenue streams used to calculate historical loss rates. Current conditions are analyzed at each measurement date to reassess whether our receivables continue to exhibit similar risk characteristics as the prior measurement date, and determine if the reserve calculation needs to be adjusted for new developments, such as a customers inability to meet its financial obligations. Finance receivables are charged off against the allowance for credit losses when management determines that the finance receivables are uncollectible and the Company ceases collection efforts.\nEstimating an allowance requires us to apply judgment in relying on historical customer payment experience, regularly analyzing the financial condition of our customers, and developing macroeconomic forecasts to adequately cover expected\ncredit losses on our receivables. By nature, such estimates are highly subjective, and it is possible that the amount of finance receivables that we are unable to collect may be different than the amounts initially estimated in the allowance.\nINVENTORY, NET\nInventory consists of finished goods. The company's inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method.\nThe Company establishes allowances for slow-moving inventory based upon quality considerations and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. The allowance is recorded within Cost of equipment sales in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. The inventory reserve was $2.5 million and $3.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment are recorded at either cost or, in the instance of an acquisition, the estimated fair value on the date of the acquisition, and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the respective lease term. Depreciation expense on our property and equipment, excluding property and equipment used for rentals, is included in Depreciation and amortization in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation expense on our property and equipment used for rentals is included in Cost of Subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additions and improvements that extend the estimated lives of the assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nGOODWILL\nThe Companys goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of the net assets purchased in acquisitions. Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is subject to periodic testing for impairment. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing either a qualitative or a quantitative goodwill impairment test. When we perform a qualitative assessment and determine the fair value more likely than not exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is necessary. When we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of our reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then goodwill is not considered impaired. An impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which, if any, the carrying value exceeds the reporting units fair value. However, the loss recognized cannot exceed the reporting units goodwill balance.\nThe quantitative impairment test process requires valuation of the reporting unit, which we determine using the income approach, the market approach or a combination of the two approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows derived from assumptions that include expected growth rates and revenues, projected expenses, discount rates, capital expenditures and income tax rates. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on the quoted stock price, recent equity transactions of our business, market transactions involving similar businesses and market comparables.\nThe Company has selected April 1 as its annual test date. The Company has concluded there has been no impairment of goodwill during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, or 2020. Subsequent to our annual impairment test, no indicators of impairment were identified.\nINTANGIBLE AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nThe Company's intangible assets include trademarks, non-compete agreements, brand, developed technology, customer relationships and tradenames and were acquired in a purchase business combination. The Company carries these intangibles at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which span between three and eighteen years, and are included in Depreciation and amortization\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThere were no indefinite-lived intangible assets at June 30, 2022 or 2021.\nThe Company reviews its finite-lived intangible and other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. If the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets exceeds its net realizable value, the asset will be written down to its fair value.\nThe Company has concluded that the carrying amount of intangible assets is recoverable as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company recorded an impairment charge relating to our right-of-use assets of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1- Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2- Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).\nLevel 3- Inputs are unobservable and reflect the Companys assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company develops these inputs based on the best information available.\nCONCENTRATION OF RISKS\nConcentration of revenue with customers subject the Company to operating risks. Approximately 14%, 16% and 16% of the Companys revenue for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were concentrated with one customer. The Companys customers are principally located in the United States.\nAccounts receivable from one single contract manufacturer represented 16% and 5% of accounts receivables, net of allowance, as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe revenue recognition guidance provides a single model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company recognizes revenue using a five-step model resulting in revenue being recognized as performance obligations within a contract have been satisfied. The steps within that model include: (i) identifying the existence of a contract with a customer; (ii) identifying the performance obligations within the contract; (iii) determining the contracts transaction price; (iv) allocating the transaction price to the contracts performance obligations; and, (v) recognizing revenue as the contracts performance obligations are satisfied. Judgment is required to apply the principles-based, five-step model for revenue recognition. Management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions about the Companys contracts with its customers, including, among others, the nature and extent of its performance obligations, its transaction price amounts and any allocations thereof, the events which constitute satisfaction of its performance obligations, and when control of any promised goods or services is transferred to its customers. The standard also requires certain incremental costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract to be deferred and amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer of goods or services to the customer.\nThe Company provides an end-to-end payment solution which integrates hardware, software, and payment processing in the unattended retail market. The Company has contractual agreements with customers that set forth the general terms and conditions of the relationship, including pricing of goods and services, payment terms and contract duration. Revenue is recognized when the obligation under the terms of the Companys contract with its customer is satisfied and is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services.\nThe Companys business model is to act as the Merchant of Record for its sellers. We provide cashless vending payment services in exchange for monthly service fees, in addition to collecting usage-based consideration for completed transactions. The contracts we enter into with third-party suppliers provide us with the right to access and direct their services when processing a transaction. The Company combines the services provided by third-party suppliers to enable customers to accept cashless payment transactions, indicating that it controls all inputs in directing their use to create the combined service. Additionally, the Company sells cashless payment devices (e.g., e-Ports, Seed), which are either directly sold or leased through the Company's QuickStart or Cantaloupe ONE programs.\nThe Company recognizes fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, when we are the Merchant of Record, we control the service of completing payments for our customers through the payment ecosystem. The fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. For certain transactions in which we act in the capacity as an agent, these transactions are recorded on a net basis. These are transactions in which we are not the Merchant of Record, and the customer is entering into a separate arrangement with a third party payment processor for the fulfillment of the payment service.\nCashless vending services represent a single performance obligation as the combination of the services provided gives the customer the ability to accept cashless payments. The Companys customers are contracting for integrated cashless services in connection with purchasing or leasing unattended point-of-sale devices. The activities when combined together are so integral to the customers ability to derive benefit from the service, that the activities are effectively inputs to a single promise to the customer. Certain services are distinct, but are not accounted for separately as the rights are coterminous, they are transferred concurrently and the outcome is the same as accounting for the services as individual performance obligations. The single performance obligation is determined to be a stand-ready obligation to process payments whenever a consumer intends to make a purchase at a point-of-sale device. As the Company is unable to predict the timing and quantity of transactions to be processed, the assessment of the nature of the performance obligation is focused on each time increment rather than the underlying activity. Therefore, cashless vending services are viewed to comprise a series of distinct days of service that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. As a result, the promise to stand ready is accounted for as a single performance obligation.\nRevenue related to cashless vending services is recognized over the period in which services are provided, with usage-based revenue recognized as transactions occur. Consideration for this service includes fixed fees for standing ready to process transactions, and generally also includes usage-based fees, priced as a percentage of transaction value and/or a specified fee per transaction processed. The total transaction price of usage-based services is determined to be variable consideration as it is based on unknown quantities of services to be performed over the contract term. The underlying variability is satisfied each day the service is performed and provided to the customer. Clients are billed for cashless vending services on a monthly basis and for transaction processing as transactions occur. Payment is due based on the Companys standard payment terms which is typically within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance.\nEquipment sales represent a separate performance obligation, the majority of which is satisfied at a point in time through outright sales or sales-type leases when the equipment is delivered to the customer. Revenues related to Cantaloupe ONE equipment are recognized over time as the customer obtains the right to use the equipment through an operating lease. Clients are billed for equipment sales on a monthly basis, with payment due based on the Companys standard payment terms which is typically within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance.\nThe Company will occasionally offer volume discounts, rebates or credits on certain contracts, which is considered variable consideration. The Company uses either the most-likely or estimated value method to estimate the amount of the consideration, based on what the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled to on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company will qualitatively assess if the variable consideration should be limited to prevent possible significant reversals of revenue in future reporting periods.\nThe Company assesses the goods and/or services promised in each customer contract and separately identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a distinct good or service. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract using relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors.\nThe Companys standard payment terms are payment is due within 30 to 60 days of invoice issuance. The Company uses the practical expedient and does not recognize a significant financing component for payment considerations of less than one year.\nWarranties\nThe Company offers standard warranties that provide the customer with assurance that its equipment will function in accordance with contract specifications. The Company's standard warranties are not sold separately, but are included with each customer purchase. Warranties are not considered separate performance obligations and, therefore, are estimated and recorded at the time of sale.\nAccounts Receivable and Contract Liabilities\nA contract with a customer creates legal rights and obligations. As the Company satisfies performance obligations under customer contracts, a right to unconditional consideration is recorded as an account receivable.\nContract liabilities represent consideration received from customers in excess of revenues recognized (i.e., deferred revenue). Contract liabilities are classified as current or noncurrent based on the nature of the underlying contractual rights and obligations.\nContract Costs\nThe Company incurs costs to obtain contracts with customers, primarily in the form of commissions to sales employees. The Company recognizes as an asset the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if it expects to recover these costs. The Company currently does not incur material costs to fulfill its obligations under a contract once it is obtained but before transferring goods or services to the customer. Contract costs are amortized on a systematic basis consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates. A straight-line or proportional amortization method is used depending upon which method best depicts the pattern of transfer of the goods or services to the customer. The Companys contracts frequently contain performance obligations satisfied at a point in time and overtime. In these instances, the Company amortizes the contract costs proportionally with the timing and pattern of revenue recognition. Amortization of costs to obtain a contract are included within sales and marketing expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition, these contract costs are evaluated for impairment by comparing, on a pooled basis, the expected future net cash flows from underlying customer relationships to the carrying amount of the capitalized contract costs.\nIn order to determine the appropriate amortization period for contract costs, the Company considers a number of factors, including expected early terminations, estimated terms of customer relationships, the useful lives of technology Cantaloupe uses to provide goods and services to its customers, whether future contract renewals are expected and if there is any incremental commission to be paid on a contract renewal. The Company amortizes these assets over the expected period of benefit. Costs to obtain a contract with an expected period of benefit of one year or less are expensed when incurred.\nRevenue from the sale of QuickStart lease of equipment is recognized when equipment is shipped to the customer. Transaction processing revenue is recognized upon the usage of the Companys cashless payment and control network. Subscription fees for access to the Companys devices and network services are recognized on a monthly basis. In all cases, revenue is only recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the price is fixed and determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company estimates an allowance for subscription and transaction fee refunds on a monthly basis.\nHardware is available to customers under the QuickStart program pursuant to which the customer would enter into a five-year non-cancelable lease with either the Company or a third-party leasing company for the devices. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract using relative standalone selling prices. The Company determines standalone selling prices based on the price at which a good or service is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through historic data, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by considering all reasonably available information, including market data, trends, as well as other company- or customer-specific factors. The QuickStart contracts qualify for sales type lease accounting. At lease inception, the Company recognizes revenue and creates a finance receivable in an amount that represents the present value of minimum lease payments. Accordingly, a portion of the lease payments are recognized as interest income. At the end of the lease period, the customer would have the option to purchase the device at its residual value. Any customer payments received in advance and prior to the Company satisfying any performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as revenue is recognized.\nEquipment Rental\nThe Company offers its customers a rental program for its hardware devices, Cantaloupe ONE platform. Cantaloupe ONE terms are 36 months rental agreements that transition to month-to-month agreements after the initial subscription commitment period. In accordance with ASC 842, Leases, the Company classifies the rental agreements as operating leases, with service fee revenue related to the leases included in subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs for the Cantaloupe ONE revenue, which consist of depreciation expense on the Cantaloupe ONE equipment, are included in cost of services in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Equipment utilized by the Cantaloupe ONE program is included in property and equipment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLEASES\nLessee Accounting\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has operating and finance leases for office space, warehouses and office equipment. Cantaloupes leases have lease terms of one year to eight years and some include options to extend and/or terminate the lease. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Companys sole discretion. When deemed reasonably certain of exercise, the renewal options are included in the determination of the lease term. The Companys lease agreements do not contain any material variable lease payments, material residual value guarantees or any material restrictive covenants.\nRight-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease Right-of-Use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of the lease based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is the collateralized rate of interest that we would pay to borrow over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments, based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Cantaloupe has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. The Company uses the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all leases as well as electing a policy exclusion permitting leases with an original lease term of less than one year to be excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nVariable lease payments that are not based on an index or that result from changes to an index subsequent to the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability are not included in the measurement of lease ROU assets or liabilities and instead are recognized in earnings in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nThe Company reviews its ROU assets for events or changes in circumstances that may indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the carrying amount of an ROU exceeds its net realizable value, the asset will be written down to its fair value. The Company recorded a right-of-use asset impairment charge relating to optimizing its corporate real estate footprint of $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2021. The Company did not recognize an impairment charge related to the right-of-use assets for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nLessor Accounting\nThe Company offers its customers financing for the lease of our POS electronic payment devices through our QuickStart program. We account for these transactions as sales-type leases. Our sales-type leases generally have a non-cancellable term of 60 months. Certain leases contain an end-of-term purchase option that is generally insignificant and is reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee. Leases that do not meet the criteria for sales-type lease accounting are accounted for as operating leases, typically our Cantaloupe ONE rental program. Cantaloupe ONE agreements are 36-month rental agreements that transition to month-to-month agreements after the initial subscription commitment period.\nThe Company also uses the practical expedient related to treating lease and non-lease components as a single component for those leases where the timing and pattern of transfer for the non-lease component and associated lease component are the same and the stand-alone lease component would be classified as an operating lease if accounted for separately. The combined component is then accounted for under Topic 606 or Topic 842 depending on the predominant characteristic of the combined component, which was Topic 606 for the Company's operating leases. All QuickStart leases are sales-type and do not qualify for the election.\nLessor consideration is allocated between lease components and the non-lease components using the requirements under Topic 606. Revenue from sales-type leases is recognized upon shipment to the customer and the interest portion is deferred and recognized as earned. The revenues related to the sales-type leases are included in Equipment sales in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and a portion of the lease payments as interest income. Revenue from operating leases is recognized ratably over the applicable service period with service fee revenue related to the leases included in Subscription and transaction fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSHIPPING AND HANDLING\nShipping and handling fees billed to our customers in connection with sales are recorded as revenue. The costs incurred for shipping and handling of our product are recorded as cost of equipment.\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred and primarily consist of personnel, contractors and product development costs. Research and development expenses, which are included within the technology and product development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, were approximately $3.5 million, $3.9 million and $3.8 million, for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Our research and development initiatives focus on adding features and functionality to our system solutions through the development and utilization of our processing and reporting network and new technology.\nCAPITALIZATION OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE AND CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENTS\nWe have significant expenditures associated with the technological maintenance and improvement of our network and technology offerings. These expenditures include both the cost of internal employees, who spend portions of their time on various technological projects, and the use of external temporary labor and consultants. Capitalization of internal-use software occurs when we have completed the preliminary project stage, management authorizes the project, management commits to funding the project, it is probable the project will be completed and the project will be used to perform the function intended. We are required to assess these expenditures and make a determination as to whether the costs should be expensed as incurred or are subject to capitalization. In making these determinations, we consider the stage of the development project, the probability of successful development and if the development is resulting in increased features and functionality. In addition, if we determine that a project qualifies for capitalization, the amount of capitalization is subject to various estimates, including the amount of time spent on the development work and the cost of internal employees and external consultants. Internal-use software is included within Property and equipment, net on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and is amortized over its estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 7 years.\nWe capitalize certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements) following the internal-use software capitalization criteria described above. Our cloud computing arrangements involve services we use to support internal corporate functions, our platforms and technology offerings. Capitalized costs relating to cloud computing arrangements are included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is typically 3 to 5 years.\nACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY AWARDS\nThe cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments related to employees and non-employees is based on the grant-date fair value of the award and allocated over the requisite service period of the award. When the requisite service period precedes the grant date, the Company begins recognizing compensation cost before a grant date is established.\nThese costs are recorded within operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation, claims, contingencies and other legal matters. The Companys management and its legal counsel assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company's management team evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys financial statements. If the assessment indicates a loss contingency is not probable, but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of the range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed. Loss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the nature of the guarantee would be disclosed. Expected legal costs associated with assessing or potentially settling a contingent liability are expensed as incurred.\nSALES TAX RESERVE\nThe Company has recorded a contingent liability for sales tax, included in accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. On a quarterly basis, the Company accrues interest on the unpaid balance. The estimated liability is adjusted upon the payment of sales tax related to the accrual, the changes in state tax laws that may impact the accrual and the expiration of the statute of limitations for open years under review. The liability includes significant judgments and estimates that may change in the future, and the actual liability may be different from our current estimate. Future changes to the sales tax reserve amount will be recorded within general and administrative expenses and interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome taxes are computed using the asset and liability method of accounting. Under the asset and liability method, a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards. The measurement of deferred income tax assets is adjusted by a valuation allowance, if necessary, to recognize future tax benefits only to the extent, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not such benefits will be realized.\nTax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions within general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions incurred during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were immaterial.\nThe Company files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The tax years ended June 30, 2017 through June 30, 2021 remain open to examination by taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject. While the statute of limitations has expired for years prior to the year ended June 30, 2017, changes in reported losses for those years are examinable by tax authorities to the extent that operating loss carryforwards from those prior years impact upon taxable income in current years. As of June 30, 2022, the Company did not have any income tax examinations in process.\nEARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shares by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) applicable to common shares by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period plus the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents unless the effects of such common stock equivalents are anti-dilutive. For the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no effect for common stock equivalents was considered in the calculation of diluted earnings (loss) per share because their effect was anti-dilutive.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nAccounting pronouncements adopted\nMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\nThe Company adopted \"Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\" (Topic 326) on July 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective approach through an adjustment to retained earnings, and began calculating our allowance for accounts and finance receivables under an expected loss model rather than an incurred loss model.\nThe following table represents the impact of adoption of Topic 326 and a roll forward of the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts and finance receivables for the years ending June 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands)\nAccounts Receivable\nFinance Receivable\nAccounts Receivable\nFinance Receivable\nBalance, beginning of period\n$ 7,715 $ 1,109 $ 8,777 $ 150\nImpact of adoption of Topic 326\n- - (757) 409\nProvision for expected losses\n3,435 36 686 550\nWrite-offs\n(1,822) (385) (991) -\nBalance, end of period\n$ 9,328 $ 760 $ 7,715 $ 1,109\nASU 2019-12 - Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company adopted ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The adoption of this accounting standard did not materially impact the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting pronouncements to be adopted\nThe Company is evaluating whether the effects of the following recent accounting pronouncements, or any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, will have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting and ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform: Scope, respectively. Together, the ASUs provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. These optional expedients and exceptions are effective beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and adoption is permitted at any time in the effective period. The Company is currently evaluating and assessing the impact these accounting standards will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and if it will elect these optional standards.\nLessor Classification\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments which requires lessors to classify leases as operating leases if they have variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate and would have selling losses if they were classified as sales-type or direct financing leases. ASU 2021-05 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022. The Company has evaluated the impact of this accounting standard and does not expect there to be a material effect at adoption to our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting for Debt and Equity Instruments\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity and improves and amends the related earnings per share (\"EPS\") guidance. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We plan to adopt this pronouncement for our fiscal year beginning July 1, 2022. The Company has evaluated the impact of this accounting standard and does not expect there to be a material effect at adoption to our consolidated financial statements.\n3.

REVENUE\nDisaggregated Revenue\nBeginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company disaggregated Subscription and transaction fees presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations to Transaction fees and Subscription fees categories (described below) as this additional disclosure provides greater visibility into the Company's revenue streams and better aligns the Companys financial performance including how management views and monitors business operations and makes strategic decisions.\nTransaction fees: The Company charges its customers a transaction fee generally calculated as a percentage rate on volumes processed through our payment devices.\nSubscription fees: Subscription fees are primarily comprised of the monthly service fee charged to our customers for our cashless payment services, service fees originated through our rental program and Seed software services that include inventory management, route logistics optimization, warehouse and accounting management, and responsive merchandising.\nBased on similar operational characteristics, the Company's revenue is disaggregated as follows:\nYear-ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nTransaction fees $ 110,695 $ 85,497 $ 81,244\nSubscription fees 58,155 53,745 51,923\nSubscription and transaction fees 168,850 139,242 133,167\nEquipment sales 36,352 27,697 29,986\nTotal revenues $ 205,202 $ 166,939 $ 163,153\nContract Liabilities\nThe Company's contract liability (i.e., deferred revenue) balances are as follows:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021\nDeferred revenue, beginning of the period $ 1,763 $ 1,698\nDeferred revenue, end of the period 1,893 1,763\nRevenue recognized in the period from amounts included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the period 383 595\nThe change in the contract liabilities year-over-year is primarily the result of timing difference between the Company's satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment from the customer.\nContract Costs\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had net capitalized costs to obtain contracts of $0.5 million included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $2.3 million included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. None of these capitalized contract costs were impaired. During the year ended June 30, 2022, amortization of capitalized contract costs was $0.7 million.\nAt June 30, 2021, the Company had net capitalized costs to obtain contracts of $0.4 million included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and $2.0 million included in Other noncurrent assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. None of these capitalized contract costs were impaired. During the year ended June 30, 2021, amortization of capitalized contract costs was $0.6 million.\nFuture Performance Obligations\nThe Company will recognize revenue in future periods related to remaining performance obligations for certain open contracts. Generally, these contracts have terms of one year or less. The amount of revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations in which the original duration of the contract is greater than one year is not significant.\n5. LOSS PER SHARE CALCULATION\nThe following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted loss per share:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands, except share and per share data) 2022 2021 2020\nNumerator for basic and diluted loss per share\nNet loss $ (1,703) $ (8,705) $ (40,595)\nPreferred dividends (668) (668) (668)\nNet loss available to common shareholders $ (2,371) $ (9,373) $ (41,263)\nDenominator for basic loss per share - Weighted average shares outstanding\n71,091,790 67,002,438 62,980,193\nEffect of dilutive potential common shares - - -\nDenominator for diluted loss per share - Adjusted weighted average shares outstanding\n71,091,790 67,002,438 62,980,193\nBasic and diluted loss per share $ (0.03) $ (0.14) $ (0.66)\nPotentially anti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share were approximately 5 million, 4 million, and 3 million for the year ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n6. ACQUISITION\nIn August 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of Delicious Nutritious LLC, doing business as Yoke Payments (Yoke), a micro market payments company. The acquisition of Yoke was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which includes the results of operations of the acquired business from the date of acquisition. The purchase price of the acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values using primarily Level 3 inputs under ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill.\nThrough the acquisition, Yokes point of sale platform will now extend its offering to provide self-checkout while seamlessly integrating with Cantaloupes inventory management and payment processing platforms. We plan to differentiate ourselves by providing a single platform to manage consumer and operational aspects of micro markets, while also integrating multiple service providers for flexibility and ultimate ease to our customers.\nThe consideration transferred for the acquisition includes payments of $3 million in cash at the close of the transaction and $1 million in deferred cash payment due on or before July 30, 2022 based on the achievement of certain sales growth targets. As of the date of the acquisition and as of the year ended June 30, 2022, we expected to pay the entire deferred cash payment and we accrued a contingent consideration liability of $1 million which is included within Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. On July 27, 2022, the Company made the cash payment of $1 million in accordance with the agreement consideration.\nAdditionally in connection with the acquisition, the Company will issue common stock to the former owners of Yoke based on the achievement of certain sales growth targets for software licenses through July 31, 2024 and continued employment as of the respective measurement dates. The accounting treatment for these awards in the context of the business combination is to recognize the awards as a post-combination expense and were not included in the purchase price. We will begin recognizing compensation expense for these awards over the requisite service period when it becomes probable that the performance condition would be satisfied. At each reporting date, we assess the probability of achieving the sales targets and fulfilling the performance condition. For the year ended June 30, 2022, we determined that it is not probable that the performance condition would be satisfied and, accordingly, have not recognized compensation expense related to these awards.\nThe following table summarizes the total consideration paid for Yoke, total net assets acquired, identifiable assets and goodwill recognized at the acquisition date:\n($ in thousands) Amount\nConsideration\nCash $ 2,966\nContingent consideration arrangement 1,000\nFair value of total consideration transferred 3,966\nRecognized amounts of identifiable assets\nTotal net assets acquired 21\nIdentifiable intangible assets 1,235\nTotal identifiable net assets 1,256\nGoodwill $ 2,710\nAmounts allocated to identifiable intangible assets included $0.9 million related to developed technology, $0.3 million related to customer relationships, and $0.1 million related to other intangible assets. The fair value of the acquired developed technology was determined using a multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the acquired customer relationships was determined using the with-and-without method which estimates the value using the cash flow impact in a scenario where the customer relationships are not in place. The recognized intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.\nGoodwill of $2.7 million arising from the acquisition includes the expected synergies between Yoke and the Company and intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition at the time of acquisition. The goodwill, which is deductible for income tax purposes, was assigned to the Companys only reporting unit.\nThe above table represents the final allocation of the purchase price, noting no material measurement period adjustments. Pro forma financial information of the acquisition is not presented due to the immaterial impact of the financial results of Yoke in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n7. FINANCE RECEIVABLES\nThe Companys finance receivables consist of financed devices under the QuickStart program and devices contractually associated with the Seed platform. Predominately all of the Companys finance receivables agreements are classified as non-cancellable sixty-month sales-type leases. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, finance receivables consist of the following:\nAs of June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021\nCurrent finance receivables, net $ 6,721 $ 7,967\nFinance receivables due after one year, net 14,727 11,632\nTotal finance receivables, net of allowance of $760 and $1,109, respectively\n$ 21,448 $ 19,599\nWe collect lease payments from customers primarily as part of the flow of funds from our transaction processing service. Balances are considered past due if customers do not have sufficient transaction revenue to cover the monthly lease payment by\nthe end of the monthly billing period. The Company routinely monitors customer payment performance and uses prior payment performance as a measure to assess the capability of the customer to repay contractual obligations of the lease agreements as scheduled. On an as-needed basis, qualitative information may be taken into consideration if new information arises related to the customers ability to repay the lease.\nCredit risk for these receivables is continuously monitored by management and reflected within the allowance for finance receivables by aggregating leases with similar risk characteristics into pools that are collectively assessed. Because the Companys lease contracts generally have similar terms, customer characteristics around transaction processing volume and sales were used to disaggregate the leases. Our key credit quality indicator is the amount of transaction revenue we process for each customer relative to their lease payment due, as we consider this customer characteristic to be the strongest predictor of the\nrisk of customer default. Customers with low processing volume or with transaction sales that are insufficient to cover the lease\npayment are considered to be at a higher risk of customer default.\nCustomers are pooled based on their ratio of gross sales to required monthly lease obligations. We categorize outstanding receivables into two categories: high ratio customers (customers who have adequate transaction processing volumes to cover monthly fees) and low ratio customers (customers that do not consistently have adequate transaction processing volumes to cover monthly fees). Using these two categories, we performed an analysis of historical write-offs to calculate reserve percentages by aging buckets for each category of customer.\nAt June 30, 2022, the gross lease receivable by current payment performance on a contractual basis and year of origination consisted of the following:\nLeases by Origination\n($ in thousands) Up to 1 Year Ago Between 1 and 2 Years Ago Between 2 and 3 Years Ago Between 3 and 4 Years Ago Between 4 and 5 Years Ago More than 5 Years Ago Total\nCurrent $ 7,451 $ 5,047 $ 2,758 $ 2,593 $ 2,807 $ 103 $ 20,759\n30 days and under 18 10 32 56 94 3 213\n31 - 60 days 25 23 26 58 100 - 232\n61 - 90 days 25 14 20 46 91 - 196\nGreater than 90 days 41 47 97 232 391 - 808\nTotal finance receivables $ 7,560 $ 5,141 $ 2,933 $ 2,985 $ 3,483 $ 106 $ 22,208\nAt June 30, 2021, the gross lease receivable by current payment performance on a contractual basis and year of origination\nconsisted of the following:\nLeases by Origination\n($ in thousands) Up to 1 Year Ago Between 1 and 2 Years Ago Between 2 and 3 Years Ago Between 3 and 4 Years Ago Between 4 and 5 Years Ago More than 5 Years Ago Total\nCurrent $ 6,736 $ 3,970 $ 3,942 $ 3,081 $ 1,358 $ 31 $ 19,118\n30 days and under 19 67 90 93 11 1 281\n31 - 60 days 4 9 22 2 1 - 38\n61 - 90 days 10 42 66 54 10 - 182\nGreater than 90 days 46 69 490 419 54 11 1,089\nTotal finance receivables $ 6,815 $ 4,157 $ 4,610 $ 3,649 $ 1,434 $ 43 $ 20,708\nAt June 30, 2022, credit quality indicators by year of origination consisted of the following:\nLeases by Origination\n($ in thousands) Up to 1 Year Ago Between 1 and 2 Years Ago Between 2 and 3 Years Ago Between 3 and 4 Years Ago Between 4 and 5 Years Ago More than 5 Years Ago Total\nHigh ratio customers $ 7,498 $ 4,853 $ 2,688 $ 2,623 $ 2,950 $ 102 $ 20,714\nLow ratio customers 62 288 245 362 533 4 1,494\nTotal finance receivables $ 7,560 $ 5,141 $ 2,933 $ 2,985 $ 3,483 $ 106 $ 22,208\nAt June 30, 2021, credit quality indicators by year of origination consisted of the following:\nLeases by Origination\n($ in thousands) Up to 1 Year Ago Between 1 and 2 Years Ago Between 2 and 3 Years Ago Between 3 and 4 Years Ago Between 4 and 5 Years Ago More than 5 Years Ago Total\nHigh ratio customers $ 6,415 $ 3,824 $ 3,793 $ 2,920 $ 1,290 $ 24 $ 18,266\nLow ratio customers 400 333 817 729 144 19 2,442\nTotal finance receivables $ 6,815 $ 4,157 $ 4,610 $ 3,649 $ 1,434 $ 43 $ 20,708\nThe following table represents a rollforward of the allowance for finance receivables for the year ending June 30, 2022 and 2021:\n($ in thousands) Year ended June 30, 2022 Year ended June 30, 2021\nBalance at June 30 $ 1,109 $ 150\nImpact of ASC 326* - 409\nProvision for expected losses 36 550\nWrite-offs (385) -\nBalance June 30 $ 760 $ 1,109\n* The Company adopted ASC 326 on July 1, 2020.\nCash to be collected on our performing finance receivables due for each of the fiscal years after June 30, 2022 are as follows:\n($ in thousands)\n2023 $ 2,937\n2024 1,841\n2025 3,420\n2026 6,039\n2027 9,368\nThereafter 1,384\nTotal amounts to be collected 24,989\nLess: interest (2,781)\nLess: allowance for doubtful accounts (760)\nTotal finance receivables $ 21,448\n8.

In the event of default, the interest rate may be increased by 2.00%. The 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility carries a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion. From August 14, 2020 through March 2, 2021, the applicable interest rate was Prime Rate plus 3.75%. On March 2, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment (the First Amendment) to the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility lowering the interest rate charged to the Company. In conjunction with the First Amendment, the Company elected to convert its loans to a Eurodollar borrowing which is subject to a LIBOR based interest rate.\nThe Companys obligations under the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility were secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the Company. The 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement included customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain an adjusted quick ratio of not less than 2.75 to 1.00 beginning January 1, 2021, and not less than 3.00 to 1.00 beginning April 1, 2021, and a financial covenant requiring the Company to maintain, as of the end of each of its fiscal quarters commencing with the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021, a total leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00.\nJP Morgan amended and restated Credit Agreement dated March 17, 2022\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which provides for a $15 million secured revolving credit facility (the Amended Revolving Facility) and a $25 million secured term facility (the Amended Secured Term Facility and together with the Amended Revolving Facility, the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility), and fully replaces our previous 2021 JPMorgan Credit Facility. The Amended Secured Term Facility includes a $10 million increase from the 2021 JPMorgan Secured Term Facility which is available for a period of up to twelve months following the Closing Date.\nThe proceeds of the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility may be used to refinance certain existing indebtedness of the Company and its subsidiaries, to finance the working capital needs, and for general corporate purposes (including permitted acquisitions), of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility has a four year maturity. Interest on the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility will be based, at the Companys option, on a base rate or SOFR plus an applicable margin tied to the Companys total leverage ratio and having ranges of between 2.50% and 3.00% for base rate loans and between 3.50% and 4.00% for SOFR loans; provided that until June 30, 2022 the applicable margin shall be 2.75% for base rate loans and 3.75% for SOFR loans. Subject to the occurrence of a material acquisition and the Companys total leverage ratio exceeding 3.00 to 1.00, the interest rate on the loans may increase by 0.25%. In an event of default, the interest rate may be increased by 2.00%. The Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility will also carry a commitment fee of 0.50% per annum on the unused portion. As of June 30, 2022, the total applicable interest rate for the Amended Secured Term Facility is 4.4%.\nThe Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility includes customary representations, warranties and covenants, and acceleration, indemnity and events of default provisions, including, among other things, two financial covenants. One financial covenant requires the Company to maintain, at all times, a total leverage ratio of not more than 3.00 to 1.00 on the last day of any fiscal quarter. The other financial covenant is conditional on a material acquisition occurring: if a material acquisition occurs, the Company is required to maintain a total leverage ratio not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 for the next four fiscal quarters following the material acquisition.\nThe Amended Secured Term Facility was accounted for as a modification of the 2021 JPMorgan Secured Term Facility. The previously unamortized debt issuance costs remain capitalized, the new fees paid to the creditor were capitalized, and allocated third-party costs incurred allocated to the term facility were charged to expense. We have also evaluated that the borrowing capacity of the Amended Revolving Facility is greater than the borrowing capacity of the 2021 JPMorgan Revolving Facility. The previously unamortized debt issuance costs remain capitalized, the new fees paid to the creditor and allocated third-party costs were capitalized. The Company capitalized $0.3 million of issuance costs related to the Amended JPMorgan Credit Facility during the year-ended June 30, 2022.\nThe Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of June 30, 2022.\nTerm Facility with Antara\nOn October 9, 2019, the Company entered into a commitment letter with Antara Capital Master Fund LP (Antara), pursuant to which Antara committed to extend to the Company a $30.0 million senior secured term loan facility (2020 Antara Term Facility). On October 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Financing Agreement with Antara to draw $15.0 million on the 2020 Antara Term Facility and agreed to draw an additional $15.0 million at any time between July 31, 2020 and April 30, 2021, subject to the terms of the Financing Agreement. The outstanding amount of the draws under the 2020 Antara Term Facility bore interest at 9.75% per annum, payable monthly in arrears. The proceeds of the initial draw were used to repay the outstanding balance of the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below) due to JPMorgan. in the amount of $10.1 million, including accrued interest, and to pay transaction expenses. The Company would also incur a prepayment premium of 5% of the principal balance if prepaid on or prior to December 31, 2020.\nOn October 9, 2019, the Company also sold shares of the Companys common stock to Antara at a price below market value. Since the 2020 Antara Term Facility and equity issuance were negotiated in contemplation of each other and executed within a short period of time, the Company evaluated the debt and equity financing as a combined arrangement, and estimated the fair values of the debt and equity components to allocate the proceeds, net of the registration rights agreement liability on a relative fair value basis between the debt and equity components. The non-lender fees incurred to establish the debt and equity financing arrangement were allocated to the debt and equity components on a relative fair value basis and capitalized on the Companys balance sheet of which $0.9 million was allocated to debt issuance costs and $0.1 million was allocated to debt commitment fees. The 2020 Antara Term Facility agreement also contained a mandatory prepayment feature that was determined to be an embedded derivative, requiring bifurcation and fair value recognition for the derivative liability. The allocation of the proceeds to the debt component and the bifurcation of the embedded derivative liability resulted in a $2.1 million debt discount, which was de-recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2020.\nOn August 14, 2020, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under the 2020 Antara Term Facility and entered into the 2021 JPMorgan Credit Agreement. The Company recorded a liability for the commitment termination fee and prepayment premium for $1.2 million as of June 30, 2020. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has no outstanding obligations related to the 2020 Antara Term Facility.\nOther Long-Term Borrowings\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we received loan proceeds of approximately $3.1 million (the PPP Loan) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). We used the PPP Loan in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act. The loan bore a fixed interest rate of 1% over a two-year term from the approval date of April 28, 2020. The application for these funds required the Company to, in good faith, certify that the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19 made the loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Company. This certification further required the Company to take into account our current business activity and our ability to access other sources of liquidity sufficient to support ongoing operations in a manner that is not significantly detrimental to the business. The receipt of these funds and the forgiveness of the loan is dependent on the Company having initially qualified for the loan and qualifying for the forgiveness of such loan based on our future adherence to the forgiveness criteria.\nOn June 8, 2021, the Company received notification from the Small Business Administration that they approved the forgiveness of the full $3.1 million PPP loan and related accrued interest. The Company recorded the forgiveness as a gain on debt extinguishment in Other income in our consolidated financial statements. The SBA reserves the right to audit any PPP loan, regardless of size. These audits may occur after forgiveness has been granted. Under the CARES Act, all borrowers are required to maintain their loan documentation for six years after the PPP loan was forgiven or repaid in full and to provide that documentation to the SBA upon request.\nThe expected maturities associated with the Companys outstanding debt and other financing arrangements as of June 30, 2022, were as follows:\n2023 770\n2024 897\n2025 1,250\n2026 11,966\n2027 -\nPrincipal amounts payable 14,883\nUnamortized issuance costs (261)\nTotal outstanding debt $ 14,622\n12. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, are carried at cost which approximates fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. We have not identified material impacts from COVID-19 on the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities. The Companys obligations under its long-term debt agreements are carried at amortized cost, which approximates their fair value as of June 30, 2022, as the debt facility was recently amended and expanded in March 2022 and the interest rates applicable are variable in nature. The fair value of the Companys obligations under its long-term debt agreements with JPMorgan were considered Level 2 liabilities of the fair value hierarchy because these instruments have interest rates that reset frequently.\n13. EQUITY\nPRIVATE PLACEMENTS\nOn February 24, 2021, the Company entered into separate subscription agreements in identical form and substance (the Subscription Agreements) with institutional accredited investors (the Purchasers) relating to a private placement (the Private Placement) with respect to the sale of an aggregate of 5,730,000 shares of the Companys common stock. The Private\nPlacement closed on March 4, 2021 and the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $55 million based on the offering price of $9.60 per share (the Purchase Price). The Company incurred $2.6 million in direct and incremental issuance costs relating to the Private Placement that were accounted as a reduction in the proceeds of the stock. The syndicate for the Private Placement included affiliates of Hudson Executive, a greater than 10% shareholder and a related party of the Company. Affiliates of Hudson Executive purchased 975,000 of the shares sold in the Private Placement for the same purchase price and on the same terms as the other purchasers.\nPursuant to the Subscription Agreements, the Company agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission covering the resale of the Shares within 45 days following the date of the Subscription Agreements and\nto cause the registration statement to become effective within 60 days following the filing deadline. On April 5, 2021, the Company filed the registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and, on April 14, 2021, the registration statement was declared effective.\nWARRANTS\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company had 23,978 warrants exercisable at $5 per share outstanding which were exercised and resulted in 12,154 shares issued pursuant to a cashless exercise option election made by the holder. As of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, the Company does not have any warrants outstanding.\n14. INCOME TAXES\nOn December 21, 2020, Congress approved the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the Appropriations Act), which was signed into law by the President on December 27, 2020. The Appropriations Act funds the federal government to the end of the fiscal year and provides further COVID-19 economic relief. Some of the business provisions included in the Appropriations Act are additional Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") loans, clarification of the deductibility of business expenses that were paid for with PPP funds, expansion of the employee retention credit, and temporary full deduction for business expenses for food and beverages provided by a restaurant. The Appropriations Act did not have a material impact on the Companys income taxes. The Company will continue to monitor for additional legislation related to COVID-19 and its impact on our results of operations.\nThe Company has significant deferred tax assets, a substantial amount of which result from operating loss carryforwards. The Company routinely evaluates its ability to realize the benefits of these assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that such benefit will be realized. In accordance with the history of losses generated, the Company believes that for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the Company re-established a full valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 is comprised of the following:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nCurrent:\nFederal $ - $ - $ 126\nState (179) (328) (57)\nTotal current (179) (328) 69\nDeferred:\nFederal (18) (12) (156)\nState 11 (30) 86\nTotal deferred (7) (42) (70)\nTotal income tax provision $ (186) $ (370) $ (1)\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 to the indicated provision based on income (loss) before the provision for income taxes at the federal statutory rate of 21.0% for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020 is as follows:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nIndicated benefit at federal statutory rate $ 319 $ 1,648 $ 8,514\nEffects of permanent differences\nStock compensation (184) 168 (226)\nOther permanent differences (106) 608 (106)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit (275) 116 1,393\nChanges related to prior years - - 489\nChanges in valuation allowances 184 (2,927) (10,139)\nOther (124) 17 74\nProvision for income taxes $ (186) $ (370) $ (1)\nAs of June 30, 2022 the Company had federal and state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $190 million and $222 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. As of June 30, 2021 the Company had federal and state operating loss carryforwards of approximately $187 million and $221 million, respectively, to offset future taxable income. The timing and extent to which the Company can utilize operating loss carryforwards in any year may be limited because of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code regarding changes in ownership of corporations (i.e. IRS Code Section 382). Federal and state operating loss carryforwards start to expire in 2022 and certain state operating loss carryforwards are currently expiring.\nThe net deferred tax assets arose primarily from net operating loss carryforwards, as well as the use of different accounting methods for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes as follows:\nAs of June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021\nDeferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carryforwards $ 47,984 $ 46,851\nAsset reserves 6,666 7,231\nDeferred research and development 1,503 1,420\nStock-based compensation 3,416 2,620\nOther (143) 2,135\n59,426 60,257\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nIntangibles (4,316) (4,956)\nDeferred tax assets, net 55,110 55,301\nValuation allowance (55,296) (55,480)\nDeferred tax liabilities $ (186) $ (179)\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had total unrecognized income tax benefits of $0.6 million related to its nexus in certain state tax jurisdictions. If recognized in future years, $0.6 million of these currently unrecognized income tax benefits would impact the income tax provision and effective tax rate. The following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized income tax benefits:\nYear ended June 30,\n($ in thousands) 2022 2021 2020\nBalance at the beginning of the year $ 444 $ 207 $ 210\nGross increases and decreases related to current period tax positions - - -\nGross increases and decreases related to prior period tax positions 128 237 (3)\nBalance at the end of the year $ 572 $ 444 $ 207\n15. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION PLANS\nThe Company has four active stock based compensation plans at June 30, 2022 as shown in the table below:\nDate Approved Name of Plan Type of Plan Authorized\nShares\nJune 2013 2013 Stock Incentive Plan Stock 500,000\nJune 2014 2014 Stock Option Incentive Plan Stock options 750,000\nJune 2015 2015 Equity Incentive Plan Stock & stock options 1,250,000\nApril 2018 2018 Equity Incentive Plan Stock & stock options 4,000,000\n6,500,000\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had reserved shares of Common Stock for future issuance for the following:\nCommon Stock Reserved Shares\nConversions of Preferred Stock and cumulative Preferred Stock dividends 106,141\nIssuance upon exercise of stock options granted to current CEO 1,000,000\nIssuance of shares to former CEO George Jensen upon the occurrence of a Cantaloupe transaction (1)\n140,000\nIssuance under 2014 Stock Option Incentive Plan 115,687\nIssuance under 2015 Equity Incentive Plan 392,159\nIssuance under 2018 Equity Incentive Plan 179,843\nTotal shares reserved for future issuance 1,933,830\n__________________________________________\n(1)Represents 140,000 shares issuable to our former CEO George Jensen upon the occurrence of a \"USA Transaction\" as such term is defined in the Jensen Stock Agreement dated September 27, 2011 by and between the Company and George R. Jensen.\nSTOCK OPTIONS\nStock options are granted at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the date of grant. The options typically vest over a three year period and each option, if not exercised or terminated, expires on the seventh anniversary of the grant date.\nThe Company estimates the grant date fair value of the stock options with service conditions (i.e., a condition that requires an employee to render services to the Company for a stated period of time to vest) it grants using a Black-Scholes valuation model. The Companys assumption for expected volatility is based on its historical volatility data related to market trading of its own common stock. The Company uses the simplified method to determine expected term, as the Company does not have adequate historical exercise and forfeiture behavior on which to base the expected life assumption. The dividend yield assumption is based on dividends expected to be paid over the expected life of the stock option. The risk-free interest rate assumption is determined by using the U.S. Treasury rates of the same period as the expected option term of each stock option.\nThe fair value of options granted during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was determined using the following assumptions:\nFor the year ended June 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nExpected volatility 73.2 - 74.6%\n74.3 - 77.3%\n74.6 - 90.1%\nExpected life (years) 4.5 - 4.6\n4.5\n3.5 - 4.8\nExpected dividends 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nRisk-free interest rate 1.0 - 2.9%\n0.2-0.7%\n0.3-1.6%\nThe following tables provide information about outstanding options for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020:\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022\nNumber of Options Weighted Average\nExercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding options, beginning of period 2,952,092 $ 6.97 5.6 $ 14,419\nGranted 904,500 $ 8.86\nExercised (121,248) $ 6.30 $ (53)\nForfeited (205,511) $ 8.09\nExpired - $ -\nOutstanding options, end of period 3,529,833 $ 7.41 4.5 $ 194\nExercisable options, end of period 1,538,302 $ 6.79 4.5 $ 183\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021\nNumber of Options Weighted Average\nExercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding options, beginning of period 2,437,425 $ 6.43 6.2 $ 1,411\nGranted 755,000 $ 8.40\nExercised (74,667) $ 3.81 $ (601)\nForfeited (165,666) $ 6.90\nExpired - $ -\nOutstanding options, end of period 2,952,092 $ 6.97 5.6 $ 14,419\nExercisable options, end of period 1,040,131 $ 6.52 5.1 $ 5,558\nFor the year ended June 30, 2020\nNumber of Options Weighted Average\nExercise Price Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\n(in thousands)\nOutstanding options, beginning of period 1,127,098 $ 4.84 4.3 $ 2,917\nGranted 2,075,760 $ 6.47\nExercised (440,435) $ 2.48 $ (595)\nForfeited (324,998) $ 6.55\nExpired - $ -\nOutstanding options, end of period 2,437,425 $ 6.43 6.2 $ 1,411\nExercisable options, end of period 560,871 $ 6.01 4.8 $ 559\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share for the Company's stock options granted during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $5.12, $4.92, and $3.84, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $3.0 million, $2.4 million, and $1.7 million, respectively.\nPerformance based awards\nThe Company has awarded stock options to certain executives which vest each year over a three to four year period. These stock options are also subject to the achievement of performance goals to be established by the Company's Board for each fiscal\nyear.\nOn January 27, 2021, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors established the performance metrics as a price target for the trading price of the Companys common stock in each applicable fiscal year. The price target is achieved if the average closing price of the common stock during any consecutive 30-trading-day period during the applicable fiscal year meets or exceeds: (i) $10.50 in the case of fiscal year 2021; (ii) $13.50 in the case of fiscal year 2022; (iii) $16.50 in the case of fiscal year 2023; and (iv) $19.50 in the case of fiscal year 2024. If at least 80% of the performance goals for an applicable fiscal year are achieved, the Compensation Committee may determine that the portion of the option eligible to vest based on such fiscal years performance will vest on a prorated basis. In so determining, the Compensation Committee will consider the Companys performance relative to its market competitors and any other considerations deemed relevant by the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committees guideline is generally that for every percentage point the achieved price falls below the price target, the percentage of the performance options eligible to vest in respect of the applicable fiscal year should be reduced by 2%, but the Compensation Committee may vary this formula in its sole discretion.\nFor these performance based awards that provide discretion to the Compensation Committee, a mutual understanding of the key\nterms and conditions between the Company and the employees have not yet been met and a grant date has not been established. When the service period begins prior to the grant date, the Company begins recognizing compensation cost before there is a grant date. The Company estimates the award's fair value at each reporting period for these equity classified awards, until the grant date, utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. The total expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 for these awards was $1.0 million and $2.1 million, respectively.\nSTOCK GRANTS\nThe Company makes annual grants of restricted shares of common stock to executive officers pursuant to long-term stock incentive plans (LTIPs) which vest annually, typically over three years.\nThe Company also grants restricted stock units (\"RSU\"s) to members of the board of directors as compensation for their service on the board as well as to employees as additional compensation. These stock awards typically vest over a one to three year period.\nTwo employees of Hudson Executive, a greater than 10% shareholder and a related party of the Company, entered into consulting agreements with the Company in August and September of 2020, respectively, under which the consultants were to provide financial and strategic analysis and advisory services to the Company's CEO through July 31, 2021. As consideration for the services, in March 2021 the consultants were granted a total of 80,000 restricted stock units. The total expense recognized as of June 30, 2021 for these agreements was $0.8 million. These restricted stock units had fully vested as of June 30, 2021.\nDuring August and September of 2021, the Company extended these consulting agreements to provide advisory services from August 1, 2021 through July 31, 2022. As consideration for the extended agreements the consultants were granted an additional 20,000 restricted stock units. The restricted stock units granted to each consultant vested in equal installments on January 1, 2022 and July 1, 2022. On February 2, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Company appointed one of the above mentioned employees of Hudson Executive as a director of the Company, effective immediately. In connection with the appointment to the Board, the consulting agreement for that individual was terminated, effective February 2, 2022. Total expense recognized for the year ended June 30, 2022 for these consulting agreements was $0.2 million.\nA summary of the status of the Companys nonvested common shares and RSUs as of June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, and changes during the years then ended is presented below:\nShares Weighted-Average\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nNonvested at June 30, 2019 38,971 $ 9.19\nGranted 651,715 7.28\nVested (109,050) 7.52\nForfeited (368,622) 7.89\nNonvested at June 30, 2020 213,014 $ 6.50\nGranted 187,848 10.33\nVested (248,016) 7.71\nForfeited (15,000) $ 6.28\nNonvested at June 30, 2021 137,846 $ 9.57\nGranted 507,729 7.33\nVested (101,515) 10.34\nForfeited (95,152) 8.89\nNonvested at June 30, 2022 448,908 $ 7.00\nSTOCK BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nThe Company applies the fair value method to recognize compensation expense for stock-based awards. Using this method, the estimated grant-date fair value of the award is recognized over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur.\nA summary of the Company's stock-based compensation expense recognized during the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 is as follows (in thousands):\nFor the year ended June 30,\nAward type 2022 2021 2020\nStock options $ 4,424 $ 7,806 $ 2,181\nStock grants 1,824 1,269 848\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 6,248 $ 9,075 $ 3,029\nThe Company recognized tax benefits of $0.6 million, $2.4 million, and $0.5 million related to stock compensation expense for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nA summary of the Company's unrecognized stock-based compensation expense as of June 30, 2022 is as follows:\nAs of June 30, 2022\nAward type Unrecognized Expense\n(in thousands) Weighted Average Recognition Period\n(in years)\nStock options $ 4,223 2.4\nStock grants $ 2,131 1.5\n16. PREFERRED STOCK\nThe authorized Preferred Stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series, each series with such rights, preferences or restrictions as determined by the Board of Directors. As of June 30, 2022 each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is convertible into 0.1988 of a share of Common Stock and each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to 0.1988 of a vote on all matters on which the holders of Common Stock are entitled to vote. Series A Convertible Preferred Stock provides for an annual cumulative dividend of $1.50 per share, payable when, and if declared by the Board of Directors, to the shareholders of record in equal parts on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Any and all accumulated and unpaid cash dividends on the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock must be declared and paid prior to the declaration and payment of any dividends on the Common Stock.\nThe Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be called for redemption at the option of the Board of Directors for a price of $11.00 per share plus payment of all accrued and unpaid dividends. No such redemption has occurred as of June 30, 2022. In the event of any liquidation as defined in the Companys Articles of Incorporation, the holders of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued shall be entitled to receive $10.00 for each outstanding share plus all cumulative unpaid dividends. If funds are insufficient for this distribution, the assets available will be distributed ratably among the preferred shareholders. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock liquidation preference as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\n($ in thousands) June 30,\n2022 June 30,\nFor shares outstanding at $10.00 per share\n$ 4,451 $ 4,451\nCumulative unpaid dividends 17,662 16,996\n$ 22,113 $ 21,447\nThe Company has determined that its Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is contingently redeemable due to the existence of deemed liquidation provisions contained in its certificate of incorporation, and therefore classifies its convertible preferred stock outside of permanent equity. The Company has not made any adjustments to the carrying value of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock to reflect the liquidation value of the shares because the Company has determined that a deemed liquidation event is not probable of occurring.\nCumulative unpaid dividends are convertible into common shares at $1,000 per common share at the option of the shareholder. During the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, no shares of Preferred Stock nor cumulative preferred dividends were converted into shares of common stock.\n17. RETIREMENT PLAN\nThe Companys 401(k) Plan (the Retirement Plan) allows employees to make voluntary contributions, beginning on their first day of active employment, up to a maximum of 100% of their annual compensation, as defined in the Retirement Plan. The Company may, in its discretion, make a matching contribution, a profit sharing contribution, a qualified non-elective contribution, and/or a safe harbor 401(k) contribution to the Retirement Plan. The Company must make an annual election, at the beginning of the plan year, as to whether it will make a safe harbor contribution to the plan. In fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company elected and made safe harbor matching contributions of 100% of the participants first 3% and 50% of the next 2% of compensation deferred into the Retirement Plan. The Companys safe harbor contributions for the years ended June 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 approximated $0.7 million, $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, and are included within general and administrative expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLitigation\nWe are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we reserve for litigation claims and assessments asserted or threatened against us when a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty.\nDepartment of Justice Subpoena\nAs previously reported, in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company responded to a subpoena received from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that sought records regarding Company activities that occurred during prior financial reporting periods, including restatements. During the current fiscal year, the DOJ staff has notified us that they have concluded their investigation and that they do not intend to proceed with any further investigation or enforcement.\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Inquiries\nSince fiscal year 2019, the Company has received inquiries from the SEC into the facts and circumstances of the 2019 Investigation and has fully cooperated with these inquiries.\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had firm commitments to purchase inventory of approximately $21.4 million over the next two years.\n19. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nA member of our Board of Directors serves as a strategic advisor to a consulting firm that we utilize for payments analytics and advisory services. These services are utilized by the Company to reduce the cost of our interchange and other processing fees charged by payment processors and credit card networks. As consideration for the services, we pay the consulting firm a success fee based on the savings realized by the Company and a recurring monthly subscription fee for the analytics services. The total expense recognized within Cost of subscription and transaction fees for the year ended June 30, 2022 for these arrangements was $1.1 million.

Controls and Procedures\na) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)), have concluded that, due to the existence of material weaknesses in our internal controls in the Companys internal control over financial reporting described below, and based on the evaluation of these controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2022.\nNotwithstanding the existence of the material weaknesses described below, management believes that the consolidated financial statements and related financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). Furthermore, we believe that the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are accurate.\nb) Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, due to the following material weaknesses:\nManagement did not maintain appropriately designed entity-level controls impacting the control environment, risk assessment procedures, and monitoring activities to prevent or detect material misstatements to the consolidated financial statements. These deficiencies were attributed to insufficient identification and assessment of risks impacting the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, and insufficient evaluation and determination as to whether components of internal control were present and functioning based upon evidence maintained for activity level controls, including management review controls, across substantially all of the Companys financial statement areas.\nManagement did not maintain effective information technology general controls in the areas of user access management, change management, and segregation of duties, within its systems supporting the Companys accounting and reporting processes. Many of the Companys manual controls dependent upon the information derived from these information technology systems were also ineffective, as management did not design and implement controls to\nvalidate the completeness and accuracy of underlying data utilized in the operation of those manual controls (referred to as information provided by the entity or IPE).\nManagement did not appropriately design and maintain controls over certain aspects of its revenue recognition process and related accounts, including controls over the appropriate identification of performance obligations within customer contracts, allocation of transaction price to those performance obligations, identification of transactions requiring gross presentation, input of executed contract terms into the Companys information systems that perform revenue recognition, including the completeness and accuracy of reports utilized in the operation of controls over revenue recognition.\nAlthough these material weaknesses did not result in any material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented, there is a possibility they could lead to a material misstatement of account balances or disclosures. Accordingly, management has concluded that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses.\nManagements Plan for Remediation\nIn response to the material weaknesses, management, with oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, has identified and begun to implement steps to remediate the material weaknesses. Our internal control remediation efforts include the following:\nEnhancing policies and procedures to improve our overall control environment and develop proper monitoring controls around timely evaluation and communication of internal control deficiencies to those parties responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and the board of directors, as appropriate.\nEnhancing user access provisioning and monitoring controls to enforce appropriate system access and segregation of duties.\nWe have recruited and continue to recruit key positions within our technology, accounting, internal audit and other support functions that will further enhance internal control capabilities, allow for appropriate segregation of duties and change management, and provide appropriate oversight and reviews.\nThe Company began improving the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the operation of certain controls within its financial reporting process in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 by working with control preparers and reviewers to enhance documentation and properly identifying control attributes. An IPE checklist has also been prepared to assist in this process.\nThe Company is redesigning existing management review controls including input of executed contract terms into the Companys information systems that perform revenue recognition.\nWe are committed to ensuring that our internal controls over financial reporting are designed and operating effectively. Management believes the efforts taken to date and the planned remediation will improve the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. While these remediation efforts are ongoing, the controls must be operating effectively for a sufficient period of time and be tested by management in order to consider them remediated and conclude that the design is effective to address the risks of material misstatement. The company anticipates completing the remediation of the controls related to revenue and associated accounts by the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. We also anticipate the remediation of the identified material weakness regarding information technology general controls and managements design and monitoring activities of entity level controls to be remediated by the end of fiscal year 2023.\nc) Attestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, BDO USA, LLP, as auditor of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022.\nd) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the material weaknesses and the management remediation plan described above, there were no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
