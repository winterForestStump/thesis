These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Financial Statements located in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRISKS RELATING TO OUR COMPANY GENERALLY\nOur results of operations could fluctuate due to factors outside of our control.\nOur operating results have historically fluctuated significantly, and we could continue to experience fluctuations or declining operating results due to factors that may or may not be within our control. Such factors include the following:\nfluctuating demand for our products and services;\nchanges in economic conditions and the amount of consumers discretionary spending;\nchanges in technologies favored by consumers;\ncustomer refunds or cancellations;\nour ability to continue to bill our customers through existing means;\nmarket acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our services or products;\nnew product offerings or price competition (or pricing changes) by us or our competitors;\nwith respect to our retail segment, the opening of new stores by competitors in our markets;\nwith respect to our manufacturing segment, changes in import tariffs;\nthe amount and timing of expenditures for the acquisition of new businesses and the expansion of our operations, including the hiring of new employees, capital expenditures, and related costs (including\nwage cost increases due to historically low unemployment rates and staffing shortages in certain industries);\ninflationary trends, including recent steep increases in the costs of consumer goods (as measured by CPI), including rising prices for gasoline, may dampen consumer spending at our retail establishments;\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting adverse economic conditions the pandemic has had and may continue to have on our business, financial condition and results of operations;\ntechnical difficulties or failures affecting our technical and operating systems in general; and\nthe fixed nature of a significant amount of our operating expenses.\nOur obligations under our consolidated indebtedness are significant.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had approximately $152.8 million of total consolidated principal indebtedness outstanding consisting of (in 000's):\nNotes Payable\nRevolver loans $ 56,779\nEquipment loans 15,486\nTerm loans 14,290\nOther notes payable 15,789\nSubtotal notes payable 102,344\nRelated Party Notes Payable\nIsaac Capital Group, LLC, 12.5% interest rate, matures May 2025 $ 2,000\nSpriggs Investments, LLC, 10% interest rate, matures July 2024 2,000\nSpriggs Investments, LLC for Flooring Liquidators, 12% interest rate, matures July 2024 1,000\nIsaac Capital Group, LLC revolver, 12% interest rate, matures April 2024 1,000\nIsaac Capital Group, LLC for Flooring Liquidators, 12% interest rate, matures January 2028 5,000\nSubtotal related party notes payable 11,000\nSellers Notes Payable - Related Party\nSeller of Flooring Liquidators, 8.24% interest rate, matures January 2028 34,000\nSeller of PMW, 8.0% interest rate, matures July 2028 2,500\nSeller of Kinetic, 7.% interest rate, matures September 2027 3,000\nSubtotal sellers notes payable 39,500\nTotal indebtedness $ 152,844\nThese financial obligations may have significant negative consequences for us, including:\nlimiting our ability to satisfy our obligations;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less debt;\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, changes in our industry and economic downturns;\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make capital expenditures and other investments;\nrestricting our and our wholly-owned subsidiaries ability to make dividend payments and other payments;\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make principal and/or interest payments on our outstanding debt;\nexposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under certain of our credit facilities; and\ncausing our failure to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in our current or future indebtedness, which could cause a default under such indebtedness and which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nBecause of our floating rate credit facilities, we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes.\nOur financial position may be affected by fluctuations in interest rates, as our floating rate credit facilities are subject to floating interest rates. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and international economic and political conditions, and other factors beyond our control. Due to our current borrowings under our floating rate credit facilities, or if we were to increase our floating rate credit borrowings, an increase in interest rates could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. As of the year ended September 30, 2023, our amount of floating rate credit borrowings was approximately $56.8 million.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth and business, our management, administrative, operational, and financial infrastructure and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe have expanded our Company over the past few years through the acquisition of different businesses in different industries. We intend to acquire additional businesses (possibly in different sectors) in the future. Significant expansion of our present operations will be required to capitalize on potential growth in market opportunities, will require us to add additional management personnel, and will require us to continue to upgrade our financial and management systems and controls and information technology infrastructure. Any further expansion will also place a significant strain on our existing management, operational, and financial resources. Additionally, due to changing conditions in financial markets, financing may be more difficult or expensive to obtain at rates and terms that are acceptable to the Company.\nAlthough we currently have no material long-term need for capital expenditures at our existing operating subsidiaries, we will likely be required to make increased capital expenditures to fund our anticipated growth of operations, infrastructure, and personnel. In the future, we may need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt (including convertible debt) or equity, depending upon the results of our operations, market conditions, or unforeseen needs or opportunities. Our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors, including:\nthe pace of expansion of our operations;\nour response to competitive pressures; and\nfuture acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or businesses.\nThe sale of equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nIf we identify a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, fail to remediate a material weaknesses, or fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe effectiveness of any controls or procedures is subject to certain inherent limitations, and as a result, there can be no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent or detect misstatements. Even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting will provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluations of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIf we fail to remediate a material weakness, or are otherwise unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, management could be required to expend significant resources and we could fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, and be subject to fines, penalties, investigations or judgements, all of which could negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact our stock price.\nOur failure to comply with various applicable federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations could have a material, adverse impact on our business.\nVarious federal and state employment and labor laws and regulations govern our relationships with our employees. These laws and regulations relate to matters, such as employment discrimination, wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules, healthcare laws and regulations (including with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic), and anti-discrimination and anti-harassment laws. Complying with these laws and regulations subjects us to substantial expense and non-compliance could expose us to significant liabilities. We have previously been subject to litigation regarding certain of these matters and may be subject to similar cases in the future. We could suffer losses from these and similar cases, and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate (as well as the federal government) have from time-to-time enacted minimum wage increases, changes to eligibility for overtime pay, changes to paid sick leave, changes to mandatory vacation accruals, and changes to other similar requirements. These changes have increased our labor costs and may have a further negative impact on our labor costs in the future.\nA significant number of our employees are paid at rates related to the applicable minimum wage. Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters will likely, to the extent implemented, materially increase our labor and other costs. Several states in which we operate have approved minimum wage increases that are above the federal minimum. As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, our labor costs will continue to increase. Our ability to respond to minimum wage increases by increases in our prices depends on the willingness of our customers to pay higher prices and our perceived value relative to our competitors. Our distributors and suppliers could also be affected by higher minimum wages, benefit standards, and compliance costs, which would result in higher costs for goods and services that they supply to us.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights adequately.\nOur success depends both on our internally developed technology and licensed third-party technology. We rely on a variety of trademarks, service marks, and designs to promote our brand names and identity. We also rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures, and trademark, copyright, trade secrecy, unfair competition, and other intellectual property laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our products and services. The commercially reasonable steps we take to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property and may not prevent our competitors from gaining access to our intellectual property and proprietary information. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that courts will always uphold our intellectual property rights or enforce the contractual arrangements that we have entered into to obtain and protect our proprietary technology.\nThird parties, including our partners, contractors, or employees may infringe or misappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade dress, and other proprietary rights. Any such infringement or misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon or otherwise decrease the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights, which may result in the dilution of the brand identity of our services and the pricing of our services.\nWe may decide to initiate litigation in order to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our proprietary rights. Any such litigation could result in substantial expense and may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or services infringe or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Any such claim or litigation against us, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and harm our reputation. In addition, such claims or litigation could force us to do one or more of the following:\ncease selling or using any of our products and services that incorporate the subject intellectual property, which would adversely affect our revenue;\nattempt to obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed or misappropriated, which license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all; and\nattempt to redesign or, in the case of trademark claims, rename our products or services to avoid infringing or misappropriating the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may be costly and time-consuming and fail to gain market acceptance.\nEven if we were to prevail, such claims or litigation could be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and could result in the diversion of our managements time and attention. These expenses and diversion of managerial resources could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, financial condition, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nWe may be subject to intellectual property claims that create uncertainty about ownership or use of technology essential to our business and divert our managerial and other resources.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. Third parties may, in the future, claim our current or future services, products, trademarks, technologies, business methods or processes infringe their intellectual property rights, or challenge the validity of our intellectual property rights. We may be subject to patent infringement claims or other intellectual property infringement claims that would be costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain critical technologies or business methods. We may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the patent and trademark offices of various countries to determine the priority of inventions.\nThe defense and prosecution, if necessary, of intellectual property suits, interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings can become very costly and may divert our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. We may not prevail in any of these suits or proceedings. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could require us to pay substantial compensatory and exemplary damages, could restrain us from using critical technologies, business methods or processes, and could result in us losing, or not gaining, valuable intellectual property rights.\nFurthermore, due to the voluminous amount of discovery frequently conducted in connection with intellectual property litigation, some of our confidential information could be disclosed to competitors during this type of litigation. In addition, public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation could be perceived negatively by investors, and thus have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nData breaches involving customer or employee data stored by us could adversely affect our reputation and revenues.\nWe collect and store confidential information with respect to our customers and employees. A compromise of our data security systems or those of businesses with which we interact could result in information related to our customers or employees being obtained by unauthorized persons. Any such breach of our systems could lead to fraudulent activity resulting in claims and lawsuits against us or other operational problems or interruptions in connection with such breaches. Any breach or unauthorized access in the future could result in significant legal and financial exposure and damage to our reputation that could potentially have an adverse effect on our business. While we also seek to obtain assurances that others with whom we interact will protect confidential information, there is a risk the confidentiality of data held or accessed by others may be compromised. If a compromise of our data security or function of our computer systems or website were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition, cash flows and liquidity and possibly, subject us to additional legal, regulatory and operating costs and damage our reputation in the marketplace.\nAlso, the interpretation and enforcement of data protection laws in the United States and abroad are uncertain and, in certain circumstances, contradictory. These laws may be interpreted and enforced in a manner that is inconsistent with our policies and practices. If we are subject to data security breaches or government-imposed fines, we may have a loss in sales or be forced to pay damages or other amounts, which could adversely affect profitability, or be subject to substantial costs related to compliance.\nTax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreements with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives.\nWe are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other state and local taxing authorities with respect to our tax filings. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There\ncan be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations.\nWe are involved in an ongoing SEC investigation, which could divert managements focus, result in substantial investigation expenses and have an adverse impact on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers\u2009-\u2009Jon Isaac, the Companys current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the Company Defendants) as well as certain other related third parties (the SEC Complaint). The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share data, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, purported inaccurate disclosure regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Company Defendants, permanent officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third-party defendants moved to dismiss the SEC complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants motion to dismiss, but granted one of the third-party defendants motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. The court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. The parties participated in a mediation in June 2023. The mediation was not successful and the case is currently in the midst of discovery. Discovery deadlines have been extended because counsel for JanOne and Virland Johnson moved to withdraw on August 18, 2023, which motion the court granted on October 2, 2023. JanOne and Virland Johnson have until January 4, 2024, to obtain new counsel, after which time the Company anticipates depositions will commence.\nThe SEC complaint has been costly to defend and has and may continue to divert our management personnel from their normal responsibilities. Further, we may not prevail in the SEC complaint. An adverse determination of the SEC complaint against any of the Company Defendants - including the Company and certain of our executive officers - could require us to pay substantial fines and damages, could restrain certain executive officers from providing director and officer services to the Company, and could negatively affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY\nWe may not be able to identify, acquire or establish control of, or effectively integrate previously acquired businesses, which could materially adversely affect our growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a wide array of potential strategic transactions, including acquisitions of new businesses, as well as strategic investments and joint ventures. Although we regularly evaluate such opportunities, we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or investment opportunities successfully, obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms or at all to fund such strategic transactions, complete any such acquisitions and integrate the acquired businesses with our existing businesses, or manage profitable acquired businesses or strategic investments.\nThe acquisition of a company or business is accompanied by a number of risks, including:\nfailure of due diligence during the acquisition process;\nadverse short-term effects on reported operating results;\nthe potential loss of key partners or key personnel in connection with, or as the result of, a transaction;\nthe impairment of relationships with clients of the acquired business, or our own customers, partners or employees, as a result of any integration of operations or the expansion of our offerings;\nthe recording of goodwill and intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges;\nthe diversion of managements time and resources;\nthe risk of entering into markets or producing products where we have limited or no experience, including the integration or removal of the acquired or disposed products with or from our existing products; and\nthe inability properly to implement or remediate internal controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at businesses that prior to our acquisition were not subject to federal securities laws and may have lacked appropriate controls, procedures and policies.\nThe acquisition of new businesses is costly and such acquisitions may not enhance our financial condition.\nOur growth strategy is to acquire companies and identify and acquire assets and technologies from companies in various industries that have a demonstrated history of strong earnings potential. The process to undertake a potential acquisition is time-consuming and costly. We expend significant resources to undertake business, financial, and legal due diligence on our potential acquisition target and there is no guarantee that we would acquire a target company after we complete due diligence.\nOur acquisitions could result in the use of substantial amounts of cash, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or convertible debt securities, significant write-downs of goodwill, and other intangible assets and exposure to undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired companies. To the extent that the goodwill arising from the acquisitions carried on the financial statements does not pass the goodwill impairment test, excess goodwill will be charged to, and reduce, future earnings.\nBecause we do not intend to use our own employees or members of management to run the daily operations at our acquired companies, business operations might be interrupted if employees at the acquired businesses were to resign, or be terminated.\nAs part of our acquisition strategy, we do not use our own employees or members of our management team to operate the acquired companies. Key members of management at these acquired companies have been in place for several years and have established relationships with their customers. Competition for executive-level personnel is strong and we can make no assurance that we will be able to retain these key members of management for any period of time. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of these key members of management and provided incentives to stay with the business after it has been acquired, if such key persons were to resign, we might face impairment of relationships with remaining employees or customers, which might cause long-term customers to terminate their relationships with the acquired companies, which may, in turn, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR RETAIL-ENTERTAINMENT AND RETAIL-FLOORING SEGMENTS\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. could adversely affect demand for the products we sell.\nSales of products are driven, in part, by discretionary spending by consumers. Consumers are typically more likely to make discretionary purchases, including purchasing movies, games, music, flooring, and other discretionary products when there are favorable economic conditions. Consumer spending may be affected by many economic factors outside of our control, such as a decline in consumer confidence in current and future economic conditions, levels of employment, consumer debt levels, and inflation. These and other economic factors could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnological advances in the delivery and types of video, video games and PC entertainment software, as well as changes in consumer behavior related to these new technologies, could lower sales.\nWhile it is currently possible to download video, video game content, and music to the current generation of video and gaming systems, downloading is somewhat constrained by bandwidth capacity and video game and movie file sizes. However, broadband speeds are increasing and downloading technology is becoming more prevalent and continues to evolve rapidly. The current game consoles from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo have facilitated download technology. If these consoles and other advances in technology continue to expand our customers ability to access and download the current format of video, music and games and incremental content from their games and videos through these and other\nsources, our customers may no longer choose to purchase videos, DVDs, video games and music in our stores or they may reduce their purchases in favor of other forms of video, digital, and game delivery. As a result, our sales and earnings could decline.\nVintage Stock may not compete effectively as browser, mobile and social video viewing and gaming becomes more popular.\nListening to music, gaming, and viewing video and digital content continues to evolve rapidly. The popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming have increased greatly, and this popularity is expected to continue to grow. Browser, mobile and social video viewing, listening to music and gaming are accessed through hardware other than the game consoles and traditional hand-held video and game devices we currently sell. If there is continued growth in popularity of browser, mobile and social viewing and gaming, our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be impacted negatively.\nSales of video games containing graphic violence may decrease as a result of actual violent events or other reasons, and Vintage Stocks, and our, financial results may be adversely affected as a result.\nMany popular video games contain material with graphic violence. These games receive an M or T rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board. As actual violent events occur and are publicized, or for other reasons, public acceptance of graphic violence in video games may decline. Consumer advocacy groups may increase their efforts to oppose sales of graphically-violent video games and may seek legislation prohibiting their sales. As a result, our sales of those games may decrease, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAs a seller of certain consumer products, we are subject to various federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and statutes related to product safety and consumer protection.\nWhile we take steps to comply with these laws, there can be no assurance that they will be in compliance, and failure to comply with these laws could result in penalties that could have a negative impact on their respective businesses, financial condition, and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Each of them may also be subject to involuntary or voluntary product recalls or product liability lawsuits. Direct costs or reputational damage associated with product recalls or product liability lawsuits, individually or in the aggregate, could have a negative impact on future revenues and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nInternational events could delay or prevent the delivery of products to our suppliers.\nSome of our suppliers rely on foreign sources to manufacture a portion of the products or raw materials that we purchase from them. As a result, any event causing a disruption of imports, including natural disasters, supply chain disruptions or the imposition of import restrictions or trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available, which could lower their sales and profitability and, indirectly, ours.\nIf we are unable to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms, our revenue growth may decline.\nAll of our retail stores are located in leased premises. If the cost of leasing existing stores increases, we can't be certain that we will be able to maintain its existing store locations as leases expire. In addition, we may not be able to enter into new leases on favorable terms or at all, or may not be able to locate suitable alternative sites or additional sites for new store expansion in a timely manner. Its revenues and earnings may decline if it fails to maintain existing store locations, enter into new leases, locate alternative sites, or find additional sites for new store expansion.\nAn adverse trend in sales during the winter and holiday selling season could impact our financial results.\nOur retail business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with a major portion of Vintage Stocks sales realized around various holidays and other days, including Black Friday, Presidents Day, tax refund season, Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day. Any adverse trend in sales during these times could negatively impact their results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nResults of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nResults of operations may fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending upon several factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:\nthe timing and allocations of new product releases;\nthe timing of new store openings or closings;\nshifts in the timing or content or certain promotions or service offerings;\nthe effect of changes in tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we are operating;\nacquisition costs and the integration of companies we acquire or invest in; and\nthe costs associated with the exit of unprofitable markets or stores.\nThese and other factors could affect its business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and liquidity, and this makes the prediction of our financial results on a quarterly basis difficult. Also, it is possible that our quarterly financial results may be below the expectations of public market analysts.\nFailure to manage our new store openings effectively could lower our sales and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends in part upon opening new stores and operating them profitably. Their ability to open new stores and operate them profitability depends upon a number of factors, some of which may be beyond our control. These factors include the ability to:\nidentify new store locations, negotiate suitable leases and build out the stores in a timely and cost-efficient manner;\nhire and train skilled associates;\nintegrate new stores into existing operations; and\nincrease sales at new store locations.\nIf we fail to manage new store openings in a timely and cost-efficient manner, our growth or profits may decrease.\nIf our management information systems fail to perform or are inadequate, our ability to manage our business could be disrupted.\nWe rely on computerized inventory and management systems to coordinate and manage the activities in our stores and distribution centers. We use inventory replenishment systems to track sales and inventory. Our ability to rapidly process incoming shipments of new products and deliver them to all of our stores enables us to meet peak demand and replenish our stores to keep them in stock at optimal levels and to move inventory efficiently. If our inventory or management information systems fail to perform these functions adequately, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, if operations in any of our distribution centers were to shut down or be disrupted for a prolonged period of time or if these centers were unable to accommodate the continued store growth in a particular region, our business would suffer.\nWe may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges which could negatively impact our future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have previously recorded significant goodwill. Because we have grown in part through acquisitions, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets represent a substantial portion of our assets. We also have long-lived assets consisting of property and equipment and other identifiable intangible assets which we review both on an annual basis as well as when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If a determination is made that a significant impairment in value of goodwill, other intangible assets, or long-lived assets has occurred, such determination could require us to impair a substantial portion of our assets. Asset impairments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSpecific to our Retail-Flooring Segment\nThe floor covering industry may face supply chain restrictions based upon legislation enacted limiting imports from certain global regions.\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (the UFLPA), effective June 21, 2022, provides a rebuttable presumption that goods mined, produced, or manufactured wholly or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China are prohibited from U.S. importation. Imports of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), a major component in the production of luxury vinyl flooring and sourced from the Xinjiang region, may be examined pursuant to the UFLPA under\nthe presumption it was produced using forced labor. A disruption in the import of PVC could have an impact on our supply chain and inventory levels, thereby negatively impacting our operating results.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR FLOORING MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe floor covering industry is sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, such as consumer confidence and income, corporate and government spending, interest rate levels, availability of credit and demand for housing. Significant or prolonged declines in the U.S. or global economies could have a material adverse effect on the Companys flooring manufacturing business.\nDownturns in the U.S. and global economies, along with the residential and commercial markets in such economies, negatively impact the floor covering industry and our flooring manufacturing business. Although difficult economic conditions have improved in the U.S., there may be additional downturns in the future that could cause the industry to deteriorate. A significant or prolonged decline in residential or commercial remodeling or new construction activity could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMarquis may be unable to predict customer preferences or demand accurately, or to respond to technological developments.\nMarquis operates in a market sector where demand is strongly influenced by rapidly changing customer preferences as to product design and technical features. Failure to respond quickly and effectively to changing customer demand or technological developments could materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nMarquis faces intense competition in the flooring industry that could decrease demand for its products or force it to lower its prices, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations generally.\nThe floor covering industry is highly competitive. Marquis faces competition from a number of manufacturers and independent distributors, many of whom have greater financial and operational resources than it. Maintaining its competitive position may require substantial investments in its product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. Competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for our products or force it to lower its prices. Moreover, a strong U.S. dollar, combined with lower fuel costs, may contribute to more attractive pricing for imports that compete with Marquis products, which may put pressure on its pricing. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nIn periods of rising costs, Marquis may be unable to pass raw materials, energy and fuel-related cost increases on to its customers, which could have a material adverse effect on its business operations and prospects, financial condition, liquidity, cash flow, profitability, and results of operations.\nThe prices of raw materials and fuel-related costs vary significantly with market conditions. Although Marquis generally attempts to pass on increases in raw material, energy, and fuel-related costs to its customers, its ability to do so is dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase, competitive pressures, and market conditions for its products. There have been in the past, and may be in the future, periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered. During such periods of time, the occurrence of such events may materially adversely affect Marquis business, financial condition, and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR STEEL MANUFACTURING SEGMENT\nThe demand for steel manufacturing segment's products may decrease if manufacturing in North America declines or if automakers, who manufacture their products in the U.S., do not introduce new models or their sales decline.\nThe products manufactured by our steel manufacturing segment typically follow the North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing cycle, with a large emphasis on automotive manufacturing. If North American (primarily, the U.S.) manufacturing is transferred offshore, then the need for our products to make tools and dies will decrease, which will have a negative impact on the steel manufacturing segments business, financial condition (including, without limitation, its liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, we rely heavily on the sale of our products to automakers who purchase our products when they retool production lines in connection with the introduction of new models. If those automakers do not introduce a new model in any given year, our sales may decrease which will have a negative impact on\nour business, financial condition (including, without limitation, our liquidity), results of operations, and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nLimited availability, or volatility in prices of raw materials and energy may constrain operating levels and reduce profit margins.\nOur steel manufacturing segment and other steel producers have periodically faced problems obtaining sufficient raw materials in a timely manner, and sometimes at all, due to a limited number of suppliers, delays, defaults, severe weather conditions, force majeure events (including public health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and global supply chain issues and disruptions), shortages, or transportation problems (such as shortages of barges, vessels, rail cars or trucks, or disruption of rail lines, waterways, or natural gas transmission lines), resulting in production curtailments. As a result, we may be exposed to risks concerning pricing and availability of raw materials from third parties, as well as supply and logistics constraints moving its own raw materials to its plants. In addition, if the already limited number of suppliers consolidate, it would limit our steel manufacturing segments negotiating power for raw material purchases.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, purchase raw materials from sources even when they are at above market prices. Additionally, any future decreases in iron ore, scrap, natural gas and oil prices may place downward pressure on steel prices. If steel prices decline, our steel manufacturing segments profit margins could temporarily be reduced, as higher cost inventory is turned over.\nShortages of qualified and trainable labor, increased labor costs, or our steel manufacturing segments failure to attract and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial results.\nOur steel manufacturing segment depends on skilled or trainable drug-free labor for the manufacture of its products. Its continued success depends on the active participation of its key employees. Our steel manufacturing segment, like other companies that rely on a trained blue-collar workforce, receives pressure from other manufacturers regarding the labor pool. Our steel manufacturing segment, aside from competing with other manufacturers, also competes with non-industrial blue-collar professions for labor. Should a significant employer move into our geographical area, such employer could draw from the current labor pool and require a substantial increase in training expense.\nOur operational footprint, unplanned equipment outages, and other unforeseen disruptions may adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur steel manufacturing segment has adjusted its business model over time to utilize its equipment and manufacturing facility fully. Production depends on running at a moderate rate of capacity. Outages due to power outages, weather, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), or machine outages affect its capability to produce at the level necessary to meet customer demand or at all.\nIt is also possible that operations may be disrupted due to other unforeseen circumstances, such as union and other foreign tariffs, free trade agreements, trade regulations, laws, and policies. Our steel manufacturing segment is also exposed to similar risks involving major customers and suppliers, such as force majeure events of raw materials suppliers that have occurred and may occur in the future. Availability of raw materials and delivery of products to customers could be affected by logistical disruptions, such as shortages of barges, ocean vessels, rail cars or trucks, or unavailability of rail lines or of the locks on the Great Lakes or other bodies of water. To the extent that lost production could not be compensated for at unaffected facilities and depending on the length of the outage, our sales and our unit production costs could be adversely affected.\nOur production and distribution workforce is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nPrecision Marshalls manufacturing employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the United Steelworkers and its warehouse and distribution workforce employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement through the International Association of Aeronautical and Machinists. These agreements were successfully renegotiated during 2021 without a work stoppage, and were extended through September 2026 and April 2026, respectively. Future negotiations prior to the expiration of the collective bargaining agreements may result in labor unrest for which a strike or work stoppage is possible. Strikes and/or work stoppages could negatively affect Precision Marshalls operational and financial results and may increase operating expenses and, indirectly, ours.\nWe rely on third parties for transportation services, and increases in costs or the availability of transportation may adversely affect our business and operations\nOur steel manufacturing segments business depends on the transportation of a large number of products. It relies primarily on third parties for transportation of its products, as well as delivery of its raw materials. Any increase in the cost of the transportation of our raw materials or products, as a result of increases in fuel or labor costs, higher demand for logistics services, consolidation in the transportation industry, or otherwise, may adversely affect our steel manufacturing segments results of operations, as it may not be able to pass such cost increases on to its customers.\nIf any of these transportation service providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, it might be unable to manufacture and deliver its products in response to customer demand. In addition, if any of these third parties were to cease operations or cease doing business with us, it might be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost or at any cost, as there are a limited number of suppliers worldwide for our steel manufacturing segments raw materials.\nIn addition, such failure of a third-party transportation provider could harm our steel manufacturing segment's reputation, negatively affect its customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on its financial position and results of operations and, indirectly, ours.\nWe face risks relating to changes in U.S. and foreign tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and policies\nOur steel manufacturing segments business depends on manufacturing products in North America. If tariffs were to rise disproportionally on raw materials compared to finished goods, we would be at risk for manufacturers to cease purchasing the products from it and instead purchasing products from third parties who are not subject to such tariffs, trade agreements, laws, and/or policies.\nThe steel industry is highly cyclical, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nSteel consumption is highly cyclical and generally follows economic and industrial conditions both worldwide and in regional markets. This volatility makes it difficult to balance the procurement of raw materials and energy with global steel prices, our steel production and customer product demand. Our steel manufacturing segment has implemented strategic initiatives to produce more variable results during periods of economic and market downturns; but, this may not be enough to mitigate the effect that the volatility inherent in the steel industry has on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, our steel manufacturing segments business is reliant on certain other industries that are cyclical in nature. Precision Marshall sells to distributors, who, in turn, sell to the automotive, appliance, defense, and construction-related industries. Some of these industries exhibit a great deal of sensitivity to general economic conditions and may also face meaningful fluctuations in demand based on a number of factors outside of our control, including regulatory factors, economic conditions, and raw material and energy costs. As a result, downturns, or volatility in any of the markets served could adversely affect our steel manufacturing segments financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, indirectly, ours.\nCompliance with existing and new environmental regulations, environmental permitting and approval requirements may result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nSteel producers in the U.S., along with their customers and suppliers, are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations concern the generation, storage, transportation, disposal, emission or discharge of pollutants, contaminants and hazardous substances into the environment, the reporting of such matters, and the general protection of public health and safety, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. Steel producers in the European Union (\"EU\") are subject to similar laws. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. Additionally, compliance with certain state and local requirements could result in substantially increased capital requirements and operating costs. Compliance with current or future regulations could entail additional costs for additional systems and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Failure to comply with the requirements may result in administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, revocation of permits to conduct business or construct certain facilities, substantial fines or sanctions, enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures), natural resource damages claims, cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws, regulations, codes and common law. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and, in some cases, liability may be imposed without regard to contribution or to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of hazardous substances.\nIn addition, our steel manufacturing segment outsources all disposal of waste material, non-compliance by third party providers could result in additional costs to defend environmental claims or additional costs to replace the outsourced entities.\nThere can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses and permits will be granted or that our steel manufacturing segment will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits it currently holds. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, compliance with the environmental permitting and approval requirements may be costly and time consuming and could result in delays or other adverse impacts on planned projects, our results of operations and cash flows.\nIncreasing pressure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from steelmaking operations to comply with U.S. and EU regulations as well as societal expectations could increase costs to manufacture future raw materials or reduce the amount of materials being manufactured.\nPrecision Marshall relies on raw material sources in the EU and U.S. Tightening of those requirements in the EU and/or sources in the U.S. could deter steel produces from producing the raw material for our products or result in significant price increases of our raw material.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe depend on key persons and the loss of any key person could adversely affect our operations.\nThe future success of our business is dependent on our senior leadership team members. Our senior leadership team members have extensive sales and marketing, engineering, product development, manufacturing and finance backgrounds in the various industries our subsidiaries operate. If one or more of our key personnel are unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions, we may not be able to easily replace them, and we may incur additional expenses to recruit and train new personnel. The loss of our key personnel could severely disrupt our business and its financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to attract or retain the key personnel needed to achieve our business objectives.\nAdverse developments in our ongoing legal proceedings or future legal proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and prospects, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, or stock price.\nWe have been, and may continue to be subject to investigations, arbitration proceedings, audits, regulatory inquiries and similar actions, including matters related to intellectual property, employment, securities laws, disclosures, tax, accounting, class action and product liability, as well as regulatory and other claims related to our business and our industry, which we refer to collectively as legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of any particular proceeding, or whether ongoing investigations will be resolved favorably or ultimately result in charges or material damages, fines or other penalties, enforcement actions, bars against serving as an officer or director, or regulation by the SEC, or civil or criminal proceedings against us or members of our senior management.\nLegal proceedings in general, and securities and class action litigation and regulatory investigations in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Our insurance, to the extent maintained, may not cover all claims that may be asserted against us and we are unable to predict how long the legal proceedings to which we are currently subject will continue. An unfavorable outcome of any legal proceeding may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, prospects, or our stock price. Any proceeding could negatively impact our reputation among our stakeholders. Furthermore, publicity surrounding ongoing legal proceedings, even if resolved favorably for us, could result in additional legal proceedings against us, as well as damage our image.\nDue to our concentrated stock ownership, public stockholders may have no effective voice in our management and the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 11, 2023, Isaac Capital Group LLC (ICG), together with Jon Isaac, our President and CEO and the President and sole member of ICG, control approximately 48.8% of the outstanding voting power of our company (assuming the exercise of all outstanding and exercisable warrants held by them). Jon Isaac has the sole power to vote the shares of our common stock owned by ICG. As a result, Jon Isaac, both individually and through ICG, is able to exercise significant influence over all matters that require us to obtain stockholder approval, including the election of directors to our Board and approval of significant corporate transactions that we may consider, such as a merger or other sale of our Company or its assets. Moreover, such a concentration of voting power could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. This significant concentration of share ownership may also adversely affect the trading price\nfor our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated stock ownership.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for foreseeable future, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your shares of common stock for a price greater than your purchase price for your shares.\nWe may retain future earnings, if any, for future operation, expansion, and debt repayment and, with the exception of dividends payable on shares of our Series E Preferred Stock, we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, cash requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited by covenants of any existing and future outstanding indebtedness we or our subsidiaries incur. Therefore, any return on your investment would likely come only from an increase in the market value of our common stock. As a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nCertain provisions of Nevada law, in our organizational documents and in contracts to which we are party may prevent or delay a change of control of our company.\nWe are subject to the Nevada anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prevent Nevada corporations from engaging in a merger, consolidation, sales of its stock or assets, and certain other transactions with any stockholder, including all affiliates and associates of the stockholder, who owns 10% or more of the corporations outstanding voting stock, for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired 10% or more of the corporations voting stock, except in certain situations. In addition, our amended and restated articles of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions include the following:\nthe authority of our Board of Directors to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences, and privileges of these shares, without stockholder approval;\nstockholders must comply with advance notice requirements to transact any business at the annual meeting;\nall stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called meeting of stockholders and not by written consent, unless such action or proposal is first approved by our Board of Directors;\nspecial meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or the President of our Company;\na director may be removed from office only for cause by the holders of at least two-thirds of the voting power entitled to vote at an election of directors;\nour Board of Directors is expressly authorized to alter, amend or repeal our bylaws;\nnewly-created directorships and vacancies on our Board of Directors may only be filled by a majority of remaining directors, and not by our stockholders; and\ncumulative voting is not allowed in the election of our directors.\nThese provisions of Nevada law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could prohibit or delay mergers or other takeover or change of control of our company and may discourage attempts by other companies to acquire us, even if such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and other non-cash or nonrecurring charges. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of the business, including the business ability to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures, and to service its debt. Additionally, this measure is used by management to evaluate operating results and perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve performance. Adjusted EBITDA is also a measure that is customarily used by financial analysts to evaluate a\ncompanys financial performance, subject to certain adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA does not represent cash flows from operations, as defined by GAAP, and should not be construed as an alternative to net income or loss and is indicative neither of our results of operations, nor of cash flows available to fund all of our cash needs. It is, however, a measurement that the Company believes is useful to investors in analyzing its operating performance. Accordingly, Adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities, and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. As companies often define non-GAAP financial measures differently, Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, should not be compared to any similarly titled measures reported by other companies. A reconciliation of net income, the closest GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA is provided below.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth certain statement of income items and as a percentage of revenue, for the periods indicated (in $000s):\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 Year Ended September 30, 2022\n% of Total Revenue % of Total Revenue\nSelected Data\nRevenue $ 355,171 $ 286,913\nCost of revenue 239,605 67.5 % 189,086 65.9 %\nGeneral and administrative expenses 86,670 24.4 % 54,531 19.0 %\nSales and marketing expenses 13,447 3.8 % 12,459 4.3 %\nImpairment expense - - % 4,910 1.7 %\nInterest expense, net 12,741 3.6 % 4,209 1.5 %\nProvision for income taxes 1,571 0.4 % 6,875 2.4 %\nNet (loss) income $ (102) - % $ 24,741 8.6 %\nAdjusted EBITDA (a)\nRetail - Entertainment $ 10,581 $ 14,054\nRetail - Flooring 3,321 -\nFlooring Manufacturing 10,100 17,043\nSteel Manufacturing 12,210 10,230\nCorporate and other (4,674) (2,943)\nTotal adjusted EBITDA $ 31,538 $ 38,384\nAdjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue\nRetail - Entertainment 13.5 % 16.3 %\nRetail - Flooring 4.4 % NA\nFlooring Manufacturing 9.2 % 13.0 %\nSteel Manufacturing 13.7 % 16.9 %\nCorporate and other NA NA\nConsolidated adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue 8.9 % 13.4 %\nThe following table sets forth revenues by segment (in $000s):\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 Year Ended September 30, 2022\nNet Revenue % of Total Revenue Net Revenue % of Total Revenue\nRevenue\nRetail - Entertainment $ 78,124 22.0 % $ 86,156 30.0 %\nRetail - Flooring 75,872 21.4 % - - %\nFlooring Manufacturing 109,770 30.9 % 130,850 45.6 %\nSteel Manufacturing 88,912 25.0 % 60,617 21.1 %\nCorporate and other 2,493 0.7 % 9,290 3.2 %\nTotal revenue $ 355,171 100.0 % $ 286,913 100.0 %\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of total revenue by segment (in $000s):\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 Year Ended September 30, 2022\nGross Profit Gross Profit % of Total Revenue Gross Profit Gross Profit % of Total Revenue\nGross Profit\nRetail - Entertainment $ 42,751 37.0 % $ 45,583 46.6 %\nRetail - Flooring 27,769 24.0 % - - %\nFlooring Manufacturing 23,891 20.7 % 31,908 32.6 %\nSteel Manufacturing 20,023 17.3 % 16,878 17.3 %\nCorporate and other 1,132 1.0 % 3,458 3.5 %\nTotal revenue $ 115,566 100.0 % $ 97,827 100.0 %\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Preparation of these statements requires us to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant and material impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. Estimates and assumptions are based on management's experience and other information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements. Our actual realized results may differ materially from managements initial estimates as reported. Our critical and significant accounting policies include Trade and Other Receivables, Inventories, Goodwill, Revenue Recognition, Fair Value Measurements, Income Taxes, Segment Reporting and Concentrations of Credit Risk.\nRevenue\nRevenue increased by approximately $68.3 million to approximately $355.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to approximately $286.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nRetail-Entertainment segment revenue decreased by approximately $8.0 million, or 9.3%, to approximately $78.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $86.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, and was primarily due to reduced demand caused by a deterioration in economic conditions.\nOur Retail-Flooring segment consists of Flooring Liquidators, which we acquired in January 2023. Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $75.9 million. During the year ended September 30, 2023, Flooring Liquidators acquired certain assets of Cal Coast Carpet Warehouse, Inc.\nFlooring Manufacturing revenue decreased by approximately $21.1 million, or 16.1%, to approximately $109.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to approximately $130.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was due to reduced customer demand as a result of general economic conditions.\nSteel Manufacturing revenue increased by approximately $28.3 million, or 46.7%, to approximately $88.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to approximately $60.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic during June 2022 and PMW during July 2023, partially offset by a decrease of $6.4 million from Precision Marshall. The decrease by Precision Marshall was due to reduced customer demand as a result of general economic conditions.\nCorporate and Other revenue decreased by approximately $6.8 million, or 73.2%, to approximately $2.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to approximately $9.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the shutdown and deconsolidation of SW Financial in May 2023.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue increased by approximately $50.5 million, or 26.7% for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenues was 67.5% for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to 65.9% for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to inflationary cost increases, as well as the acquisition of PMW, which historically has generated lower margins, partially offset by the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators, which historically has generated higher margins.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense increased by approximately $32.1 million or 58.9%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic in June 2022, Flooring Liquidators in January 2023, and PMW in July 2023, which collectively contributed $33.8 million of general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for Flooring Liquidators was approximately $27.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, and was primarily comprised of compensation, rent, and amortization expense.\nSelling and Marketing Expense\nSelling and marketing expense increased by approximately $1.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to convention and trade show activity in our Flooring Manufacturing segment and Retail-Flooring segment due to the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators.\nLoss on Impairment of Intangibles and Goodwill\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, in connection with quantitative impairment testing performed on SW Financial, we recorded a $4.9 million charge for impairment of intangibles and goodwill. This amount includes approximately $3.7 million for full impairment of goodwill, and approximately $1.2 million in partial impairment of customer relationships and trade names. There were no similar impairments recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net increased by approximately $8.5 million or 202.7%, for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to increased debt balances related to the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators, Kinetic, and PMW, and to fund operations, and also higher interest rates during the period.\nGain on Bankruptcy Settlement\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a gain of approximately $11.4 million due to the discharge of certain obligations relating to the ApplianceSmart bankruptcy. No similar gains or losses were recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a provision for income tax of approximately $1.6 million, compared to a provision for income tax of approximately $6.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The year over year decrease is primarily due to a decrease in net income due to overall reduced customer demand as a result of general economic conditions.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nThe following table sets forth the results of operations by segment (in $000s):\nFor the Year Ended Sep 30, 2023 For the Year Ended Sep 30, 2022\nRetail-Entertainment Retail-Flooring Flooring\nManufacturing Steel\nManufacturing Corporate\n& Other Total Retail-Entertainment Retail-Flooring Flooring\nManufacturing Steel\nManufacturing Corporate\n& Other Total\nRevenue $ 78,124 $ 75,872 $ 109,770 $ 88,912 $ 2,493 $ 355,171 $ 86,156 $ - $ 130,850 $ 60,617 $ 9,290 $ 286,913\nCost of Revenue 35,373 48,103 85,879 68,889 1,361 239,605 40,573 - 98,942 43,739 5,832 189,086\nGross Profit 42,751 27,769 23,891 20,023 1,132 115,566 45,583 - 31,908 16,878 3,458 97,827\nGeneral and Administrative Expense 32,751 27,640 6,330 11,490 8,459 86,670 32,312 - 6,522 7,444 8,253 54,531\nSelling and Marketing Expense 735 421 11,500 555 236 13,447 643 - 11,232 568 16 12,459\nImpairment Expense - - - - - - - - - - 4,910 4,910\nOperating Income (Loss) $ 9,265 $ (292) $ 6,061 $ 7,978 $ (7,563) $ 15,449 $ 12,628 $ - $ 14,154 $ 8,866 $ (9,721) $ 25,927\nRetail-Entertainment Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased by approximately $8.0 million, or 9.3%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a deterioration in economic conditions. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 45.3% for the year ended September 30, 2023, as opposed to 47.1% for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a higher percentage of used product sales, which generate higher margins. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $440,000, and was primarily attributable to increased compensation and other general and administrative expenses related to a higher volume of retail locations open during the year. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $9.3 million, as compared to approximately $12.6 million during the prior year period primarily due to those factors discussed above.\nRetail-Flooring Segment\nOur Retail-Flooring segment consists of Flooring Liquidators, which we acquired in January 2023. Revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $75.9 million, and cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 63.%. Operating loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $290,000.\nFlooring Manufacturing Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased by approximately $21.1 million, or 16.1%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to reduced customer demand as a result of general economic conditions. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 78.2% for the year ended September 30, 2023, as opposed to 75.6% for the year ended September 30, 2022, and was primarily due to increases in raw material costs, as compared to the prior year. General and administrative expenses decreased slightly during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Sales and marketing expenses increased slightly during the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022. Operating income for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $6.1 million, as compared to operating income of approximately $14.2 million for the prior year period primarily due to those factors discussed above.\nSteel Manufacturing Segment\nRevenue for the year ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately $28.3 million, or 46.7%, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic during June 2022 and PMW during July 2023. Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue was 77.5% for the year ended September 30, 2023, as opposed to 72.2% for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of PMW, which has historically generated lower margins. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $4.0 million, or 54.4%, primarily due to the acquisitions of Kinetic and PMW, partially offset by reduced compensation expense at Precision Marshall. Operating income was approximately $8.0 million and $9.0 million, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCorporate and Other Segment\nRevenues for the year ended September 30, 2023 decreased by approximately $6.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to the shutdown and deconsolidation of SW Financial in May 2023. Cost of revenue was 54.6% for the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2023, as opposed to 62.8% for the year ended September 30, 2022. Operating loss for the year ended September 30, 2023 was approximately $7.6 million, as compared to a loss of approximately $9.7 million in the prior year. Revenues and operating income for our legacy directory services business continue to decline due to decreasing renewals. We expect revenue and operating income from this segment to continue to decrease in the future. We are no longer accepting new customers in our directory services business.\nAdjusted EBITDA Reconciliation\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, its nearest GAAP measure, for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 (in $000s):\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nNet (loss) income $ (102) $ 24,741\nDepreciation and amortization 14,257 7,168\nStock-based compensation 446 37\nInterest expense, net 12,741 4,209\nIncome tax expense 1,571 6,875\nGain on bankruptcy settlement - (11,352)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - 84\nSW Financial settlement gain (2,750) -\nDisposition of SW Financial 1,697 -\nAcquisition costs 3,554 1,470\nWrite-off of fixed assets - 438\nImpairment of goodwill and intangibles - 4,910\nOther non-recurring company initiatives 124 (196)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 31,538 $ 38,384\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $6.8 million, or 17.8%, for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to an overall decrease in operating income, as discussed above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nBased on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and funds available under our asset-based revolver lines of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations, pay our scheduled loan payments, allow for the repurchase of shares under our share buyback program, and pay dividends on our shares of Series E Preferred Stock as declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next 12 months.\nWe have the following five asset-based revolver lines of credit: (i) Texas Capital Bank Revolver Loan (TCB Revolver) utilized by Vintage Stock, (ii) Bank of America Revolver Loan (BofA Revolver) utilized by Marquis, (iii) two Fifth Third Bank Revolver Loans (Fifth Third Revolvers), one utilized by Precision Marshall and the other by PMW, and (iv) Eclipse Business Capital Revolver Loan (Eclipse Revolver) utilized by Flooring Liquidators. Additionally, we have an unsecured revolving line of credit with Isaac Capital Group (ICG Revolver), a related party, which is utilized by the Company.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had total cash availability of approximately $37.1 million, comprised of approximately $4.3 million in cash, as well as approximately $32.8 million of available borrowing under our revolving credit facilities. As we continue to pursue acquisitions and other strategic transactions to expand and grow our business, we regularly monitor capital market conditions and may raise additional funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities. The amount, nature and timing of any borrowings or sales of debt or equity securities will depend on our\noperating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe Companys cash at September 30, 2023 was approximately $4.3 million compared to approximately $4.6 million at September 30, 2022, a decrease of approximately $300,000. Net cash provided by operations was approximately $26.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to net cash provided by operations of approximately $6.4 million for the same period in 2022. The increase is primarily due to a reduction in purchases of inventory, a reduction in income taxes receivable, as well as an increase in accrued liabilities during the period. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company has reclassified approximately $8.2 million from operating activities to financing activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows for the period, which relates to proceeds received from a failed sales and leaseback transaction as part of the Kinetic acquisition. The reclassification decreased fiscal year 2022 cash generated from operating activities from $14.6 million as previously reported to $6.4 million as adjusted.\nOur primary sources of cash inflows are from customer receipts from sales on account, factored accounts receivable proceeds, and net remittances from directory services customers processed in the form of ACH billings. Our most significant cash outflows include payments for raw materials and general operating expenses, including payroll costs and general and administrative expenses that typically occur within close proximity of expense recognition.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur cash flows used in investing activities of approximately $64.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and our acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators, PMW, and Cal Coast Carpets. Our cash flows used in investing activities of approximately $40.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment and our acquisitions of Kinetic and Better Backers.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $37.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of approximately $15.8 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, net proceeds from revolver loans of approximately $13.7 million, proceeds from failed sales and leaseback transactions of $12.7 million, and proceeds from the issuance of related party debt of $7.0 million, partially offset by payments on notes payable and finance leases of approximately $10.5 million, and purchases of treasury stock of approximately $1.0 million. Proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans, the issuance of notes payable and related party notes payable was primarily associated with the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW.\nOur cash flows provided by financing activities of approximately $33.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily consisted in net proceeds from revolver loans of approximately $21.6 million, approximately $17.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of notes payable, and proceeds from a failed sales and leaseback transaction of approximately $8.2 million, partially offset by payments on notes payable and finance leases of approximately $10.6 million, and purchases of treasury stock of approximately $2.7 million. Proceeds from borrowings under revolver loans and the issuance of notes payable was primarily associated with the acquisition of Kinetic.\nCurrently, the Company is not issuing common shares for liquidity purposes. We prefer to use asset-based lending arrangements and mezzanine financing together with Company provided capital to finance acquisitions and have done so historically. Occasionally, as our Company history has demonstrated, we will issue stock and derivative instruments linked to stock for services and/or debt settlement.\nWorking Capital\nWe had working capital of approximately $85.0 million as of September 30, 2023 as compared to approximately $78.4 million as of September 30, 2022. The increase is primarily due to the net assets received from the acquisitions of Flooring Liquidators and PMW, increases in accounts receivable and inventories, partially offset by increases in accounts payable, accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term debt and the current portion of operating lease obligations.\nFuture Sources of Cash; New Products and Services\nWe may require additional debt financing or capital to finance new acquisitions, refinance existing indebtedness or other strategic investments in our business. Other sources of financing may include stock issuances and additional loans; or other forms of financing. Any financing obtained may further dilute or otherwise impair the ownership interest of our existing stockholders.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations consisting of debt obligations and lease agreements and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our future liquidity and cash flows (in $000's):\nPayments due by Period\nLess Than\nOne Year One to Three\nYears Three to Five\nYears More Than\nFive Years Total\nNotes payable $ 23,077 $ 34,275 $ 34,017 $ 10,418 $ 101,787\nNotes payable - related party 4,000 2,000 4,914 - 10,914\nSeller notes - related party - 500 38,498 - 38,998\nLease obligations 18,984 31,864 22,846 134,998 208,692\nTotal $ 46,061 $ 68,639 $ 100,275 $ 145,416 $ 360,391\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt September 30, 2023, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements, commitments or guarantees that require additional disclosure or measurement. ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nAs of September 30, 2023, we did not participate in any market risk-sensitive commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required. We believe we are not subject in any material way to other forms of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk or foreign customer purchases or commodity price risk. ITEM 8. Financial Statement and Supplementary Data\nLIVE VENTURES INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nContents\nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nReport of Frazier & Deeter, LLC (Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ID: 215)\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of (Loss) Income for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity for years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nLive Ventures Incorporated\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Live Ventures Incorporated (the \"Company\") as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of (loss) income, changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"US GAAP\").\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired Precision Metal Works, Inc. (\"PMW\"), a Kentucky-based Metal Stamping and Value-Added Manufacturing Company. PMW was acquired for a net purchase price of approximately $27 million. As part of its purchase price allocation, the Company determined $3.6 million should be allocated to customer relationship and trade name intangible assets and approximately $13.6 million to property, plant, and equipment.\nIn addition, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Flooring Liquidators, Inc., Elite Builder Services, Inc., 7 Day Stone, Inc., Floorable, LLC, K2L Leasing, LLC, and SJ & K Equipment, Inc. (collectively, \"Flooring Liquidators\"). Flooring Liquidators is comprised of leading retailers and installers of floors, carpets, and countertops to consumers, builders, and contractors in California and Nevada. Flooring Liquidators was acquired for a net purchase price of approximately $78.7 million. As part of its purchase price allocation, the Company determined approximately $21 million should be allocated to customer relationship and trade name intangible assets.\nWe identified the Company's valuation of the intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management used in the estimate of the preliminary acquisition date\nfair value, including forecasts of future revenues and expenses and the selection of the discount rates. Auditing management's forecasts of future revenues and expenses as well as the selection of the discount rates involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of our valuation specialists, as changes in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the acquired intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment.\nOur audit procedures related to the Company's estimate of the preliminary acquisition date fair value of the intangible assets and property, plant, and equipment included the following, among others:\nWe read the purchase agreements to understand and evaluate the terms of the transaction to determine that the acquisition met the requirements of a business combination.\nWe evaluated the analysis of the initial allocation of the purchase price accounting as well as the determination of the balance sheet classification of each component of the transaction.\nWe obtained the Company's third-party expert valuation report to gain an understanding of the processes and key assumptions for estimating the fair value of intangible assets and other acquired assets and liabilities.\nWe utilized our valuation specialists to evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of the methodologies and assumptions, including the weighted-average cost of capital and the discount rate, used by the Company's third-party valuation expert in developing the estimated fair value of the intangible assets, property, plant, and equipment, and other assets and liabilities.\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management's cash flow forecasts based on historical results, revenue growth assumptions and expected inflation.\nWe performed independent calculations to test the reasonableness and mathematical accuracy of the fair values concluded on by the Company.\nWe evaluated the qualifications of the Company's third-party valuation expert based on credentials, reputation and experience.\nWe assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2021.\n/s/ Frazier & Deeter, LLC\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 22, 2023\nLIVE VENTURES INCORPORATED\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(dollars in thousands)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\nAssets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 4,309 $ 4,600\nTrade receivables, net\n41,194 25,665\nInventories, net\n131,314 97,659\nIncome taxes receivable 1,116 4,403\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 4,919 2,477\nTotal current assets 182,852 134,804\nProperty and equipment, net\n80,703 64,590\nRight of use asset -

Live Ventures is a diversified holding company with a strategic focus on value-oriented acquisitions of domestic middle-market companies. The Company has five operating segments: Retail-Entertainment, Retail-Flooring, Flooring Manufacturing, Steel Manufacturing, and Corporate and Other. The Retail-Entertainment segment includes Vintage Stock, Inc. (Vintage Stock), which is engaged in the retail sale of new and used movies, music, collectibles, comics, books, games, game systems and components. The Retail-Flooring segment includes Flooring Liquidators, Inc. (Flooring Liquidators), which is engaged in the retail sale and installation of floors, carpets, and countertops. The Flooring Manufacturing segment includes Marquis Industries, Inc. (Marquis), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of carpet and the sale of vinyl and wood floor coverings. The Steel Manufacturing Segment includes Precision Industries, Inc. (Precision Marshall), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of alloy and steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods, The Kinetic Co., Inc. (Kinetic), which is engaged in the production of industrial knives and hardened wear products for the tissue and metals industries, and Precision Metal Works, Inc. (PMW), which is engaged in metal forming, assembly, and finishing solutions across diverse industries, including appliance, automotive, hardware, electrical, electronic, medical products, and devices. PMW reports on a 13-week quarter, as opposed to the Company's calendar quarter reporting. However, the Company has determined that the difference in reporting periods has no material effect on its reported financial results.\nNote 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its majority owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, and a variable interest entity (VIE). The Company recorded a non-controlling interest within stockholders equity for the portion of the entitys equity attributed to the consolidated entities that are not wholly owned. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the prior period have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications have no material effect on the reported financial results. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company has reclassified approximately $8.2 million from operating activities to financing activities in its consolidated statement of cash flows for the period, which relates to proceeds received from a failed sales and leaseback transaction as part of the Kinetic acquisition (see Note 4). The reclassification decreased fiscal year 2022 cash generated from operating activities from $14.6 million as previously reported to $6.4 million as adjusted. The reclassification has no impact on overall cash flow, net income, or adjusted EBITDA for the year ended September 30, 2022, nor does it have any impact on the Company's financial covenants, or financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nNon-controlling Interest\nThe Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810, Consolidation, which governs the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (NCIs) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss control of subsidiaries. Certain provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that NCIs be treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability, that increases and decreases in the parents ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as an equity transaction rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses, and that losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the NCI even when\nsuch allocation might result in a deficit balance. This standard also required changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements.\nIn July 2020, the Company acquired a 50% interest in HiYield, LLC, a Nevada partnership (HiYield). As of September 30, 2023, the Company had ceased doing business through HiYield, and, consequently, recorded a write-off of the existing NCI balance of approximately $448,000 against paid-in capital.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates made in connection with the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the estimated reserve for doubtful current and long-term trade and other receivables, the estimated reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, fair values in connection with the analysis of goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived assets for impairment, valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, lease terminations, and estimated useful lives for intangible assets and property and equipment.\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments consist primarily of cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, advances to affiliates and obligations under accounts payable, accrued expenses and notes payable. The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, trade receivables and other receivables, leases, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term notes payable approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the long-term debt is calculated based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Companys existing debt arrangements, unless quoted market prices are available (Level 2 inputs). The carrying amounts of long-term debt at September 30, 2023 and 2022 approximate fair value.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase. Fair value of cash equivalents approximates carrying value.\nTrade Receivables\nThe Company grants trade credit to customers under credit terms that it believes are customary in the industries in which it operates and does not require collateral to support customer trade receivables. Some of the Companys trade receivables are factored primarily through two factors. Factored trade receivables are sold without recourse for substantially all of the receivables balances for credit approved accounts. The factor purchases the trade receivable(s) for the gross amount of the respective invoice(s), less factoring commissions, trade and cash discounts. The factor charges the Company a factoring commission for each trade account, which is between 0.45-0.50% of the gross amount of the invoice(s) factored on the date of the purchase, plus an additional rate of 0.0125% for each credit term extension of 30 days, or portion thereof. The minimum annual commission due the factor is approximately $200,000 per contract year. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the balance of factored trade receivables was approximately $4.3 million and $5.7 million, respectively.\nThe following table details the Company's trade receivables as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 ($000s):\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\nTrade receivables, net:\nAccounts receivable $ 42,762 $ 25,797\nLess: Allowance for doubtful accounts (1,568) (132)\n$ 41,194 $ 25,665\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts, which includes allowances for accounts and factored trade receivables, customer refunds, dilution and fees from local exchange carrier billing aggregators and other uncollectible\naccounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon historical bad debt experience and periodic evaluations of the aging and collectability of the trade receivables. This allowance is maintained at a level which the Company believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and trade receivables are only written off to bad debt expense as uncollectible after all reasonable collection efforts have been made. The Company has also purchased accounts receivable credit insurance to cover some non-factored trade and other receivables which helps reduce potential losses due to doubtful accounts. At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.6 million and $132,000, respectively. The increase is primarily due to the Company recording an allowance against the promissory note with ARCA Recycling, Inc. (ARCA) [see Note 16].\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of the inventorys cost (first in, first out basis or FIFO) or net realizable value of the inventory. Management compares the cost of inventory with its net realizable value and an allowance is made to write down inventory to net realizable value, if lower. Management also reviews inventory to determine if excess or obsolete inventory is present and a reserve is made to reduce the carrying value for inventory for such excess and or obsolete inventory. At years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the inventory reserves were approximately $3.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively.\nThe following table details the Company's inventories as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 ($000s):\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\nInventory, net\nRaw materials $ 32,590 $ 35,829\nWork in progress 9,028 7,539\nFinished goods 50,082 32,814\nMerchandise 43,438 23,900\n135,138 100,082\nLess: Inventory reserves (3,824) (2,423)\n$ 131,314 $ 97,659\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and Equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred and additions and improvements that significantly extend the lives of assets are capitalized. Upon sale or other retirement of depreciable property, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the related accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in operations. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The useful lives of building and improvements are three to 40 years, transportation equipment is five to 10 years, machinery and equipment are three to 10 years, furnishings and fixtures are three to five years, and office and computer equipment are three to five years.\nThe Company periodically reviews its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated. The Company assesses recoverability based on several factors, including its intention with respect to its stores and those stores projected undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value, as approximated by the present value of their projected discounted cash flows.\nGoodwill\nThe Company accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. Under ASC 350, goodwill is not amortized; rather, it is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Goodwill represents the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of underlying identifiable net assets of business acquired.\nThe Company tests goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events arise or circumstances change that indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The Company assesses whether goodwill impairment exists using both qualitative and quantitative assessments. The qualitative assessment involves determining whether events or circumstances exist that indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying\namount, including goodwill. If based on this qualitative assessment the Company determines it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if the Company elects not to perform a qualitative assessment, a quantitative assessment is performed, as required by ASC 350, to determine whether a goodwill impairment exists.\nThe quantitative test is used to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit's assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. An impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill. The determination of the fair value of the Company's reporting units is based, among other things, on estimates of the future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued. A goodwill impairment test is required to be completed, at minimum, once annually, and any resulting impairment loss recorded upon completion of the assessment. Changes in market conditions, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates and require interim impairment assessments.\nWhen performing the two-step quantitative impairment test, the Company's methodology includes the use of an income approach which discounts future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects the Company's cost of capital, otherwise known as the discounted cash flow method (DCF). These estimated fair values are based on estimates of future cash flows of the businesses. Factors affecting these future cash flows include the continued market acceptance of the products and services offered by the businesses, the development of new products and services by the businesses and the underlying cost of development, the future cost structure of the businesses, and future technological changes. The Company also incorporates market multiples for comparable companies in determining the fair value of our reporting units. Any such impairment would be recognized in full in the reporting period in which it has been identified.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Companys intangible assets consist of customer relationship intangibles, favorable leases, trade names, licenses for the use of internet domain names, Universal Resource Locators, or URLs, software, and marketing and technology related intangibles. Upon acquisition, estimates are made in valuing acquired intangible assets, which include but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; tradename and market position, as well as assumptions about the period of time that customer relationships will continue; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from the assumptions used in determining the fair values. All intangible assets are capitalized at their original cost and amortized over their estimated useful lives as follows: domain name and marketing - three to 20 years; software - three to 5 years, customer relationships - seven to 10 years, favorable leases - over the life of the lease, customer lists up to 20 years, trade names up to 20 years.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nThe Company accounts for its sales revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Topic 606 provides a five-step revenue recognition model that is applied to the Companys customer contracts. Under this model we (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify our performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price for the contract, (iv) allocate the transaction price to our performance obligations and (v) recognize revenue when or as we satisfy our performance obligations.\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of the promised goods or the performance of the services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be receive in exchange for those goods or services. The Company enters into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.\nRetail - Entertainment Segment\nThe Retail-Entertainment Segment derives revenue primarily from direct sales of entertainment products. Sales are generally of a cash-and-carry nature, and contain a single performance obligation. Consequently, revenue is recorded at the point in time in which the sale is made. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes collected from customers.\nRetail - Flooring Segment\nThe Retail-Flooring Segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of flooring products and installation services, which are recognized at the point-of-sale and over time, respectively. Retail sales are generally of a cash-and-carry nature, and\ncontain a single performance obligation. Consequently, revenue is recorded at the point in time in which the sale is made. Installation services generally contain multiple performance obligations requiring revenue to be recognized over a period of time based on percentage of completion. All direct costs are either paid and or accrued for in the period in which the sale is recorded. Revenues are recorded net of sales taxes collected from customers. For the year ended September 30, 2023, revenue for retail and installation services sales was approximately $59.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively.\nFlooring and Steel Manufacturing Segments\nThe Flooring Manufacturing Segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of carpet and hard surface flooring products, including shipping and handling amounts. The Steel Manufacturing Segments derives revenue primarily from the sale of steel plates, ground flat stock and drill rods, and tooling, including shipping and handling amounts. Revenue for these segments generally contain a single performance obligation and is recognized at the point title passes to the customer. At the time revenue is recognized, the Company records a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based primarily on historical experience and any known trends or conditions that exist at the time revenue is recognized. Revenues are recorded net of taxes collected from customers. All direct costs are either paid and or accrued for in the period in which the sale is recorded.\nSpare Parts\nFor spare parts sales, the Company transfers control and recognizes a sale when it ships the product to the customer or when the customer receives product based upon agreed shipping terms. Each unit sold is considered an independent, unbundled performance obligation. The Company has no additional performance obligations other than spare parts sales that are material in the context of the contract. The amount of consideration received and revenue recognized varies due to sales incentives and returns offered to customers. When customers retain the right to return eligible products, the Company reduces revenue for the estimate of the expected returns, which is primarily based on an analysis of historical experience.\nShipping and Handling\nThe Company classifies shipping and handling charged to customers as revenues and classifies costs relating to shipping and handling as cost of revenues.\nCustomer Liabilities\nThe Company recognizes the portion of the dollar value of prepaid stored-value products that ultimately is unredeemed (breakage) in accordance with ASU 2016-04 Liabilities- Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products.\nBecause the Company expects to be entitled to a breakage amount for a liability resulting from the sale of a prepaid stored-value product, the Company utilized the Redemption Pattern methodology. Under this methodology, the Company shall derecognize the amount related to the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the recognized breakage amount will not subsequently occur.\nThe Company establishes a liability upon the issuance of merchandise credits and the sale of gift cards. Breakage income related to gift cards which are no longer reportable under state escheatment laws of approximately $12,000 and $65,000 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, is recorded in other income in our consolidated financial statements.\nAdvertising Expense\nAdvertising expense is charged to operations as incurred. Advertising expense totaled approximately $1.0 million and $445,000 for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is due to the acquisition of Flooring Liquidators, as well as increased advertising costs among the Company's other subsidiaries.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows: Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or\nindirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of inventory acquired as part of a business combination is based on a three-part valuation utilizing the comparable sales method which is based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. The comparative sales method utilizes the actual or expected selling prices of finished goods to customers in the ordinary course of business as the base amount that must be adjusted for factors that are generally relevant in determining the Fair Value of the inventory including:\nthe time that would be required to dispose of this inventory;\nthe expenses that would be expected to be incurred in the disposition; and\na profit commensurate with the amount of investment in the assets and the degree of risk.\nThe fair value of property, plant and equipment, and goodwill acquired as part of a business combination is based on a third-party valuation utilizing the indirect method of cost approach which is based on Level 2 and Level 3 inputs. In the indirect method of Cost Approach, the Reproduction Cost New for each asset or group of assets is determined by indexing the original capitalized cost basis. The cost basis generally includes the base cost of the asset and certain contributory costs, such as sales tax, freight and handling charges, installation, general contractors costs, and engineering and design costs. The index factors used in this analysis are based on the asset type and manufacture date. Index factors were derived from various published sources including Marshall Valuation Service and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\nThe fair value of debt assumed as part of a business combination is discounted utilizing implied interest rates, as applicable, which is based on Level 1 and Level 2 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of the Companys assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided on deferred taxes if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes penalties and interest accrued related to income tax liabilities in the provision for income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of (Loss) Income.\nSignificant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in relation to an uncertain tax position. The Company uses a two-step process to evaluate tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. The second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Company in future periods.\nLease Accounting\nThe Company leases retail stores, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, and office space. These assets and properties are generally leased under noncancelable agreements that expire at various dates through 2054 with various renewal options for additional periods. The agreements, which are classified as either operating or finance leases, generally provide for minimum and, in some cases percentage rent and require it to pay all insurance, taxes and other maintenance costs.\nFor contracts entered into on or after October 1, 2019, the Company assesses at contract inception whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. Generally, it determines that a lease exists when (i) the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) obtains the right to substantially all economic benefits from use of the asset and (iii) it has the right to direct the use of the asset.\nAt the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases, except short-term leases with an original term of 12 months or less. The right-of-use asset represents the right to use the leased asset for the lease term. The lease liability represents the present value of the lease payments under the lease. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which primarily comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any prepayments to the lessor and initial direct costs, such as brokerage commissions, less any lease incentives received. All\nright-of-use assets are periodically reviewed for impairment in accordance with standards that apply to long-lived assets. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments, discounted using an estimate of the Companys incremental borrowing rate for a collateralized loan with the same term as the underlying lease. The incremental borrowing rates used for the initial measurement of lease liabilities as of October 1, 2019 were based on the original lease terms.\nLease payments included in the measurement of lease liabilities consist of (i) fixed lease payments for the noncancelable lease term, (ii) fixed lease payments for optional renewal periods where it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised, and (iii) variable lease payments that depend on an underlying index or rate, based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Certain of the Companys real estate lease agreements require variable lease payments that do not depend on an underlying index or rate, such as sales and value-added taxes, the Companys proportionate share of actual property taxes, insurance, common area maintenance, and utilities. The Company has elected an accounting policy, as permitted by ASC 842, not to account for such payments as part of related lease payments. Consequently, such payments are recognized as operating expenses when incurred.\nLease expense for operating leases consists of the fixed lease payments recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term plus variable lease payments as incurred. Amortization of the right-of-use asset for operating leases reflects amortization of the lease liability, any differences between straight-line expense and related lease payments during the accounting period, and any impairments. Finance lease payments are allocated between a reduction of the lease liability and interest expense, and the related asset is depreciated as described under Property and Equipment above.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company from time to time grants restricted stock awards and options to employees, non-employees and Company executives and directors. Such awards are valued based on the grant date fair-value of the instruments. The value of each award is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings Per share. Under ASC 260 basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, except that it does not include unvested restricted stock subject to cancellation. Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of warrants, options, restricted shares and convertible preferred stock. The dilutive effect of outstanding restricted shares, options and warrants is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. Convertible preferred stock is reflected on an if-converted basis.\nSegment Reporting\nASC Topic 280, Segment Reporting, requires use of the management approach model for segment reporting. The management approach model is based on the way a Companys management organizes segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company determined it has five operating segments (See Note 19).\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company maintains cash balances in bank accounts in each state the Company has business operations. The Company places its cash with high quality financial institutions. Accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to $250,000 per institution as of September 30, 2023. At times, balances may exceed federally insured limits. As of September 30, 2023, the Company had approximately $1.6 million of cash with financial institutions in excess of FDIC insurance limits.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which introduces a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments based on expected losses instead of incurred losses. It also modified the impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities and provided a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration since their origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021 and the interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has\nadopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU has had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04 - Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), codified as ASC 848 (ASC 848). The purpose of ASC 848 is to provide optional guidance to ease the potential effects on financial reporting of the market-wide migration away from Interbank Offered Rates to alternative reference rates. ASC 848 applies only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference a reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Effective December 31, 2021, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) replaced the USD London Interbank-Offered Rate (LIBOR) for most financial benchmarking. The guidance may be applied upon issuance of ASC 848 through December 31, 2022. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU has had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Issuers Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call Options. This update provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. This update is effective for the Companys fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The Company has adopted this new accounting standard on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures; however, adoption of this ASU has had no material impact on the Company's financial statements.\nNote 3: Variable Interest Entity\nIn May 2023, the Company shut down the operations and deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of SW Financial. The Company recognized a loss on deconsolidation of SW Financial's assets and liabilities of approximately $1.7 million, as detailed in the table below (in $000s):\nAccounts payable $ 242\nLease liabilities 728\nTotal deconsolidation of liabilities 970\nCash 187\nAccounts receivable 130\nOther current assets 187\nIntangible assets\nCustomer Relationships 1,348\nTradenames 72\nSubtotal Intangible Assets 1,420\nRight-of-use assets 687\nOther assets 55\nTotal deconsolidation of assets 2,666\nTotal loss on deconsolidation $ (1,696)\nIn connection with the shutdown, on March 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (Agreement I) with Angia Holdings, LLC and Thomas Diamante and Lawrence Zelin (Principals). Agreement I stipulated that the Principals would pay the Company $1,000,000 within 10 days of the effective date of Agreement I, and an additional $1,000,000 within 45 days of the effective date of Agreement I if a joint venture, with terms acceptable to the Company, was not formed. The Principals made the initial $1,000,000 payment in April 2023, and, having failed to form a joint venture, made the second $1,000,000 payment in May 2023. The Company recorded a gain on receipt of the settlement amounts of $2,000,000\nOn August 30, 2023, the Company entered into a second Agreement with Angia Holdings, LLC and its Principals (Agreement II). Agreement II stipulated that the Principals would pay the Company and additional $1.5 million, of\nwhich $750,000 was received and recognized as income as of September 30, 2023. The remaining $750,000 will be recognized into income upon receipt.\nNote 4: Acquisitions\nAcquisition of QEP\nOn September 20, 2023, Marquis acquired the Harris Flooring Group\u00ae brands from Q.E.P., a designer, manufacturer, and distributor of a broad range of best-in-class flooring and installation solutions for commercial and home improvement projects. Specifically, Marquis acquired the Harris Flooring Group brands, inventory, and book of business and intends to retain all sales representatives. The purchase price was $10.1 million, consisting of $3.0 million in cash at close, and the recording of a deferred payment of $5.1 million and holdback of $2.0 million. The acquisition was determined to be an asset acquisition for accounting purposes. The entirety of the purchase was allocated to inventory.\nAcquisition of PMW\nOn July 20, 2023 (Effective Date), the Company acquired PMW, a Kentucky-based Metal Stamping and Value-Added Manufacturing Company. PMW was acquired for total consideration of approximately $28 million, comprised of a $25 million purchase price, plus closing cash, and subject to working capital adjustments, with additional consideration of up to $3 million paid in the form of an earn-out. The purchase price was funded in part by a $2.5 million seller note, borrowings under a credit facility of $14.4 million, and proceeds under a sale and leaseback transaction of approximately $8.6 million. The acquisition involved no issuance of stock of the Company.\nAs of the Effective Date, the Company entered into a sales and leaseback transaction for two properties acquired, one located in Frankfort, Kentucky, and the other located in Louisville, Kentucky, with Legacy West Kentucky Portfolio, LLC (Lessor). The aggregate sales price of the Real Estate was approximately $14.5 million. The Louisville, Kentucky property was acquired on the Effective Date for $5.1 million in connection with an option of the Acquired Company to purchase that property.\nThe provisions of each of the two lease agreements include a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. The base rent under the Frankfort lease agreement is $34,977 per month for the first year of the term and a 2% per annum escalator thereafter. The base rent under the Louisville lease agreement is $63,493 per month for the first year of the term and a 2% per annum escalator thereafter. Both Lease Agreements are net leases, such that the lessees are also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the Real Property incurred by the lessor. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes it is more likely than not that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The proceeds of $14.5 million, net of closing fees, from the sale-leaseback were used to assist in funding the acquisition of PMW.\nThe fair value of the purchase price components outlined above was $26.8 million due to fair value adjustments for the contingent consideration, cash acquired, and working capital adjustments, as detailed below (in $000's):\nPurchase price $ 25,000\nFair value of earnout 2,675\nCash from balance sheet 1,602\nWorking capital adjustment (2,500)\nNet purchase price $ 26,777\nUnder the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $4.7 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their estimates of fair value available as of July 20, 2023, as calculated by an independent third-party firm. Because the transaction was considered a stock purchase for tax purposes, none of the goodwill arising from the acquisition will deductible for tax purposes. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for PMW to the acquired identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and goodwill (in $000s):\nNet purchase price $ 26,777\nAccounts payable 10,788\nAccrued liabilities 5,771\nTotal liabilities assumed 16,559\nTotal consideration 43,336\nCash 1,602\nAccounts receivable 12,613\nInventory 6,390\nProperty, plant and equipment 13,616\nIntangible assets 3,600\nOther assets 849\nTotal assets acquired 38,670\nTotal goodwill $ 4,666\nProforma Information\nThe table below presents selected proforma information for the Company for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, assuming that the acquisition had occurred on October 1, 2021 (the beginning of the Companys 2022 fiscal year), pursuant to ASC 805-10-50. This proforma information does not purport to represent what the actual results of operations of the Company would have been had the acquisition occurred on that date, nor does it purport to predict the results of operations for future periods (in $000s).\nYear Ended September 30, 2023 As Reported Adjustments Proforma\nLive (1)\nPMW (2)\nAdjustments (3)\nTotal\nNet revenue $ 355,171 $ 63,136 $ 418,307\nNet income $ (102) $ 462 $ (2,623) $ (2,263)\nEarnings per basic common share $ (0.03) $ (0.72)\nEarnings per basic diluted share $ (0.03) $ (0.72)\nYear Ended September 30, 2022 As Reported Adjustments Proforma\nLive (4)\nPMW (5)\nAdjustments (3)\nTotal\nNet revenue $ 286,913 $ 78,606 $ 365,519\nNet income $ 24,741 $ 4,792 $ (3,264) $ 26,269\nEarnings per basic common share $ 7.94 $ 8.43\nEarnings per basic diluted share $ 7.84 $ 8.32\n(1)Live for the year ended September 30, 2023.

(Cal Coast), and its Shareholders, which was effected through two Asset Purchase Agreements (Agreement, or collectively, Agreements). No liabilities were assumed as part of either transaction. The purchase price for the fixed assets acquired from Cal Coast was $35,000, and the intangible assets acquired from the Shareholders was approximately $1.265 million, for a total combined purchase price of $1.3 million. The intangible assets acquired were comprised of customer relationships, trade name, and non-compete agreements. The acquisition was determined to be an asset\nacquisition for accounting purposes and, as such, no goodwill was recorded as part of the transaction. The values assigned to the assets acquired are based on their estimates of fair value available as of June 2, 2023, as calculated by management.\nThe table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Cal Coast to the acquired identifiable assets (in $000s):\nProperty, plant and equipment $ 35\nIntangible assets\nCustomer relationships 785\nTrade name 425\nNon-compete agreement 55\nTotal intangible assets 1,265\nTotal assets acquired $ 1,300\nAcquisition of Flooring Liquidators\nOn January 18, 2023, Live Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests (the Equity Interests) of Flooring Liquidators, Inc., Elite Builder Services, Inc., 7 Day Stone, Inc., Floorable, LLC, K2L Leasing, LLC, and SJ & K Equipment, Inc. (collectively, the Acquired Companies). The Acquired Companies are leading retailers and installers of floors, carpets, and countertops to consumers, builders and contractors in California and Nevada.\nThe acquisition was effected pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with an effective date of January 18, 2023 by and among the Company, and Stephen J. Kellogg, as the seller representative of the equity holders of the Acquired Companies and individually in his capacity as an equity holder of the Acquired Companies, and the other equity holders of the Acquired Companies (collectively, the Seller). The purchase price for the Equity Interests was $83.8 million before any fair value considerations, and is comprised of the following:\n$41.8 million in cash to the Seller;\n$34.0 million (the Note Amount) to certain trusts for the benefit of Kellogg and members of his family (the Kellogg Trusts) pursuant to the issuance by the Company of a subordinated promissory note (the Note) in favor of the Kellogg Trusts;\n$4.0 million to the Kellogg 2022 Family Irrevocable Nevada Trust by issuance of 116,441 shares of Company Common Stock (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) (the Share Amount), calculated in the manner described in the Purchase Agreement;\n$2.0 million holdback; and\n$2.0 million of contingent consideration, comprised of $1.0 million in cash and $1.0 million in restricted stock units.\nThe fair value the purchase price components outlined above was $78.7 million due to fair value adjustments for the Note and restricted stock, as detailed below (in $000's):.\nPurchase price $ 83,800\nFair value adjustment, sellers note (3,300)\nFair value adjustment, restricted stock (1,800)\nNet purchase price $ 78,700\nUnder the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $30.4 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired. The values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on their estimates of fair value available as of January 18, 2023, as calculated by an independent third-party firm. The Company anticipates approximately $13.4 million of the goodwill arising from the acquisition to be fully deductible for tax purposes.

No liabilities were assumed as part of the acquisition. The purchase price, which is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, was approximately $3.2 million, which is comprised of $1.8 million that was paid upon closing, and the $1.4 million present value of $1.5 million of non-compete payments to be made over a 24-month period. In order to expedite the transaction, the acquisition was originally made by Live, and the $1.8 million paid upon closing was funded with borrowings under the Lives credit line with Isaac Capital Group, LLC (ICG). On August 18, 2022, Marquis repaid the $1.8 million to ICG and assumed ownership of Better Backers.\nIn connection with the acquisition, Marquis entered into two 20-year building leases with Spyglass Estate Planning, LLC, a related party (see Note 16), with two options to renew for an additional five years each. The fair value of the buildings and improvement is approximately $9.3 million. The provisions of the lease agreements include an initial 24-month month-to-month rental period, during which the lessee may cancel with 90-day notice, followed by a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, Marquis currently believes that it is unlikely that it will cancel during the initial 24-month term, and that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The base rent under the lease agreements is approximately $73,000 and $32,000 per month, respectively, for the first year of the term, and a 2.5% per annum escalator. The lease agreements are each net leases, such that the lessee is also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the property. The Company has evaluated each lease and determined the rent amounts to be at market rates. These leases are being treated as finance leases for accounting purposes, as described in ASC 842 Leases.\nUnder the purchase price allocation, no goodwill was recognized. The values assigned to the assets acquired are based on their estimates of fair value available as of July 1, 2022, as calculated by management. The table below outlines the purchase price allocation of the purchase for Better Backers to the acquired identifiable assets (in $000s):\nTotal purchase price $ 3,166\nInventory 748\nProperty, plant and equipment 2,118\nIntangible assets 300\nTotal assets acquired 3,166\nAcquisition of Kinetic\nOn June 28, 2022, Precision Marshall acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of The Kinetic Co., Inc. (Kinetic), a Wisconsin corporation, which was accomplished through a Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement). In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Precision Marshall also entered into a Real Estate Purchase Agreement with Plant B-6, LLC, an affiliate of Kinetic, pursuant to which Precision Marshall received all of Kinetic's right, title, and interest in and to the land and improvements (collectively, the Real Estate) that Kinetic uses in its operations. The combined purchase price for the Kinetic shares and Real Estate was approximately $24.7 million, which was funded with approximately $11.0 million in borrowings under the companys credit facility, approximately $8.3 million in proceeds from a failed sale and leaseback of the Real Estate, a subordinated promissory note in the amount of $3.0 million for the benefit of the Seller of Kinetic, $1.7 million of cash on-hand, a contingent earn-out liability valued at $997,000, and a working capital adjustment of approximately $400,000, which was paid in cash and a final fair value adjustment of approximately $312,000, which was noncash. The sale of the Real Estate was determined to be a failed sales and leaseback because the transaction did not meet the criteria for sales accounting as prescribed under ASC 842 Leases. Consequently, the transaction was treated as a financing transaction.\nAs of the date of acquisition, Precision Marshall entered into a sale and leaseback agreement with a third-party, independent of the Kinetic sellers, for the Real Estate. The sale price of the Real Estate was approximately $8.9 million, subject to closing fees of approximately $547,000.\nThe provisions of the lease agreement include a 20-year lease term with two five-year renewal options. The base rent under the lease agreement is $600,000 for the first year of the term and a 2% per annum escalator. The Lease Agreement is a net lease, such that the lessees are also obligated to pay all taxes, insurance, assessments, and other costs, expenses, and obligations of ownership of the Real Property incurred by the lessor. Due to the highly specialized nature of the leased assets, the Company currently believes that it is more likely than not that each of the two five-year options will be exercised. The proceeds, net of closing fees, from the sale-leaseback were used to assist in funding the acquisition of Kinetic.\nUnder the purchase price allocation, the Company recognized goodwill of approximately $3.0 million, which is calculated as the excess of both the consideration exchanged and liabilities assumed as compared to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired.

The subpoena requested documents and information concerning, among other things, the restatement of the Companys financial statements for the quarterly periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, the acquisition of Marquis Industries, Inc., Vintage Stock, Inc., and ApplianceSmart, Inc., and the change in auditors. On August 12, 2020, three of the Companys corporate executive officers (together, the Executives) each received a Wells Notice from the Staff of the SEC relating to the Companys SEC investigation. On October 7, 2020, the Company received a Wells Notice from the Staff of the SEC relating to the SEC investigation. The Wells Notices related to, among other things, the Companys reporting of its financial performance for its fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, certain disclosures related to executive compensation, and its previous acquisition of ApplianceSmart, Inc. A Wells Notice is neither a formal charge of wrongdoing nor a final determination that the recipient has violated any law. The Wells Notices informed the Company and the Executives that the SEC Staff had made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against the Company and each of the Executives to allege certain violations of the federal securities laws. On October 1, 2018, the Company received a letter from the SEC requesting information regarding a potential violation of Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, based upon the timing of the Companys Form 8-K filed on February 14, 2018. The Company cooperated fully with the SEC inquiry and provided a response to the SEC on October 26, 2018.\nOn August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers\u2009-\u2009Jon Isaac, the Companys current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the Company Defendants) as well as certain other related third parties (the SEC Complaint). The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share data, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, purported inaccurate disclosure regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Company Defendants, permanent officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third-party defendants moved to dismiss the SEC complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants motion to dismiss, but granted one of the third-party defendants motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. The court subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. The parties participated in a mediation in June 2023. The mediation was not successful and the case is currently in the midst of discovery. Discovery deadlines have been extended because counsel for JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson moved to withdraw on August 18, 2023, which motion the court granted on October 2, 2023. JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson have until January 4, 2024, to obtain new counsel, after which time the Company anticipates depositions will commence.\nThe Company Defendants strongly dispute and deny the allegations and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against the claims.\nSieggreen Class Action\nOn August 13, 2021, Daniel E. Sieggreen, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated claimants (\"Plaintiff\"), filed a class action complaint for violation of federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, naming the Company, Jon Isaac, the Company's current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the \"Company Defendants\"). The allegations asserted are similar to those in the SEC Complaint. Among other sought relief, the complaint seeks damages in connection with the purchases and sales of the Companys securities between December 28, 2016 and August 3, 2021. As of December 17, 2021, the judge granted a stipulation to stay proceedings pending the resolutions of the motions to dismiss in the SEC Complaint. On February 1, 2023, the final motion to dismiss relating to the SEC Complaint was denied, which was subsequently noticed in the Sieggreen action on February 2, 2023. Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 6, 2023. On May 5, 2023, the Company Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, and the briefing on that motion is now complete. Discovery is automatically stayed in this case until after the disposition of the Motion to Dismiss. If the Motion to Dismiss is not successful, the case will proceed to discovery. The Company Defendants strongly dispute and deny the allegations at issue in this case and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against these claims.\nApplianceSmart Bankruptcy and Other ApplianceSmart Litigation Matters\nOn Feb 28, 2022, the court approved ApplianceSmarts plan for reorganization (the Plan), discharging ApplianceSmart of certain debts according to the Plan resulting in the Company recording a gain of approximately $11.4 million, which includes a write-off or adjustment of approximately $11.5 million on the settlement of debts and other liabilities, offset by payments subject to the bankruptcy that were not included as debtor-in-possession liabilities of approximately $149,000. As of April 1, 2022, the Company has ceased operations at its one existing location, and is in the process of winding down operations, which will be immaterial to the financial statements.\nSieggreen Class Action\nOn August 13, 2021, Daniel E. Sieggreen, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated claimants (\"Plaintiff\"), filed a class action complaint for violation of federal securities laws in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, naming the Company, Jon Isaac, the Company's current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the \"Company Defendants\"). The allegations asserted are similar to those in the SEC Complaint. Among other sought relief, the complaint seeks damages in connection with the purchases and sales of the Companys securities between December 28, 2016 and August 3, 2021. As of December 17, 2021, the judge granted a stipulation to stay proceedings pending the resolutions of the motions to dismiss in the SEC Complaint. On February 1, 2023, the final motion to dismiss relating to the SEC Complaint was denied, which was subsequently noticed in the Sieggreen action on February 2, 2023. Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on March 6, 2023. On May 5, 2023, the Company Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, and the briefing on that motion is now complete. Discovery is automatically stayed in this case until after the disposition of the Motion to Dismiss. If the Motion to Dismiss is not successful, the case will proceed to discovery. The Company Defendants strongly dispute and deny the allegations at issue in this case and intend to continue to defend themselves vigorously against these claims.\nHoldback Matter\nOn October 10, 2022, a representative for the former shareholders of Precision Industries, Inc. filed a civil complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. The complaint alleged that the Company violated the terms of an agreement and plan of merger dated July 14, 2020, by failing to pay the shareholders a certain indemnity holdback of\n$2,500,000. The Chancery Court dismissed that action for lack of jurisdiction. On January 12, 2023, the representative re-filed the same action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. On October 26, 2023, the Company counterclaimed against the representative and all represented shareholders for fraudulently misrepresenting the sellers inventory and accounting methodology and asserting damages in excess of $4,500,000. The Company expects discovery to last for approximately one year.\nWage and Hour Matter\nOn July 27, 2022, Irma Sanchez, a former employee of Elite Builder Services, Inc. (Elite Builders), filed a class action complaint against Elite Builders in the Superior Court of California, County of Alameda. The complaint alleges that Elite Builders failed to pay all minimum and overtime wages, failed to provide lawful meal periods and rest breaks, failed to provide accurate itemized wage statements, and failed to pay all wages due upon separation as required by California law. The complaint was later amended as a matter of right on October 4, 2022. Further, Ms. Sanchez has put the Labor & Workforce Development Agency on notice to exhaust administrative remedies and enable her to bring an additional claim under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, which permits an employee to assert a claim for violations of certain California Labor Code provisions on behalf of all aggrieved employees to recover statutory penalties. The court granted Elite Builders Motion to Change Venue to Stanislaus County and Stanislaus County has now processed the filing and has set a Case Management Conference for January 16, 2024. The Company believes that Ms. Sanchezs claims lack merit and intends to defend this action vigorously. The Company is currently unable to estimate the range of possible losses associated with this proceeding as we are in the early stages of discovery and the scope of class is not yet known.\nGenerally\nThe Company is involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business. The ultimate results of claims and litigation cannot be predicted with certainty. The Company currently believes that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually, or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As applicable, liabilities pertaining to these matters, that are probable and estimable, have been accrued.\nNote 18: Income Taxes\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nIncome tax expense for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is as follows (in $000s):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nCurrent expense:\nFederal $ 3,821 $ 524\nState 603 329\n4,424 853\nDeferred (benefit) expense:\nFederal (2,228) 5,051\nState (625) 971\n(2,853) 6,022\nTotal income tax expense $ 1,571 $ 6,875\nA reconciliation of the differences between the effective and statutory income tax rates for years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2023 Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\nFederal statutory rates 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 5.9 % 4.0 %\nPermanent differences (2.9 %) 3.2 %\nTransaction costs\n27.9 % - %\nInvestments\n(71.9) % - %\nBankruptcy gain exclusion - % (9.0 %)\nStock compensation 4.9 % 3.8 %\nChange in tax rates\n41.4 % - %\nTax credits\n(3.1 %) - %\nChange in valuation allowance 73.4 % (0.2) %\nOther 0.4 % (1.0 %)\nEffective rate 97.0 % 21.8 %\nAt September 30, 2023 and 2022, deferred income tax assets and liabilities were comprised of (in $000s):\nSeptember 30,\n2023 September 30,\nDeferred income tax assets (liabilities):\nAllowance for bad debts $ 167 $ 53\nAccrued expenses/reserves\n(25) (172)\nInventory 1,841 1,132\nAccrued compensation 180 150\nResearch and development\n121 -\nNet operating loss 2,321 508\nTax credits 499 475\nStock compensation 235 265\nIntangibles (7,273) (2,952)\nProperty & equipment (12,681) (8,843)\nRight of use assets (13,933) (8,817)\nLease liabilities 15,256 9,609\nInterest carryforwards\n1,452 -\nInvestments\n253 560\nCapital loss carryforwards\n1,156 -\nLess: Valuation allowance (3,604) (786)\nTotal deferred income tax (liability)\n$ (14,035) $ (8,818)\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $7.8 million and $10.8 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2023. The Company has placed a valuation allowance of approximately $7.0 million on the federal net operating loss carryforward due to Sec. 382 limitations. Additionally, the Company has placed a full valuation allowance against their state net operating loss carryforwards due to Sec. 382 and separate return limitations. The Company has Sec. 163(j) interest carryforwards of approximately $5.1 million as of September 30, 2023, which have an indefinite carryforward period. The Company has state tax credit carryforwards as of September 30, 2023 of approximately $0.6 million.\nThe Company evaluates all available evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is needed to reduce its deferred tax assets. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a portion of its existing tax benefits will not be\nrealized. Accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of approximately $3.6 million at September 30, 2023 to reduce its deferred tax assets.\nThe Company annually conducts an analysis of its tax positions and has concluded that it has no uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2023. The Company is not under examination in any jurisdiction as of September 30, 2023. The 2019 through 2022 tax years are open to examination by the various federal and state jurisdictions in which the Company operates.The Companys policy is to record uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nNote 19: Segment Reporting\nThe Company operates in five operating segments which are characterized as: (1) Retail-Entertainment, (2) Retail-Flooring, (3) Flooring Manufacturing, (4) Steel Manufacturing, and (5) Corporate and Other.

As of the date of filing of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K, the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed had not yet been determined, and, thus, are not presented.\nVintage Credit Facility Refinance\nOn October 17, 2023, Vintage entered into a $15.0 million credit agreement with Bank Midwest, replacing a revolving credit facility between Vintage and Texas Capital Bank, which was entered into in November 2016 and set to mature in November 2023. In connection with the entry into the Credit Agreement, the revolving credit facility between Vintage Stock and Texas Capital Bank was terminated. The facility interest accrues daily on the outstanding principal at a rate of the greater of (a) the one-month forward-looking term rate based on SOFR, plus 2.36% per annum, or (b) 6.50% per annum, and matures on October 17, 2024. ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures\nNone. ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure control and Procedures. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision, and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Based upon that evaluation, as of September 30, 2023, we concluded that the Company's disclosure, controls, and procedures were effective.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management, including the Companys CEO and CFO, do not expect that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures or the Companys internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system will be met. These inherent limitations include the following: judgements in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes, controls can be circumvented by individuals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.\nOur management assessed the design and effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) of 2013 regarding Internal Control - Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment using those criteria, as of September 30, 2023, our management (with the participation of the Companys CEO and CFO) under the oversight of the Board of Directors, concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective at the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit us to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the year ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Tony Isaac does not receive any compensation from the Company other than compensation equivalent to that paid to the independent members of the Board.\nInvolvement in Certain Legal Proceedings\nTo the best of our knowledge, there have been no events under any bankruptcy act, no criminal proceedings and no judgments, injunctions, orders, or decrees material to the evaluation of the ability and integrity of any director during the past ten years other than the following: (i) filing by ApplianceSmart, Inc., of a voluntary petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York seeking relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code, at which time Jon Isaac was serving as its President, Chief Executive Officer, and director, and Virland Johnson, our former Chief Financial Officer, was serving as a director of ApplianceSmart, Inc., from which it emerged on February, 28, 2022; and, (ii) a civil complaint filed by the SEC naming the Company, Jon Isaac, Tony Isaac, and the Companys then-CFO, Virland Johnson, among other parties, as defendants (see below for more information).\nSEC Investigation\nOn August 2, 2021, the SEC filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada naming the Company and two of its executive officers\u2009-\u2009Jon Isaac, the Companys current President and Chief Executive Officer, and Virland Johnson, the Companys former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants (collectively, the Company Defendants) as well as certain other related third parties (the SEC Complaint). The SEC Complaint alleges various financial, disclosure, and reporting violations related to income and earnings per share data, purported undisclosed stock promotion and trading, purported inaccurate disclosure regarding beneficial ownership of common stock, and undisclosed executive compensation from 2016 through 2018. The violations are brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \"Exchange Act\") and Rule 10b-5; Sections 13(a), 13(b)(2)(B) and 13(b)(5) of the Exchange Act and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, 13a-14, 13a-13, 13b2-1, 13b2-2; Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14a-3; and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933. The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the Company Defendants, permanent officer-and-director bars, disgorgement of profits, and civil penalties. The foregoing is only a general summary of the SEC Complaint, which may be accessed on the SECs website at https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2021/lr25155.htm.\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company Defendants and third-party defendants moved to dismiss the SEC complaint. On September 7, 2022, the court denied the Company Defendants motion to dismiss, but granted one of the third-party defendants motions to dismiss, granting the SEC leave to file an amended complaint. On September 21, 2022, the SEC filed an amended complaint to which the Company Defendants filed an answer on October 11, 2022, denying liability. The\ncourt subsequently entered a discovery scheduling order and the parties exchanged initial disclosures. The parties participated in a mediation in June 2023. The mediation was not successful and the case is currently in the midst of discovery. Discovery deadlines have been extended because counsel for JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson moved to withdraw on August 18, 2023, which motion the court granted on October 2, 2023. JanOne Inc. and Virland Johnson have until January 4, 2024, to obtain new counsel, after which time the Company anticipates depositions will commence.\nBoard Independence\nThe Company is required by Nasdaq listing standards to have a majority of independent directors. Each year, the Board reviews the relationships that each director has with the Company and with other parties to determine whether each director qualifies as an independent director under Nasdaq listing standards and applicable rules of the SEC. Only those directors who do not have any of the categorical relationships that preclude them from being independent within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules and whom the Board affirmatively determines have no relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director are considered to be independent directors. The Board reviewed a number of factors to evaluate the independence of each of its members. These factors include its members current and historic relationships with the Company and its competitors, suppliers, and customers; their relationships with management and other directors; the relationships their current and former employers have with the Company; and the relationships between the Company and other companies of which a member of the Companys Board of Directors is a director or executive officer.\nAfter evaluating these factors, the Board of Directors has determined that a majority of the members of the Board, namely Messrs. Butler, Gao, and Sickmeyer, do not have any relationships that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out their responsibilities as directors and that each such director is an independent director of the Company within the meaning of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2) and the related rules of the SEC. On November 8, 2022, the Company commenced its compensation to Fidelitas Development, of which Mr. Sickmeyer is the sole owner and Chief Executive Officer, for certain marketing consulting services that it provided to the Company. On February 22, 2023, Fidelitas Development received its final compensation for those services for an aggregate of approximately $22,000. While the services provided by Fidelitas Development did not impact Mr. Sickmeyers status as an independent director, the Board determined that Mr. Sickmeyer was not considered independent solely for purposes of his service on the Audit Committee during the approximate three and one-half-month compensation period. During that period, the Audit Committee took unanimous action and the Board believes that Mr. Sickmeyers service on the Audit Committee was in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders.\nThe Board of Directors held three meetings during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nBoard Committees\nAudit Committee\nThe purpose of our Audit Committee is to assist the Board in overseeing (i) the integrity of our Companys accounting and financial reporting processes, the audits of our financial statements, as well as our systems of internal controls regarding finance, accounting, and legal compliance; (ii) our Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; (iii) the qualifications, independence, and performance of our independent public accountants; and (iv) our Companys financial risk. In carrying out this purpose, the Audit Committee maintains and facilitates free and open communication between the Board, the independent public accountants, and our management. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Gao (Chair), Butler, and Sickmeyer served on our Audit Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the committee, except as described under \"Board Independence\", satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC and was determined by the Board to be financially literate with accounting or related financial management experience. The Board has also determined that Mr. Gao is an audit committee financial expert as defined under SEC rules and regulations and qualifies as a financially sophisticated audit committee member as required under Rule 5605(c)(2)(A) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. The Board has adopted a charter for the Audit Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Audit Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nCompensation Committee\nThe purpose of the Compensation Committee is to (i) discharge the Boards responsibilities relating to compensation of the Companys directors and executives; (ii) produce an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in the Companys proxy statement, if necessary; and (iii) oversee and advise the Board on the adoption of policies that govern the Companys compensation programs, including stock and benefit plans. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Butler (Chair) and Gao served on the Compensation Committee. Mr. Sickmeyer began serving on the Compensation Committee beginning in June 2023. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the\ncommittee satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC. In addition, each of the current members of the Compensation Committee is a non-employee director under Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) and an outside director for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). The Board has adopted a charter for the Compensation Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Compensation Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nGovernance and Nominating Committee\nThe purpose of the Governance and Nominating Committee is to (i) identify individuals who are qualified to become members of the Board, consistent with criteria approved by the Board, and to select, or to recommend that the Board select, the director nominees for the next annual meeting of stockholders or to fill vacancies on the Board; (ii) develop and recommend to the Board a set of corporate governance principles applicable to our Company; and (iii) oversee the evaluation of the Board and its committees. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, Messrs. Butler (Chair), Gao, and Sickmeyer served on the Governance and Nominating Committee. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, each member of the committee satisfied the independence standards specified in Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules and the related rules of the SEC. The Board has adopted a charter for the Governance and Nominating Committee, a copy of which is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. The Governance and Nominating Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee is charged with establishing and periodically reviewing the criteria and qualifications for Board membership and the selection of candidates to serve as directors of our Company. In determining whether to nominate a candidate for director, the Governance and Nominating Committee considers the following criteria, among others:\nthe candidates integrity and ethical character;\nthe candidates expertise, business and industry experience, judgement, diversity, age, and length of service;\nwhether the candidate is independent under applicable SEC and rules and regulations;\nwhether the candidate has any conflicts of interest that would materially impair his or her ability to exercise independent judgment as a member of the Board or otherwise discharge the fiduciary duties owed by a director to Live Ventures and our stockholders; and\nthe candidates ability to represent all of our stockholders without favoring any particular stockholder group or other constituency of Live Ventures.\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee has the authority to retain a search firm to identify director candidates and to approve any fees and retention terms of the search firms engagement, although it has not recently engaged such a firm.\nAlthough the Governance and Nominating committee has not specified any minimum criteria or qualifications that each director must meet, it conducts its nominating process in a manner designed to ensure that the Board continues to meet applicable requirements under SEC and Nasdaq rules (including, without limitation, as they relate to the composition of the Audit Committee).\nThe Governance and Nominating Committee will consider director candidates recommended by our stockholders under criteria similar to those used to evaluate candidates nominated by the committee (including those listed above). In considering the potential candidacy of persons recommended by stockholders, however, the committee may also consider the size, duration, and pecuniary interest of the recommending stockholder (or group of stockholders) in our common stock.\nThe Board believes that the continuing service of qualified incumbent directors promotes stability and continuity in the boardroom, giving our Company the benefit of the familiarity and insight into our Companys affairs that its directors have accumulated during their tenure, while contributing to the Boards ability to work as a collective body. Accordingly, the process of the Governance and Nominating Committee for identifying nominees reflects the practice of re-nominating incumbent directors who continue to satisfy the committees criteria for membership on the Board, who it believes will continue to make important contributions to the Board, and who consent to continue their service on the Board.\nStockholder Communication with the Board\nStockholders and others interested in communicating with the Board may do so by writing to Board of Directors, Live Ventures Incorporated, 325 E. Warm Springs Road, Suite 102, Las Vegas, Nevada 89119.\nChanges in Procedures for Director Nominations by Stockholders\nThere have been no changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to the Board of Directors.\nCode of Ethics\nLive Ventures has adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all directors, officers and employees of our Live Ventures, including its Chief Executive Officer and other principal financial and operating officers. The Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is posted on our website at ir.liveventures.com/governance-docs. If we make any amendment to, or grant any waivers of, a provision of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller where such amendment or waiver is required to be disclosed under applicable SEC rules, we intend to disclose such amendment or waiver and the reasons therefore on Form 8-K or on our website. ITEM 11. Executive Compensation\nCOMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\nOverview\nThe purpose of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) is to provide material information about the Companys compensation philosophy, objectives, and other relevant policies and to explain and put into context the material elements of compensation of our named executive officers (in this CD&A, referred to as the NEOs). For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, our NEOs were:\nJon Isaac, President and Chief Executive Officer\nThomas Sedlak, Chief Executive Officer of Precision Industries, Inc.\nEric Althofer, Chief Operating Officer\nBiographical information regarding our NEOs is presented in Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nThe Compensation Committee\nThe Compensation Committee reviews the performance and compensation of our President and Chief Executive Officer and the Companys other executive officers. Additionally, the Compensation Committee reviews compensation of outside directors for service on the Board and for service on committees of the Board and administers the Companys stock plans.\nRole of Executives in Determining Executive Compensation\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer provides input to the Compensation Committee regarding the performance of the other NEOs and offers recommendations regarding their compensation packages in light of such performance, however the Compensation Committee is ultimately responsible for determining their compensation.\nCompensation Philosophy and Objectives\nThe Compensation Committee and the Board believe that the Companys compensation programs for its executive officers should reflect the Companys performance and the value created for its stockholders. In addition, we believe the compensation programs should support the goals and values of the Company and should reward individual contributions to the Companys success. Specifically, the Companys executive compensation program is intended to:\nattract and retain the highest caliber executive officers;\ndrive achievement of business strategies and goals;\nmotivate performance in an entrepreneurial, incentive-driven culture;\nclosely align the interests of executive officers with the interests of the Companys stockholders;\npromote and maintain high ethical standards and business practices; and\nreward results and the creation of stockholder value.\nFactors Considered in Determining Compensation; Components of Compensation\nThe Compensation Committee makes executive compensation decisions on the basis of total compensation, rather than on individual components of compensation. The Compensation Committee attempts to create an integrated total compensation program structured to balance both short and long-term financial and strategic goals. Our compensation should be competitive enough to attract and retain highly skilled individuals. In this regard, we utilize a combination of two to four of the following types of compensation to compensate our executive officers:\nbase salary;\nperformance bonuses, which may be earned annually depending on the Companys achievement of pre-established goals;\ncash bonuses given at the discretion of the Board of Directors; and\nequity compensation, consisting of restricted stock and/or stock options.\nThe Compensation Committee periodically reviews each executive officers base salary and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board of Directors. Salaries are based on the following factors:\nthe Companys performance for the prior fiscal years and subjective evaluation of each executives contribution to that performance;\nthe performance of the particular executive in relation to established goals or strategic plans; and\ncompetitive levels of compensation for executive positions based on information drawn from compensation surveys and other relevant information.\nPerformance bonuses and equity compensation are awarded based upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee. Restricted stock is granted under the Companys stockholder-approved equity incentive plan and is priced at 100% of the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. Incentive and/or non-qualified stock options are generally granted under the Companys stockholder-approved equity incentive plan, as well, with the exercise price of such options set forth in the award agreement for such options. These grants are made with a view to linking executives compensation to the long-term financial success of the Company.\nUse of Benchmarking and Compensation Peer Groups\nThe Compensation Committee did not utilize any benchmarking measure in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and traditionally has not tied compensation directly to a specific profitability measurement, market value of the Companys common stock, or benchmark related to any established peer or industry group. Salary increases are based on the terms of each NEOs employment agreement, if applicable, and correlated with the Board of Directors and the Compensation Committees assessment of each NEOs performance. The Company also generally seeks to increase or decrease compensation, as appropriate, based upon changes in an executive officers functional responsibilities within the Company. Historically, the Compensation Committee has not used outside consultants in determining the compensation of the NEOs, and no such consultants were engaged during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.\nOther Compensation Considerations and Risk Management\nThe Compensation Committee has reviewed the Companys compensation policies and practices and has determined that, such policies and practices do not create risks that are likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nSUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nName and Principal Position Year Salary Bonus Stock Awards Option Awards (1)\nAll Other Compensation (2)\nTotal\nJon Isaac (3)\n2023 $ 350,000 $ - $ - $ 69,177 $ 10,226 $ 429,403\nPresident and Chief\nExecutive Officer 2022 $ 363,462 $ - $ - $ - $ 10,226 $ 373,688\nThomas Sedlak 2023 $ 446,749 $ 681,832 $ - $ - $ 90,044 $ 1,218,625\nChief Executive Officer of\nPrecision Industries, Inc. 2022 $ 319,707 $ 737,934 $ - $ - $ 64,221 $ 1,121,862\nEric Althofer 2023 $ 330,000 $ 330,000 $ - $ 237,206 $ - $ 897,206\nChief Operating Officer 2022 $ 326,077 $ 75,000 $ - $ 37,619 $ - $ 438,696\n_________________________\n(1)The amounts reflect the dollar amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes in accordance with ASC 718.
