All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Form 10-K, including statements regarding the Companys future financial condition, results of operations, plans, objectives, expectations, future performance, business operations and business prospects, are forward-looking statements. Words such as expects, anticipates, estimates, goals, projects, intends, plans, believes, predicts, should, seeks, will, could, would, may, forecast, and similar expressions and variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements and are included, along with this statement, for purposes of complying with the safe harbor provisions of the PSLRA. Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts, nor assurances of future performance. Instead, such statements are based only on our beliefs, expectations, and assumptions regarding the future. As such, the realization of matters expressed in forward-looking statements involves inherent risks and uncertainties. Such statements relate to, among other things, the following:\n\u25cf the development and commercialization by FuelCell Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (FuelCell Energy, Company, we, us and our) of fuel cell technology and products and the market for such products,\n\u25cf the expected timing of completion of our ongoing projects,\n\u25cf our business plans and strategies,\n\u25cf the markets in which we expect to operate,\n\u25cf the size and scope of our total addressable market opportunity,\n\u25cf expected operating results such as revenue growth and earnings,\n\u25cf our belief that we have sufficient liquidity to fund our business operations for the next 12 months,\n\u25cf future funding under Advanced Technologies contracts,\n\u25cf future financing for projects, including equity and debt investments by investors and commercial bank financing, as well as overall financial market conditions,\n\u25cf the expected cost competitiveness of our technology, and\n\u25cf our ability to achieve our sales plans, market access and market expansion goals, and cost reduction targets.\nThe forward-looking statements contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, that could cause actual results and future events to differ materially from those set forth in or contemplated by the forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, the risks described under ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Prior to making a decision about investing in our securities, you should carefully consider the specific risk factors discussed below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks and uncertainties we have described are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our operations. If any such risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In such cases, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Supply Chain\nWe have incurred losses and anticipate continued losses and negative cash flows.\nWe have transitioned from a research and development company to a commercial products manufacturer, services provider and developer. We have not been profitable since our year ended October 31, 1997. We expect to continue to incur net losses and generate negative cash flows until we can produce sufficient revenues and gross profit to cover our costs. We\nmay never become profitable. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future. For the reasons discussed in more detail below, there are uncertainties associated with our achieving and sustaining profitability. We have, from time to time, sought financing in the public markets in order to fund operations and will continue to do so. Our future ability to obtain such financing could be impaired by a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the price of our common stock, our lack of available shares and general market conditions.\nOur cost reduction strategy for manufacturing may not succeed or may be significantly delayed, which may result in our inability to deliver improved margins.\nOur cost reduction strategy for manufacturing is based on the assumption that increases in production will result in economies of scale. In addition, our cost reduction strategy relies on advancements in our manufacturing process, global competitive sourcing, engineering design, reducing the cost of capital and technology improvements (including stack life and projected power output). Failure to achieve our cost reduction targets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have debt and finance obligations outstanding and may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our financial condition and future financial results.\nAs of October 31, 2022, our total consolidated debt and finance obligations outstanding (indebtedness) was $83.5 million ($82.4 million, net of deferred finance costs).\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest and other required repayments depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flows from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flows, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring operations, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or dilutive.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business, which could include onerous restrictions on us. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify. Our debt agreements contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that entitle the lenders to cause our indebtedness under such debt agreements to become immediately due and payable.\nWe rely on project financing for our generation operating portfolio, which includes debt and tax equity financing arrangements, to realize the benefits provided by investment tax credits and accelerated tax depreciation. In the event that interest rates continue to rise or there are changes in tax policy, our financial results could be harmed.\nRising interest rates may increase our cost of capital. Part of our business strategy is to generate positive cash flows after debt service from our generation operating portfolio. Rising interest rates may have an adverse impact on the cost of debt and thus result in lower cash flows after debt service than we realize today. We also expect that projects we retain in our generation operating portfolio will receive capital from tax equity investors who derive a significant portion of their economic returns through tax benefits. Tax equity investors are generally entitled to substantially all of the projects tax benefits, such as those provided by the U.S. investment tax credit (ITC) and Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System or bonus depreciation. Our ability to obtain additional financing in the future depends on the continued confidence of financing sources in our business model and the continued availability of tax benefits applicable to our products. If we are unable to enter into tax equity financing agreements with attractive pricing terms, or at all, we may not be able to obtain the capital needed to finance the build out of our generation assets which would impact our overall liquidity and our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnanticipated increases or decreases in business growth may result in adverse financial consequences for us.\nWe operate a 167,000 square-foot manufacturing facility in Torrington, Connecticut where we produce the individual cell packages and assemble the fuel cell modules for our carbonate fuel cell products. The maximum annualized capacity (module manufacturing, final assembly, testing and conditioning) is 100 MW per year under the Torrington facilitys current configuration when being fully utilized. The Torrington facility is sized to accommodate the eventual annualized production capacity of up to 200 MW per year with additional capital investment in machinery, equipment, tooling and inventory.\nWe have a manufacturing and service facility in Taufkirchen, Germany that has the capability to perform final module assembly for up to 20 MW per year of carbonate sub-megawatt fuel cell power platforms to service the European market. Our European service activities are also operated out of this location.\nOur manufacturing and research and development facility in Calgary, Alberta, Canada is focused on the engineering and development of the Companys solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and SOEC technologies. This facility also houses our SOFC and SOEC stack research and development effort and includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including advanced manufacturing capabilities. This facility includes equipment for the manufacturing of solid oxide cells and stacks, including an advanced automated stack manufacturing line which has been developed to ensure that the labor and overhead which are required to produce these technologies are optimized for efficiency and complement the low direct material cost of the stack. As of October 31, 2022, this facility is capable of producing 1 MW per year of SOFC or approximately 4 MW per year of SOEC. We are investing in expanding this facility with the goal of increasing its production capacity to 10 MW per year of SOFC or 40 MW per year of SOEC, and we expect this expansion to be complete by the middle of fiscal year 2024. If this expansion is delayed, our ability to timely fulfill future orders to meet anticipated demand and our future revenues and ability to achieve profitability will be negatively impacted.\nIf our business grows more quickly than we anticipate, our existing and planned manufacturing facilities may become inadequate and we may need to seek out new or additional space, or retrofit or further equip our existing facilities, at considerable cost to us. If our business does not grow as quickly as we expect, our existing and planned manufacturing facilities would, in part, represent excess capacity for which we may not recover the cost. In that circumstance, our revenues may be inadequate to support our committed costs and our planned growth, and our gross margins and business strategy would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to risks in international operations, including risks relating to our ongoing relationship with POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy) and Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (KFC).\nSince we market our products both inside and outside the U.S., our success depends in part on our ability to secure international customers and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements in target markets, as well as the ability to provide service to our international customers. With the settlement of our litigation with POSCO Energy and KFC, we expect to make significant product sales into South Korea and, with our renewed emphasis on marketing our products in European markets, we expect to make future product sales there as well. We have limited experience developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. In addition, we are subject to tariff regulations and requirements for export licenses, particularly with respect to the export of some of our technologies. We face numerous challenges in our international expansion, including the strain any future growth may place on management, service and operations teams and financial infrastructure. We will face risk from complex and changing regulatory requirements, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, accounts receivable requirements and collections, difficulties in managing international operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on repatriation of any earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. In addition, with respect to South Korea, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we may have to rely on POSCO Energy and KFC for some period to provide certain services, such as operations and maintenance services to any new customers, and we will need their cooperation to transition long term service agreements from their existing customers to us in the future. Given the historical relationship among the parties with respect to certain actions and inactions by POSCO Energy and KFC and the prolonged litigation among the parties, there can be no guarantee that the parties will be able to successfully work together. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets (including project assets) become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to operations.\nWe have recorded significant impairment charges, and may in the future be required to record significant impairment charges, to operations in our financial statements should we determine that our goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets (i.e., in process research and development (IPR&D)) and other long-lived assets (i.e., project assets, property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets) are impaired. Such charges might have a significant impact on our reported financial condition and results of operations. Project assets and property, plant and equipment impairment charges totaled approximately $1.8 million, $5.0 million and $2.4 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs required by accounting rules, we review our goodwill for impairment at least annually as of July 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill is less than its carrying value. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill might not be recoverable include a significant decline in projections of future cash flows and lower future growth rates in our industry. We review IPR&D for impairment on an annual basis as of July 31 or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the fair value is less than the carrying value. If the technology has been determined to be abandoned or not recoverable, we would be required to record a charge reflecting impairment of the asset. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider a project asset commercially viable and recoverable if such project asset is anticipated to be sellable for a profit, or generates positive cash flows, in excess of the cost of the project asset once it is either fully developed or fully constructed. If any of our project assets are not considered commercially viable or costs are not deemed to be recoverable, we would be required to record a charge reflecting the impairment of such project assets.\nOur Advanced Technologies contracts are subject to the risk of termination by the contracting party and we may not realize the full amounts allocated under some contracts due to the lack of Congressional appropriations or early termination.\nA portion of our revenues has been derived from long-term cooperative agreements and other contracts with the DOE and other U.S. government agencies. These agreements are important to the continued development of our technology and our products. We also contract with private sector companies under certain Advanced Technologies contracts to develop strategically important and complementary offerings.\nGenerally, our privately funded Advanced Technologies contracts, including our EMTEC Joint Development Agreement, and our government research and development contracts are subject to the risk of termination at the convenience of the contracting party and may contain certain milestones and deliverables which we may not be able to meet if actual results differ materially from our original estimates. Furthermore, with respect to government-funded contracts, irrespective of the amounts allocated by the contracting agency, such contracts are subject to annual Congressional appropriations and the results of government or agency sponsored reviews and audits of our cost reduction projections and efforts. We can only receive funds under government-funded contracts ultimately made available to us annually by Congress as a result of the appropriations process. Accordingly, we cannot be sure whether we will receive the full amounts awarded under our privately funded, government research and development or other contracts. Termination of the contracts or failure to receive the full amounts under any of our Advanced Technologies contracts could materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nUtility companies may resist the adoption of distributed generation and could impose customer fees or interconnection requirements on our customers that could make our products less desirable.\nInvestor-owned utilities may resist adoption of distributed generation fuel cell plants as such plants are disruptive to the utility business model that primarily utilizes large central generation power plants and associated transmission and distribution. On-site distributed generation that is on the customer-side of the electric meter competes with the utility. Distributed generation on the utility-side of the meter generally has power output that is significantly less than central generation power plants and may be perceived by the utility as too small to materially impact its business, limiting its interest. Additionally, perceived technology risk may limit utility interest in stationary fuel cell power plants.\nUtility companies commonly charge fees to larger, industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back up purposes. These fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our SureSource products and could make our products less desirable, thereby harming our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend on third party suppliers for the development and timely supply of key raw materials and components for our products.\nWe use various raw materials and components to construct a fuel cell module, including nickel and stainless steel that are critical to our manufacturing process. We also rely on third-party suppliers for the BOP components in our products. Suppliers must undergo a qualification process, which takes four to twelve months. We continually evaluate new suppliers, and we are currently qualifying several new suppliers. There are a limited number of suppliers for some of the key components of our products. In addition, to the extent the processes that our suppliers use to manufacture components are\nproprietary, we may be unable to obtain comparable components from alternative suppliers, all of which could harm our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. We do not know whether we will be able to maintain long-term supply relationships with our critical suppliers, or secure new long-term supply relationships on terms that will allow us to achieve our objectives, if at all. A suppliers failure to develop and supply components in a timely manner or to supply components that meet our quality, quantity or cost requirements or our technical specifications, or our inability to obtain alternative sources of these components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, could each harm our ability to manufacture our SureSource products. In addition, our supply chain has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has created global shipping and logistics challenges. These challenges include extended shipping lead times and pricing pressures on transportation and logistics that have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our production schedules and project deadlines, may result in additional and increased costs, or may otherwise adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we are unable to pass these costs on to our customers or timely complete projects, we may experience reduced revenue and other adverse impacts on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Given that our customers and suppliers are facing similar global supply chain challenges, we expect continued difficulty in forecasting demand and supply needs for the foreseeable future. While we have implemented several initiatives to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our business, results of operations and financial condition may still be adversely impacted.\nOur business and operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak or other similar outbreaks.\nAny outbreaks of contagious diseases, including COVID-19, and other adverse public health developments in countries where we and our suppliers operate, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These effects could include disruptions to or restrictions on our employees ability to travel, as well as temporary or prolonged closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in economic downturns that could affect demand for our products or our ability to obtain financing for our business or projects. COVID-19 may impact the health of our team members, directors or customers, reduce the availability of our workforce or those of companies with which we do business, or otherwise cause human impacts that may negatively impact our business. Any of these events, which may result in disruptions to our supply chain or customer demand, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial results. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. Such developments may include new mutations of the virus, the continued efficacy of vaccines and the actions that may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak, such as periodic quarantine or shelter-in-place orders and business closures imposed by various states within the United States, and the impact on the U.S. or global economy. For example, on March 18, 2020, in response to the escalating global COVID-19 outbreak, we temporarily suspended operations at our Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility, and also ordered those employees that could work from home to do so. We resumed operations in the manufacturing facility on June 22, 2020, and we established a phased-in return to work schedule commencing March 15, 2021 for those employees working from home that was completed April 19, 2021. However, we continue to evaluate our ability to operate in the event of resurgences of COVID-19 and the advisability of continuing operations, based on federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees, customers and stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any of our facilities will remain open (in full or in part) or that our other operations will continue at full or limited capacity. If we again have to shut down production either due to a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic or due to an outbreak in one of our facilities, our project schedules and associated financing could be adversely affected. Further, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increased costs and expenses, including as a result of (i) conducting daily fitness-for-duty assessments for employees, including symptom checks and providing personal protective equipment, (ii) the expansion of benefits to our employees, including the provision of additional time off for employees who have contracted COVID-19 or are required to be quarantined or who are unable to obtain childcare to return to work, and the reimbursement of expenses incurred while working from home, (iii) implementing increased health and safety protocols at all of our facilities, including increased cleaning/sanitization of workspaces, restricting visitor access, mandating social distancing guidelines and increasing the availability of sanitization products, and (iv) the increased cost of personal protective equipment. Although we believe the Company is currently considered an essential business in its operating markets, if any of the applicable exceptions or exemptions are curtailed or revoked in the future, or any of these exemptions or exceptions do not extend to any of our key suppliers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted. As a result, at this time, it is impossible to predict the future impact of COVID-19 on our business, liquidity, capital resources, supply chain and financial results or its effect on clean energy demand, capital budgets of our customers, or demand for our products. Additionally, while we have continued to prioritize the health and safety of our team members\nand customers as we continue to operate during the pandemic, we face an increased risk of litigation related to our operating environments. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of any economic recession that has occurred or may occur in the future because of the pandemic, or because the pandemic worsens again. Additional public health crises could also emerge in the future, including other pandemics or epidemics. Any such public health crisis could pose further risks to us and could also have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nAn increase in energy costs, including as a result of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be directly affected by volatility in the cost and availability of energy, which is subject to global supply and demand and other factors beyond our control. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has impacted global energy markets, particularly in Europe, leading to high volatility and increasing prices for crude oil, natural gas and other energy supplies. Higher energy costs result in increases in operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities, in the expense of shipping materials to our facilities, and in the expense of operating our projects for which we procure natural gas, all of which may in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFailure to meet Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) expectations or standards or to achieve our ESG goals could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nIn recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on ESG matters, including greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equality and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights, and social responsibility. Given our commitment to ESG, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments, and targets which we may refine or even expand further in the future. These goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them, and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nSuch risks and uncertainties include:\nreputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments, or other stakeholders;\nadverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;\nthe success of our collaborations with third parties;\nincreased risk of litigation, investigations, or regulatory enforcement action;\nunfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;\ndiversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess, and report on ESG metrics;\nour ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within the timeframes announced;\naccess to and increased cost of capital; and\nadverse impacts on our stock price.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price.\nRisks Related to Sales of our Products\nWe derive significant revenue from contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes involving substantial costs and risks. Our contracted projects may not convert to revenue, and our project awards and sales pipeline may not convert to contracts, which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and cash flows.\nWe expect a significant portion of the business that we will seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through competitive bidding against other fuel cell technologies and other forms of power generation. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including the significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us and our failure to accurately estimate the resources and costs\nthat will be required to fulfill any contract we win. In addition, following a contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay or contract modifications or award revocation as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding. Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment could adversely affect our revenue and/or profitability.\nSome of the project awards we receive and orders we accept from customers require certain conditions or contingencies (such as permitting, interconnection, financing or regulatory approval) to be satisfied, some of which are outside of our control. Certain awards are cancelable or revocable at any time prior to contract execution. The time periods from receipt of an award to execution of a contract, or receipt of a contract to installation may vary widely and are determined by a number of factors, including the terms of the award, governmental policies or regulations that go into effect after the award, the terms of the customer contract and the customers site requirements. These same or similar conditions and contingencies may be required by financiers in order to draw on financing to complete a project. If these conditions or contingencies are not satisfied, or changes in laws affecting project awards occur, or awards are revoked or cancelled, project awards may not convert to contracts, and installations may be delayed or canceled. This could have an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flow and our ability to complete construction of a project.\nWe have signed product sales contracts, EPCs, PPAs and long-term service agreements with customers subject to contractual, technology, operating, commodity (i.e. natural gas) and fuel pricing risks as well as market conditions that may affect our operating results.\nWe apply the transfer of control over time revenue recognition method under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers to certain service contracts which are subject to estimates. On a quarterly basis, we perform a review process to help ensure that total estimated contract costs include estimates of costs to complete that are based on the most recent available information. The amount of costs incurred on a cumulative to date basis as a function of estimated costs at completion is applied to contract consideration to determine the cumulative revenue that should be recognized to date.\nWe have contracted under long-term service agreements with certain customers to provide service on our products over terms up to 20 years. Under the provisions of these contracts, we provide services to maintain, monitor, and repair customer power plants to meet minimum operating levels. Pricing for service contracts is based upon estimates of future costs including future module exchanges. While we have conducted tests to determine the overall life of our products, we have not run certain of our products over their projected useful life or in all potential conditions prior to large scale commercialization. As a result, we cannot be sure that these products will last to their expected useful life or perform as anticipated in all conditions, which could result in warranty claims, performance penalties, maintenance and module replacement costs in excess of our estimates, losses on service contracts and/or a negative perception of our products. As a result of our products lack of maturity, we have incurred and may continue to incur charges for warranty claims, performance penalties, maintenance and module replacement costs in excess of our estimates and losses on service contracts. Each of these risks could be material under these contracts and, as a result, we may experience diminished returns or be required to write off all or a portion of our capitalized costs in these project assets.\nIn certain instances, we have executed PPAs with the utility, end-user of the power or site host of the fuel cell power plant. We may then sell the PPA and power plant to a project investor or retain the project and collect revenue from the sale of power over the term of the PPA, recognizing electricity revenue as power is generated and sold. Our growing portfolio of project assets used to generate and sell power under PPAs and utility tariff programs exposes us to operational risks and uncertainties, including, among other things, lost revenues due to prolonged outages, replacement equipment costs, risks associated with facility start-up operations, failures in the availability or acquisition of fuel (including natural gas and renewable natural gas), the impact of severe adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, risks of property damage or injury from energized equipment, availability of adequate water resources and ability to intake and discharge water, use of new or unproven technology, fuel commodity price risk and fluctuating market prices, and lack of alternative available fuel sources.\nOur ability to proceed with projects under development and complete construction of projects on schedule and within budget may be adversely affected by escalating costs for materials and fuel (including natural gas and renewable natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges, tariffs, labor and regulatory compliance, inability to obtain necessary permits, interconnections or other approvals on acceptable terms or on schedule and by other factors. If any development project or construction is not completed, is delayed or is subject to cost overruns, we could become obligated to make delay or termination payments or become obligated for other damages under contracts, experience diminished returns or be required\nto write off all or a portion of our capitalized costs in the project. Each of these events could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe extend product warranties for our products, which products are complex and could contain defects and may not operate at expected performance levels, which could impact sales and market adoption of our products, affect our operating results or result in claims against us.\nWe develop complex and evolving products and we continue to advance the capabilities of our fuel cell stacks. We now produce stacks in the United States with a net rated power output of 350 kilowatts when new and a 7-year cell design life. We provide for a warranty of our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. We accrue for warranty costs based on historical warranty claim experience; however, actual future warranty expenses may be greater than we have assumed in our estimates. We are still gaining field operating experience with respect to our products, and despite experience gained from our growing installed base and testing performed by us, our customers and our suppliers, issues have been and may continue to be found in existing or new products including, but not limited to, module decay rates which have exceeded and may continue to exceed design expectations. This has resulted and may continue to result in a delay in recognition or loss of revenues and may result in loss of market share or failure to achieve broad market acceptance. The occurrence of defects has also caused and may continue to cause us to incur significant warranty, support and repair costs in excess of our estimates, could divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts, and could harm our relationships with our customers. Although we seek to limit our liability, a product liability claim brought against us, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time consuming, could be costly to defend, and may hurt our reputation in the marketplace. Our customers could also seek and obtain damages from us for their losses.\nWe currently face and will continue to face significant competition, including from products using other energy sources that may be lower priced or have preferred environmental characteristics.\nWe compete on the basis of our products reliability, efficiency, environmental considerations and cost. Technological advances in alternative energy products, improvements in the electric grid or other sources of power generation that use lower priced fuel or no fuel, or other fuel cell technologies may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products less economically attractive, non-competitive or obsolete prior to or after commercialization. Significant decreases in the price of alternative technologies or grid delivered electricity, or significant increases in the price of our fuels could have a material adverse effect on our business because other generation sources could be more economically attractive to consumers than our products. Additionally, in certain markets, consumers and regulators have expressed a preference for zero-carbon generating resources over fueled resources, which could adversely affect sales of our products in such markets.\nOther companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than ours, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, our products and technologies. Several companies in the U.S. are engaged in fuel cell development, although we are the only domestic company engaged in manufacturing and deployment of stationary carbonate fuel cells. Other emerging fuel cell technologies include small or portable PEM fuel cells, stationary phosphoric acid fuel cells, stationary solid oxide fuel cells, and small residential solid oxide fuel cells. Any of these technologies and any of our competitors has the potential to capture market share in our target markets. There are also other potential fuel cell competitors internationally that could capture market share.\nOther than fuel cell developers, we must also compete with companies that manufacture combustion-based distributed power equipment, including various engines and turbines, and have well-established manufacturing, distribution, operating and cost features. Electrical efficiency of these products can be competitive with our SureSource power plants in certain applications. Significant competition may also come from gas turbine companies and large scale solar and wind technologies.\nOur plans are dependent on market acceptance of our products.\nOur plans are dependent upon market acceptance of, as well as enhancements to, our products. Fuel cell systems represent an emerging market, and we cannot be sure that potential customers will accept fuel cells as a replacement for traditional power sources or non-fuel based power sources, hydrogen generation sources or storage. As is typical in a rapidly evolving industry, demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of\nuncertainty and risk. Since the distributed generation, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage markets are still evolving, it is difficult to predict with certainty the size of these markets and their growth rates. The development of a market for our products may be affected by many factors that are out of our control, including:\n\u25cf the cost competitiveness of our fuel cell products including availability and output expectations and total cost of ownership;\n\u25cf the future costs of natural gas, renewable natural gas (biofuels), and other fuels used by our fuel cell products;\n\u25cf customer reluctance to try a new product;\n\u25cf the market for distributed generation, hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and government policies that affect those markets;\n\u25cf government incentives, mandates or other programs favoring zero carbon energy sources;\n\u25cf local permitting and environmental requirements;\n\u25cf customer preference for non-fuel based technologies; and\n\u25cf the emergence of newer, more competitive technologies and products.\nIf a sufficient market fails to develop or develops more slowly than we anticipate, we may be unable to recover the losses we will have incurred in the development of our products, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe must complete development of our new products and develop additional commercially viable products in order to achieve our long-term revenue targets.\nIn fiscal year 2022, we established new target revenues to be met by the end of fiscal year 2025 and the end of fiscal year 2030. In developing these revenue targets, we assumed the successful commercialization of our SOEC, SOFC and carbon capture products. If we experience delays in meeting our development goals for these products, these products exhibit technical defects, or we are unable to meet cost or performance goals with respect to these products, including goals for power output, hydrogen production, rates of carbon capture, useful life and reliability, then our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability from sales of these new products will be delayed or may not occur at all. In addition, if we are unable to develop additional commercially viable products in the future, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to become profitable. The profitable commercialization of our products depends on our ability to reduce the costs of our products, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to sufficiently reduce these costs to achieve profitability.\nOur products use inherently dangerous, flammable fuels, operate at high temperatures and use corrosive carbonate material, each of which could subject our business to product liability claims.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in products that use hydrogen. Our products utilize fuels such as natural gas and convert these fuels internally to hydrogen that is used by our products to generate electricity. Although our platforms do not combust fuels for the generation of electricity, the fuels we use are combustible and may be toxic. In addition, our SureSource products operate at high temperatures and use corrosive carbonate material, which could expose us to potential liability claims. Although we have incorporated a robust design and redundant safety features in our power plants, have established comprehensive safety, maintenance, and training programs, follow third-party certification protocols, codes and standards, and do not store natural gas or hydrogen at our power plants, we cannot guarantee that there will not be accidents. Any accidents involving our products or other hydrogen-using products could materially impede widespread market acceptance and demand for our products. In addition, we might be held responsible for damages beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. We also cannot predict whether we will be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage on acceptable terms.\nRisks Related to Privacy, Data Protection and Cybersecurity\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology, and disruptions, failures or security breaches of our information technology infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our power plant platforms. In addition, increased information technology security threats and more sophisticated computer crime pose a risk to our systems, networks, products and services.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic and financial information and to manage a variety of business processes and activities, including communication with power plants owned by us or our customers and production, manufacturing, financial, logistics, sales, marketing and administrative functions. Additionally, we collect and store data that is sensitive to us and to third parties. Operating these information technology networks and systems and processing and maintaining this data, in a secure manner, are critical to our business operations and strategy. We depend on our information technology infrastructure to communicate internally and externally with employees, customers, suppliers and others. We also use information technology networks and systems to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and to operate our fuel cell power plants. These information technology systems, many of which are managed by third parties or used in connection with shared service centers, may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components thereof, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers or other cybersecurity risks, telecommunication failures, user errors, natural disasters, terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown, and our disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, or our fuel cell power plant operations may be disrupted, exposing us to performance penalties under our contracts with customers.\nIn addition, information technology security threats - from user error to cybersecurity attacks designed to gain unauthorized access to our systems, networks and data - are increasing in frequency and sophistication. Cybersecurity attacks may range from random attempts to coordinated and targeted attacks, including sophisticated computer crime and advanced persistent threats. These threats pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data.\nCybersecurity attacks could also include attacks targeting customer data or the security, integrity and/or reliability of the hardware and software installed in our products. We have experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, cybersecurity attacks that have resulted in unauthorized parties gaining access to our information technology systems and networks and, in one instance, gaining control of the information technology system at one of our power plants. However, to date, no cybersecurity attack has resulted in any material loss of data, interrupted our day-to-day operations or had a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. While we actively manage information technology security risks within our control, there can be no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to mitigate all potential risks to our systems, networks and data. In addition to the direct potential financial risk as we continue to build, own and operate generation assets, other potential consequences of a material cybersecurity attack include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, disruption to systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information, corruption of data, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness, results of operations and financial condition. The amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover claims or liabilities relating to a cybersecurity attack.\nAdditionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy in the U.S. and international jurisdictions is constantly evolving. Violation or non-compliance with any of these laws or regulations, contractual requirements relating to data security and privacy, or our own privacy and security policies, either intentionally or unintentionally, or through the acts of intermediaries could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as subject us to significant fines, litigation losses, third-party damages and other liabilities.\nTax, Accounting, Compliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In a prior fiscal year, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If other control deficiencies are identified in the future, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our Company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Complying with Section 404 requires a rigorous compliance program as well as adequate time and resources. We may not be able to complete our internal control evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. Additionally, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to assert that our internal controls are effective. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nIn a prior fiscal year, our management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which has been remediated. We cannot be certain that other material weaknesses and control deficiencies will not occur in the future. If material weaknesses are identified in the future, or if we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, our reported financial results could be materially misstated and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources, and the value of our common stock could decline.\nTo the extent we identify future weaknesses or deficiencies, there could be material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations. As a result, our ability to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all could be materially and adversely affected which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, our financial condition and the value of our common stock. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in the future, investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports could be further eroded, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of changes to our accounting policies or the methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations. Such methods, estimates and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that could lead us to reevaluate our methods, estimates and judgments.\nIn future periods, management will continue to reevaluate its estimates for contract margins, service agreements, loss accruals, warranty, performance guarantees, liquidated damages, inventory valuation allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts. Changes in those estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. We will also adopt changes required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC.\nWe may be affected by environmental and other governmental regulation.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to, among other things, land use, safe working conditions, handling and disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous substances and emissions of carbon dioxide and pollutants into the atmosphere. Our business exposes us to the risk of harmful substances escaping into the environment, resulting in personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, and natural resource damage. Depending on the nature of the claim, our current insurance policies may not adequately reimburse us for costs incurred in settling environmental damage claims, and in some instances, we may not be reimbursed at all. In addition, it is possible that industry-specific laws and regulations will be adopted covering matters such as transmission scheduling, distribution, emissions, and the characteristics and quality of our products, including installation and servicing. These regulations could limit the growth in the use of carbonate fuel cell products, decrease the acceptance of fuel cells as a commercial product and increase our costs and, therefore, the price of our products. We believe that our businesses are operating in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental laws; however, these laws and regulations have changed frequently\nin the past and it is reasonable to expect additional and more stringent changes in the future. Accordingly, compliance with existing or future laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. If we fail to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations, governmental authorities may seek to impose fines and penalties on us or to revoke or deny the issuance or renewal of operating permits and private parties may seek damages from us. Under those circumstances, we might be required to curtail or cease operations, conduct site remediation or other corrective action, or pay substantial damage claims.\nGiven that some of our product configurations run on fossil fuels, we may be negatively impacted by CO2-related changes in applicable laws, regulations, ordinances, rules or the requirements of the incentive programs on which we and our customers currently rely. Changes in any of the laws, regulations, ordinances or rules that apply to our installations and new technology could make it illegal or more costly for us or our customers to install and operate our products at particular sites. Additionally, our customers and potential customers energy procurement policies may prohibit or limit their willingness to procure our products. Our business prospects may be negatively impacted if we are prevented from completing new installations or our installations become more costly as a result of laws, regulations, ordinances, or rules applicable to our products, or by our customers and potential customers energy procurement policies.\nIn addition, certain of our products benefit from federal, state and local governmental incentives, mandates or other programs promoting clean energy generation. Any changes to or termination of these programs could reduce demand for our products, impair sales financing, and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA negative government audit could result in an adverse adjustment of our revenue and costs and could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nGovernment agencies, such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. If the agencies determine through these audits or reviews that we improperly allocated costs to specific contracts, they will not reimburse us for these costs. Therefore, an audit could result in adjustments to our revenue and costs.\nFurther, although we have internal controls in place to oversee our government contracts, no assurance can be given that these controls are sufficient to prevent isolated violations of applicable laws, regulations and standards. If the agencies determine that we or one of our subcontractors engaged in improper conduct, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, payments, fines, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the government, any of which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nExports of certain of our products are subject to various export control regulations and may require a license or permission from the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Energy or other agencies.\nAs an exporter, we must comply with various laws and regulations relating to the export of products, services and technology from the U.S. and other countries having jurisdiction over our operations. We are subject to export control laws and regulations, including the International Traffic in Arms Regulation, the Export Administration Regulation, and the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List, which generally prohibit U.S. companies and their intermediaries from exporting certain products, importing materials or supplies, or otherwise doing business with restricted countries, businesses or individuals, and require companies to maintain certain policies and procedures to ensure compliance. We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits improper payments to foreign governments and their officials by U.S. and other business entities. Under these laws and regulations, U.S. companies may be held liable for their actions and actions taken by their strategic or local partners or representatives. If we, or our intermediaries, fail to comply with the requirements of these laws and regulations, or similar laws of other countries, governmental authorities in the United States or elsewhere, as applicable, could seek to impose civil and/or criminal penalties, which could damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program loan received by us in 2020 and subsequently repaid by us in 2021 has resulted in an informal SEC inquiry into our financial disclosures and may subject us to challenges regarding qualification for the loan, enforcement actions, fines and penalties.\nOn April 20, 2020, we entered into a Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note, dated April 16, 2020 (the PPP Note), evidencing a loan to the Company from Liberty Bank under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act). Pursuant to the PPP Note, we received total proceeds of approximately $6.5 million on April 24, 2020 (the PPP Loan). In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, as amended by the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 (the PPP Flexibility Act), the PPP Loan may have been fully forgiven if (i) proceeds were used to pay eligible payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest and utilities and (ii) full-time employee headcount and salaries were either maintained during the 24-week period following disbursement of the PPP Loan or restored by December 31, 2020. If not so maintained or restored, forgiveness of the PPP Loan would have been reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the U.S. Small Business Administration. On October 29, 2020, we applied for forgiveness of the PPP Loan. While we believe we met all of the requirements of the CARES Act, as amended by the PPP Flexibility Act, for forgiveness, on February 11, 2021, we withdrew our application for forgiveness and repaid all amounts outstanding under the PPP Note, together with all accrued interest, in part because our financial circumstances had changed substantially since the time of the application for forgiveness, such that we were no longer in need of forgiveness of the PPP Loan. As a result of this repayment, the PPP Loan is not reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021.\nOur receipt of the PPP Loan, our submission of a forgiveness application, and our withdrawal of our forgiveness application may result in adverse publicity and damage to our reputation, governmental investigations, inquiries, reviews and audits, such as the SEC inquiry described below, which could consume significant financial and management resources. Any of these events could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOn or about May 11, 2020, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC sent us an inquiry requesting that we voluntarily provide information to the SEC pertaining to our application and resulting PPP Loan and how the need for the PPP Loan compares with our filings, disclosures and financial condition. While this request for information was voluntary and we were not obligated to respond, we cooperated with the request for information and voluntarily provided information to the SEC. The SEC did not communicate with us in fiscal year 2021 or fiscal year 2022 about its inquiry.\nRisks Related to Our Need for Additional Capital\nWe will need to raise additional capital, and such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If we do raise additional capital utilizing equity, existing stockholders will suffer dilution. If we do not raise additional capital, our business could fail or be materially and adversely affected.\nThe implementation of our business plan and strategy requires additional capital to fund operations as well as investment by us in project assets. If we are unable to raise additional capital in the amounts required, on terms acceptable to us, or at all, we will not be able to successfully implement our business plan and strategy. Our capital-intensive business model increases the risk that we will not be able to successfully implement our plans if we do not raise additional capital in the amounts required.\nIn addition, if we raise additional funds through further issuances of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, into the public market, including shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options or warrants, holders of our common stock could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of our then-existing capital stock. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our business and prospects could fail or be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if additional funds are not secured in the future, we will have to modify, reduce, defer or eliminate parts of our present and anticipated future projects, or sell some or all of our assets.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and Technology Licenses\nWe depend on our intellectual property, and our failure to protect that intellectual property could adversely affect our future growth and success.\nFailure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property.\nWe previously licensed certain of our carbonate fuel cell manufacturing intellectual property to POSCO Energy on an exclusive basis in the South Korean and broader Asian markets, and pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy, we have done so again, but this time on a limited, non-exclusive basis to enable module replacement to POSCO Energys existing LTSA customers only. (See the section above entitled Business - License Agreements-License Agreements and Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy for more information with respect to the limited license granted to POSCO Energy and KFC.) In addition, effective as of June 11, 2019, we entered into the EMTEC License Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms of the EMTEC License Agreement, to grant EMTEC and its affiliates a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid, perpetual, irrevocable, non-transferrable license and right to use our patents, data, know-how, improvements, equipment designs, methods, processes and the like to the extent it is useful to research, develop, and commercially exploit carbonate fuel cells in applications in which the fuel cells concentrate carbon dioxide from industrial and power sources and for any other purpose attendant thereto or associated therewith. Such right and license is sublicensable to third parties performing work for or with EMTEC or its affiliates, but shall not otherwise be sublicensable. Furthermore, on November 5, 2019, we entered into the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement, pursuant to which we agreed to grant EMTEC and its affiliates a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable, non-transferable (subject to certain exceptions) right and license to practice certain Company background intellectual property (to the extent not already licensed pursuant to the EMTEC License Agreement) for new carbonate fuel cell technology in carbon capture applications and hydrogen applications. We depend on POSCO Energy and EMTEC to also protect our intellectual property rights, but we cannot assure you that POSCO Energy or EMTEC will do so.\nAs of October 31, 2022, we (excluding our subsidiaries) had 129 U.S. patents and 251 patents in other jurisdictions covering our fuel cell technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions), with patents directed to various aspects of our SureSource technology, SOFC technology, PEM fuel cell technology and applications thereof. As of October 31, 2022, we also had 40 patent applications pending in the U.S. and 107 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. As of October 31, 2022, our subsidiary, Versa Power Systems, Ltd. (Versa), had 29 U.S. patents and 87 international patents covering SOFC technology (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions). As of October 31, 2022, Versa also had 7 pending U.S. patent applications and 21 patent applications pending in other jurisdictions. In addition, as of October 31, 2022, our subsidiary, FuelCell Energy Solutions, GmbH, had license rights to 2 U.S. patents and 7 patents outside the U.S. (in certain cases covering the same technology in multiple jurisdictions) for carbonate fuel cell technology licensed from Fraunhofer IKTS.\nSome of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent or patent application and includes trade secrets and other know-how that is not able to be patented, particularly as it relates to our manufacturing processes and engineering design. In addition, some of our intellectual property includes technologies and processes that may be similar to the patented technologies and processes of third parties. If we are found to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property, we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use such intellectual property on acceptable terms, if at all. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope, and enforceability of a particular patent.\nWe cannot assure you that any of the U.S. or international patents owned by us (including our subsidiaries) or other patents that third parties license to us will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others, or that any of our owned or licensed pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by us or our licensors, if issued at all. In addition, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or able to be patented, in part by confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, inventors rights agreements with our subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, consultants, strategic business associates and employees. We cannot assure you that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons or institutions will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships. Certain of our intellectual property has been licensed to us on a non-exclusive basis from third parties that may also license such intellectual property to others, including our competitors. If our licensors are found to be infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating third-party intellectual property, we do not know whether we will be able to obtain licenses to use the intellectual property licensed to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nIf necessary or desirable, we may seek extensions of existing licenses or further licenses under the patents or other intellectual property rights of others. However, we can give no assurances that we will obtain such extensions or further licenses or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us. The failure to obtain a license from a third party for intellectual property that we use at present could cause us to incur substantial liabilities, and to suspend the manufacture or shipment of products or our use of processes requiring the use of that intellectual property.\nWhile we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others or commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our rights or violating their agreements to protect our intellectual property. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense to us, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product or intellectual property and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not that litigation is resolved in our favor.\nThe U.S. government has certain rights relating to our intellectual property, including the right to restrict or take title to certain patents.\nMultiple U.S. patents that we own have resulted from government-funded research and are subject to the risk of exercise of march-in rights by the government. March-in rights refer to the right of the U.S. government or a government agency to exercise its non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable worldwide license to any technology developed under contracts funded by the government if the contractor fails to continue to develop the technology. These march-in rights permit the U.S. government to take title to these patents and license the patented technology to third parties if the contractor fails to utilize the patents.\nRisks Related to Our Common and Preferred Stock\nOur stock price has been and could remain volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors, including the following, some of which are beyond our control:\n\u25cf failure to meet commercialization milestones;\n\u25cf failure to win contracts through competitive bidding processes, or the loss of project awards previously announced or anticipated prior to entering into definitive contracts;\n\u25cf the loss of a major customer or a contract;\n\u25cf variations in our quarterly operating results from the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n\u25cf downward revisions in securities analysts estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u25cf changes in the securities analysts that cover us or failure to regularly publish reports;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf investor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u25cf insider selling or buying;\n\u25cf demand for our common stock;\n\u25cf dilution from issuances of our common stock;\n\u25cf general market trends or preferences for non-fueled resources;\n\u25cf the COVID-19 pandemic, including any worsening of the pandemic;\n\u25cf general technological or economic trends; and\n\u25cf changes in United States or foreign political environment and the passage of laws, including, tax, environmental or other laws, affecting the product development business.\nThe closing price of our common stock on December 14, 2022 was $3.72. There can be no assurance that the current stock price will be maintained, and it is possible that our stock price could drop significantly. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of their stock, companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation. If we become involved in securities class action litigation in the future, it could result in substantial costs and diversion of managements attention and resources and could harm our stock price, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock could affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of our common stock, into the public market, including shares of our common stock issued upon exercise of options or warrants, or perceptions that those sales could occur, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital in the future.\nProvisions of Delaware and Connecticut law and of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make a takeover more difficult.\nProvisions in our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (Certificate of Incorporation), and Amended and Restated By-Laws (By-laws) and in Delaware and Connecticut corporate law may make it difficult and expensive for a third-party to pursue a tender offer, change in control or takeover attempt that is opposed by our management and board of directors. These anti-takeover provisions could substantially impede the ability of public stockholders to benefit from a change in control or change in our management and board of directors.\nOur By-laws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a judicial forum deemed favorable by the stockholder for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur By-laws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty, any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our Certificate of Incorporation or our By-laws, any action to interpret, apply, enforce, or determine the validity of our Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws, or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholder finds favorable for disputes against us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other\nemployees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our By-laws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe rights of our Series B Preferred Stock could negatively impact our cash flows and dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders.\nThe terms of our Series B Preferred Stock also provide rights to their holders that could negatively impact us. Holders of the Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of $50 per share per year, payable either in cash or in shares of our common stock. To the extent the dividend is paid in shares of our common stock, additional issuances could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the sale of those shares could have a negative impact on the price of our common stock. A share of our Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 0.5910 shares of our common stock (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $1,692 per share), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Furthermore, the conversion rate applicable to the Series B Preferred Stock is subject to additional adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock with respect to payments upon liquidation, dividends, and distributions.\nThe rights of the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock rank senior to our obligations to our common stockholders. Upon our liquidation, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive $1,000.00 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends (the Liquidation Preference). Until the holders of Series B Preferred Stock receive the Liquidation Preference with respect to their shares of Series B Preferred Stock in full, no payment will be made on any junior shares, including shares of our common stock. The existence of senior securities such as the Series B Preferred Stock could have an adverse effect on the value of our common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nLitigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits, arbitrations, mediations, regulatory proceedings and claims, which may include lawsuits, arbitrations, mediations, regulatory proceedings or claims relating to commercial liability, product recalls, product liability, product claims, employment matters, environmental matters, breach of contract, intellectual property, indemnification, stockholder suits, derivative actions or other aspects of our business. Litigation (including the other types of proceedings identified above) is inherently unpredictable, and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business or our management, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nFinancial markets worldwide have experienced heightened volatility and instability which may have a material adverse impact on our Company, our customers and our suppliers.\nFinancial market volatility can affect the debt, equity and project finance markets. This may impact the amount of financing available to all companies, including companies with substantially greater resources, better credit ratings and more successful operating histories than ours. It is impossible to predict future financial market volatility and instability and the impact on our Company, and it may have a materially adverse effect on us for a number of reasons, such as:\n\u25cf The long-term nature of our sales cycle can require long lead times between application design, order booking and product fulfillment. For such sales, we often require substantial cash down payments in advance of delivery. For our generation business, we must invest substantial amounts in application design, manufacture, installation, commissioning and operation, which amounts are returned through energy sales over long periods of time. Our growth strategy assumes that financing will be available for us to finance working capital or for our customers to provide down payments and to pay for our products. Financial market issues may delay,\ncancel or restrict the construction budgets and funds available to us or our customers for the deployment of our products and services.\n\u25cf Projects using our products are, in part, financed by equity investors interested in tax benefits, as well as by the commercial and governmental debt markets. The significant volatility in the U.S. and international stock markets causes significant uncertainty and may result in an increase in the return required by investors in relation to the risk of such projects.\n\u25cf If we, our customers or our suppliers cannot obtain financing under favorable terms, our business may be negatively impacted.\nWeakness in the economy and other conditions affecting the financial stability of our customers could negatively impact future sales of our products and our results of operations.\nOur products require a long-term investment from our customers. Global inflationary pressures, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to levels not seen in recent years. Should our customers be impacted by these pressures, it could result in delays in purchasing decisions which could impact future sales of our products and our results of operations. In addition, downturns in the worldwide economy, due to inflation, geopolitics, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises, or other factors could also adversely affect our business.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions globally and the effects of these conditions on our customers businesses and levels of business activity.\nEconomic and political events in 2022 have altered the landscape in which we and other U.S. companies operate in a variety of ways. In response to inflationary pressures, the U.S. Federal Reserve has raised interest rates, resulting in an increase in the cost of borrowing for us, our customers, our suppliers, and other companies relying on debt financing. World events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions, have impacted the global economy, including by exacerbating inflationary and other pressures linked to COVID-related supply chain disruptions. Prolonged inflationary conditions, high and/or increased interest rates, and additional sanctions or retaliatory measures related to the Russia-Ukraine crisis, or other situations, could further negatively affect U.S. and international commerce and exacerbate or prolong the period of high energy prices and supply chain constraints. At this time, the extent and duration of these economic and political events and their effects on the economy and the Company are impossible to predict.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified management, technical, and other personnel.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the services and performance of our executive officers and other key management, engineering, scientific, manufacturing and operating personnel. The loss of the services of any such personnel could materially adversely affect our business. Our ability to achieve our commercialization plans and to increase production at our manufacturing facility in the future will also depend on our ability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. Recruiting personnel for the fuel cell industry is competitive. Our inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, or the departure of key employees, could materially and adversely affect our development, commercialization and manufacturing plans and, therefore, our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our inability to attract and retain sufficient personnel to quickly increase production at our manufacturing facility when and if needed to meet increased demand may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to any new product, growth or revenue opportunities. Our inability to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel to staff our government or third party funded research contracts may result in our inability to complete such contracts or terminations of such contracts, which may adversely impact financial conditions and results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in international operations.\nSince we market our products both inside and outside the U.S., our success depends in part on our ability to secure international customers and our ability to manufacture products that meet foreign regulatory and commercial requirements in target markets. We have limited experience developing and manufacturing our products to comply with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets. In addition, we are subject to tariff regulations and requirements for export\nlicenses, particularly with respect to the export of some of our technologies. We face numerous challenges in our international expansion, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and other geopolitical risks, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, longer accounts receivable requirements and collections, greater bonding and security requirements, difficulties in managing international operations, potentially adverse tax consequences, restrictions on repatriation of earnings and the burdens of complying with a wide variety of international laws. Any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe source raw materials and parts for our products on a global basis, which subjects us to a number of potential risks, including the impact of export duties and quotas, trade protection measures imposed by the U.S. and other countries including tariffs, potential for labor unrest, changing global and regional economic conditions and current and changing regulatory environments. Changes to these factors may have an adverse effect on our ability to source raw materials and parts in line with our current cost structure.\nAlthough our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar, we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. As a result, we are subject to currency translation and transaction risk. Changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could affect our net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange gains or losses. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations.\nWe could also expand our business into new and emerging markets, many of which have an uncertain regulatory environment relating to currency policy. Conducting business in such markets could cause our exposure to changes in exchange rates to increase, due to the relatively high volatility associated with emerging market currencies and potentially longer payment terms for our proceeds. Our ability to hedge foreign currency exposure is dependent on our credit profile with financial institutions that are willing and able to do business with us. Deterioration in our credit position or a significant tightening of the credit market conditions could limit our ability to hedge our foreign currency exposure and, therefore, result in exchange gains or losses.

Unless otherwise indicated, the terms Company, FuelCell Energy, we, us, and our refer to FuelCell Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries. All tabular dollar amounts are in thousands. In certain instances, the capitalized terms used in this section are defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Please see the section of this Annual Report entitled Forward-Looking Statement Disclaimer for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements, as well as the other risks set forth in our filings with the SEC including those set forth under the section entitled Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nHeadquartered in Danbury, Connecticut, FuelCell Energy has leveraged five decades of research and development to become a global leader in delivering environmentally responsible distributed baseload energy platform solutions through our proprietary fuel cell technology. Our current commercial technology produces electricity, heat, hydrogen, and water while separating carbon for utilization and/or sequestration. We continue to invest in developing and commercializing future technologies expected to add new capabilities to our platforms abilities to deliver hydrogen and long duration hydrogen-based energy storage through our solid oxide technologies, as well as further enhance our existing platforms carbon capture solutions.\nFuelCell Energy is a global leader in sustainable clean energy technologies that address some of the worlds most critical challenges around energy access, security, safety and environmental stewardship. As a leading global manufacturer of proprietary fuel cell technology platforms, FuelCell Energy is uniquely positioned to serve customers worldwide with sustainable products and solutions for industrial and commercial businesses, utilities, governments, and municipalities.\nFuelCell Energy, based in Connecticut, was founded in 1969 as a New York corporation to provide applied research and development services on a contract basis. We completed our initial public offering in 1992 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1999. We began selling stationary fuel cell power plants commercially in 2003.\nRecent Developments\nThe events described in this Recent Developments section relate, in part, to matters discussed in more detail below in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and/or in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain instances, the capitalized terms used in this Recent Developments section are defined elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGroton Project - Commercial Operations Achieved at 6 MW\nOn December 16, 2022, the Company declared and, per the terms of the Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement between the Company and Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative (CMEEC) entered into on that date (the Amended and Restated PPA), CMEEC agreed that the platform at the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT (the Groton Project) is commercially operational at 6 MW. As of December 16, 2022, the Groton Project will be reported as a part of the Companys operating generation portfolio. The Amended and Restated PPA allows the Company to operate the plant at a reduced output of approximately 6 MW while a Technical Improvement Plan (TIP) is implemented over the next year with the goal of bringing the platform to its rated capacity of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023. In conjunction with entering into the Amended and Restated PPA, the Navy also provided its authorization to proceed with commercial operations at 6 MW. The Company paid CMEEC an amendment fee of $1.225 million and will incur performance guarantee fees under the Amended and Restated PPA as a result of operating at an output below 7.4 MW during implementation of the TIP. Although the Company believes it will successfully implement the TIP within approximately one year and bring the plant up to its nominal output of 7.4 MW, no assurance can be provided that such work will be successful. In the event that the plant does not reach an output of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023, the\nAmended and Restated PPA will continue in effect, and the Company will be subject to ongoing performance guarantee fees as set forth in the Amended and Restated PPA.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, in August 2021, the Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction with East West Bancorp, Inc. (East West Bank) for the Groton Project. East West Banks tax equity commitment totals $15 million. In connection with the initial closing, the Company drew down $3.0 million. Under subsequent amendments, the terms of East West Banks remaining investment commitment of $12.0 million were modified such that East West Bank will contribute $4.0 million on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Groton Project achieving commercial operations, rather than contributing the full $12.0 million when the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. In conjunction with the amendments, the Company agreed to pay aggregate fees of $0.5 million, which were paid upon the Company declaring commencement of commercial operations of the plant on December 16, 2022.\nWith the declaration of commercial operations, East West Banks investment in the project has been reclassified as a non-redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 16, 2022.\nFor additional information regarding the Groton Project, see Liquidity and Capital Resources-Generation Operating Portfolio, Projects Assets and Backlog below.\nAmendment No. 3 to Joint Development Agreement with ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company and ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company (f/k/a ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company) (EMTEC) entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Joint Development Agreement between the Company and EMTEC, effective as of December 1, 2022 (such amendment, Amendment No. 3 and such agreement, as amended, the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement). In Amendment No. 3, the Company and EMTEC agreed to further extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement such that it will end on August 31, 2023 (unless terminated earlier) and to further increase the maximum amount of research costs to be reimbursed by EMTEC from $50.0 million to $60.0 million. Amendment No. 3 is intended to (i) allow for continuation of research that would enable the parties to finalize data collection in support of the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobils Rotterdam facility, (ii) allow for the continuation of the development, engineering and mechanical derisking of the Generation 2 Technology fuel cell module prototype, and (iii) allow for studying the manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction of a commercial Generation 2 Technology fuel cell carbon capture facility.\nResults of Operations\nManagement evaluates our results of operations and cash flows using a variety of key performance indicators, including revenues compared to prior periods and internal forecasts, costs of our products and results of our cost reduction initiatives, and operating cash use. These are discussed throughout the Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources sections. Results of Operations are presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our Results of Operations and Liquidity and Capital Resources includes a comparison of the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 (fiscal year 2022) to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 (fiscal year 2021). A similar discussion and analysis that compares fiscal year 2021 to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 (fiscal year 2020) may be found in Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nComparison of the Years Ended October 31, 2022 and 2021\nRevenues and Costs of revenues\nRevenues and costs of revenues for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n130,484\n$\n69,585\n$\n60,899\n88%\nTotal costs of revenues\n160,059\n85,224\n74,835\n88%\nGross loss\n$\n(29,575)\n$\n(15,639)\n$\n(13,936)\n89%\nGross margin\n(22.7)%\n(22.5)%\nTotal revenues for the year ended October 31, 2022 increased $60.9 million, or 88%, to $130.5 million from $69.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. Total costs of revenues for the year ended October 31, 2022 increased by $74.8 million, or 88%, to $160.1 million from $85.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The Companys gross margin was (22.7)% in fiscal year 2022, as compared to a gross margin of (22.5)% in fiscal year 2021. A discussion of the changes in product revenues, service agreements revenues, generation revenues and Advanced Technologies contract revenues follows.\nProduct revenues\nProduct revenues, cost of product revenues and gross loss from product revenues for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nProduct revenues\n$\n60,000\n$\n-\n$\n60,000\nN/A\nCost of product revenues\n64,495\n7,976\n56,519\n709%\nGross loss from product revenues\n$\n(4,495)\n$\n(7,976)\n$\n3,481\n(44)%\nProduct revenues gross loss\n(7.5)%\nN/A\nProduct revenues for the year ended October 31, 2022 were $60.0 million compared to $0 for the year ended October 31, 2021. The increase in product revenues is a result of module sales to Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (KFC) (a subsidiary of POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy)) for which the Company recognized $60.0 million on the Ex Works delivery of twenty modules from the Companys facility in Torrington, CT during the year ended October 31, 2022. Of these twenty modules, eight were delivered during the three months ended October 31, 2022.\nCost of product revenues increased $56.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 to $64.5 million, compared to $8.0 million in the year ended October 31, 2021. The increase is primarily due to the module sales to KFC. The increase also relates to a fixed asset impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million incurred during the year ended October 31, 2022 (related to the cessation of operations at a conditioning facility in Danbury, CT, which is being replaced by a new conditioning facility located at our Torrington, CT manufacturing facility as a part of our fiscal year 2022 and 2023 capital investments) and accrued warranty costs of approximately $0.5 million associated with the module sales to KFC discussed above. Manufacturing variances, primarily related to increased material, logistics, utilities and other overhead costs, totaled approximately $13.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to approximately $6.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2021.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, we operated at an annualized production rate of approximately 39.3 MW, which is an increase from the annualized production rate of 32.4 MW for the year ended October 31, 2021.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $9.1 million and $0, respectively, of product revenues backlog.\nService agreements revenues\nService agreements revenues and associated cost of revenues for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nService agreements revenues\n$\n12,786\n$\n19,791\n$\n(7,005)\n(35)%\nCost of service agreements revenues\n17,233\n24,735\n(7,502)\n(30)%\nGross profit (loss) from service agreements revenues\n$\n(4,447)\n$\n(4,944)\n$\n(10)%\nService agreements revenues gross margin\n(34.8)%\n(25.0)%\nRevenues for the year ended October 31, 2022 from service agreements decreased $7.0 million to $12.8 million from $19.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The decrease in service agreements revenues for the year ended October 31, 2022 is primarily due to fewer module exchanges during the year ended October 31, 2022 than during the year ended October 31, 2021. In addition, the decrease in service agreements revenues is also a result of the fact that we recorded a $3.8 million and a $1.0 million reduction in service revenues in the fourth fiscal quarters of 2022 and 2021, respectively, in each case as a result of higher future cost estimates related to future module exchanges compared to our prior estimates. Because we recognize revenue on service contracts over time using a cost input method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 (ASC 606), we evaluate the cost estimates associated with each service contract periodically and adjust revenue accordingly. In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, we reviewed our cost estimates relating to our service contracts and identified higher estimated costs than those that were previously identified. These higher estimated costs are due to our expectation that supply chain costs will remain high relative to prior years and that our production volumes will remain low, resulting in an increase in expected module costs. Because our estimated costs relating to the service contracts increased, we applied a reduction in revenue of $3.8 million and $1.0 million in the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, in accordance with ASC 606.\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, accrued performance penalties under our service agreements totaled approximately $0.7 million compared to approximately $1.6 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The decrease is the result of payments made to customers during fiscal year 2022. Accrued performance guarantees represent variable consideration for service contracts and accordingly are recorded as an offset to service agreements revenues.\nCost of service agreements revenues decreased $7.5 million to $17.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 from $24.7 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. Cost of service agreements revenues were lower for the year ended October 31, 2022 than for the year ended October 31, 2021 primarily due to the fact that there were fewer planned module exchanges in the service fleet that occurred during year ended October 31, 2022 than during the year ended October 31, 2021.\nWe record loss accruals for service agreements when the estimated cost of future module exchanges and maintenance and monitoring activities exceeds the remaining unrecognized consideration. Estimates for future costs on service agreements are determined by a number of factors including the estimated remaining life of the module(s), used replacement modules available, and future operating plans for the power platform. The net increase of approximately $0.8 million to the loss accrual in fiscal year 2022 was a result of adjustments to future cost estimates related to future module exchanges, as further described above.\nWe work to continuously improve and mature our products and implement lessons learned into our product designs and manufacturing process subsequent to introduction. In 2021, we examined data related to module field performance, identified improvement opportunities and invested in improvement initiatives with respect to our core molten carbonate technology. We continue to invest in such improvement initiatives. We have identified improvement opportunities ranging from improved thermal management by reducing internal temperature to improving the performance of our electrical balance of plant and implemented design changes to our commercial platforms which are expected to improve overall product performance. As it relates to our fuel cell modules, these improvements center around delivering more uniform temperature distribution within the stack modules with the intent of improving output over the life of the modules to achieve the products expected design life.\nCost of service agreements revenues for both years includes planned maintenance activities, module exchanges and continued investment in the service fleet in order to improve performance. Cost of service agreements includes maintenance and operating costs and module exchanges.\nOverall gross loss from service agreements revenues was $4.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2022, which represents a decrease of $0.5 million from a gross loss of $4.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The overall gross margin was (34.8%) for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to a gross margin of (25.0%) for the year ended October 31, 2021. Gross margin decreased during the year ended October 31, 2022 due to the fact that there were fewer module exchanges during the year ended October 31, 2022 and the module exchanges that were performed during the year ended October 31, 2022 were under service agreements with lower margins, compared to the year ended October 31, 2021.\nAs of October 31, 2022, service agreements backlog totaled $114.0 million compared to $125.9 million as of October 31, 2021. This backlog is for service agreements of up to 20 years at inception and is expected to generate positive margins and cash flows based on current estimates. Service agreements and license backlog as of October 31, 2021 also included $22.2 million of future license revenue which was reclassified to Product backlog as a result of the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC during the year ended October 31, 2022.\nGeneration revenues\nGeneration revenues and related costs for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nGeneration revenues\n$\n36,186\n$\n24,027\n$\n12,159\n51%\nCost of generation revenues\n63,147\n36,017\n27,130\n75%\nGross loss from generation revenues\n$\n(26,961)\n$\n(11,990)\n$\n(14,971)\n125%\nGeneration revenues gross margin\n(74.5)%\n(49.9)%\nRevenues from generation for the year ended October 31, 2022 totaled $36.2 million, which represents an increase of $12.2 million from revenue recognized of $24.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2021 due to a larger operating portfolio, improved operating output of the generation fleet and sales of renewable energy credits. Generation revenues for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 reflect revenue from electricity generated under our power purchase agreements (PPAs) and the sale of renewable energy credits.\nCost of generation revenues totaled $63.1 million in the year ended October 31, 2022, which represents an increase of $27.1 million from the year ended October 31, 2021. Cost of generation revenues included depreciation and amortization of approximately $15.5 million and $15.0 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase from the year ended October 31, 2021 was primarily due to expensed construction costs of approximately $22.1 million related to the Toyota project and costs of approximately $6.6 million related to the increased size of the installed fleet with the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) Yaphank project achieving commercial operation, offset by lower operating costs for existing plants due to efficiencies from plant maintenance activities and module exchanges.\nAs further background on the costs related to the Toyota project, it was determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that a potential source of RNG at favorable pricing was no longer sufficiently probable for the Toyota project resulting in impairment of the asset. Thus, as the Toyota project is being constructed, only amounts associated with inventory components that can be redeployed for alternative use are being capitalized. The balance of costs incurred (i.e., the approximately $22.1 million associated with the construction costs mentioned above) are being expensed as cost of generation revenues. The Company recorded a $2.8 million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, which represented the carrying value of the project asset less the carrying value of inventory components that could be redeployed for alternative use. The Company may continue to incur such charges in future periods.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company made the decision not to proceed with development of the 7.4 MW and 1.0 MW Hartford projects given the then current economic profile of these projects and as a result incurred an impairment charge of $0.8 million. The Company recorded an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 for the two LIPA project awards for which there were no executed PPAs (which are referred to as the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects), which totaled approximately $1.8 million, representing the full value of the project assets. The impairment charge for the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects was recorded because we made a decision to no\nlonger pursue development of the two projects. The Company also incurred an impairment charge of $0.4 million in fiscal year 2021 for the Triangle Street Project. In fiscal year 2022, we ceased using the Triangle Street Project as a development platform and returned the useable assets to inventory for future deployment as service replacements.\nRefer to Note 5. Project Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the impairment charges for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022.\nWe currently have three projects in development with fuel sourcing risk, which are the Toyota project, which requires procurement of RNG, and our Derby, CT 14.0 MW and 2.8 MW projects, which require natural gas. Fuel sourcing and risk mitigation strategies for all three projects are being assessed and will be implemented as project operational dates become firm. Such strategies may require cash collateral or reserves to secure fuel or related contracts for these three projects. If the Company is unable to secure fuel on favorable economic terms, it may result in impairment charges to the Derby project assets and further charges for the Toyota project asset.\nThe overall gross loss from generation revenues was $27.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2022, which represents an increase of $15.0 million from a gross loss of $12.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The increase in gross loss from generation revenues is primarily related to the $22.1 million of construction costs being expensed related to the Toyota project, partially offset by higher margins from the operating fleet (due in part to the higher operating output of the generation fleet portfolio) during the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to the year ended October 31, 2021.\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, generation backlog totaled $0.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\nAdvanced Technologies contracts\nAdvanced Technologies contract revenues and related costs for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended October 31,\nChange\n(dollars in thousands)\n$\n%\nAdvanced Technologies contract revenues\n$\n21,512\n$\n25,767\n$\n(4,255)\n(17)%\nCost of Advanced Technologies contract revenues\n15,184\n16,496\n(1,312)\n(8)%\nGross profit from Advanced Technologies contracts\n$\n6,328\n$\n9,271\n$\n(2,943)\n(32)%\nAdvanced Technologies contract gross margin\n29.4%\n36.0%\nAdvanced Technologies contract revenues decreased to $21.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. Compared to the year ended October 31, 2021, Advanced Technologies contract revenues recognized under the Joint Development Agreement between the Company and ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company, f/k/a ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company (EMTEC) (which was originally effective as of October 31, 2019) (as amended, the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement) were approximately $9.5 million lower during the year ended October 31, 2022 and Advanced Technologies contract revenues recognized under government contracts and other contracts were approximately $5.2 million higher for the year ended October 31, 2022.\nCost of Advanced Technologies contract revenues decreased $1.3 million to $15.2 million for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to $16.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. This decrease is a result of the level of activity and the scope of work performed under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement during the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to the year ended October 31, 2021.\nAs of October 31, 2022, Advanced Technologies contract backlog totaled $22.9 million compared to $40.8 million at October 31, 2021.\nAdministrative and selling expenses\nAdministrative and selling expenses were $79.6 million and $37.9 million for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The year ended October 31, 2022 included higher legal expenses associated with the settlement of the Companys disputes with POSCO Energy and KFC (as described in additional detail in Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The Company retained outside counsel on a contingency basis to pursue its claims against POSCO Energy and KFC, and outside counsel entered into an agreement with a litigation finance provider to fund the legal fees and expenses of the arbitration proceedings brought by the Company against POSCO Energy and KFC. In conjunction with the Settlement Agreement, dated December 20, 2021, among the Company, POSCO Energy and KFC (the Settlement Agreement), the Company was required to remit fees to its counsel, Wiley Rein, LLP (Wiley), subject to the terms of its engagement letter with Wiley. On December 23, 2021, the Company agreed that it would pay Wiley a total of $24.0 million to satisfy all obligations to Wiley under the Companys engagement letter, which was paid during the year ended October 31, 2022. The increase is also related to higher sales, marketing and consulting costs, as the Company is investing in rebranding and accelerating its sales and commercialization efforts, including increasing the size of its sales and marketing teams which resulted in an increase in compensation expense resulting from an increase in headcount.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses increased to $34.5 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to $11.3 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. The increase is due to an increase in spending on the Companys ongoing commercial development efforts related to our solid oxide platform and carbon capture solutions compared to the year ended October 31, 2021.\nLoss from operations\nLoss from operations for the year ended October 31, 2022 was $143.7 million compared to $64.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2021. This increase was primarily driven by a $64.9 million increase in operating expenses for the year\nended October 31, 2022 as a result of (a) higher administrative and selling expenses for the year ended October 31, 2022, which included higher legal expenses associated with the settlement of the Companys disputes with POSCO Energy and KFC as well as higher sales, marketing and consulting costs and an increase in compensation expense resulting from an increase in headcount and (b) higher research and development expenses, which were higher due to an increase in spending on the Companys ongoing commercial development efforts related to our solid oxide platform and carbon capture solutions compared to the year ended October 31, 2021. The increase was also due to higher gross loss of $13.9 million during the year ended October 31, 2022. Impacting gross loss for the year ended October 31, 2022 were higher manufacturing variances and non-capitalizable costs related to construction of the Toyota project which were partially offset by lower product gross loss primarily due to module sales to KFC.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $6.4 million and $7.4 million, respectively. Interest expense for both periods presented includes interest related to finance obligations for failed sale-leaseback transactions and interest on the outstanding loans associated with the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project.\nChange in fair value of common stock warrant liability\nThe $16.0 million expense for the year ended October 31, 2021 represents an adjustment to the estimated fair value of the then-outstanding unexercised warrants to purchase common stock held by the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement (as defined below), which were exercised, in full, during the year ended October 31, 2021. The expense was primarily a result of an increase in the price of the Companys common stock during the year ended October 31, 2021.\nLoss on extinguishment of Series 1 preferred share obligation\nA charge of $0.9 million was recorded in the year ended October 31, 2021 for the extinguishment of preferred stock obligation of subsidiary to recognize the difference between the amount of the payoff of the obligation under the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares (as defined elsewhere herein) issued by the Companys subsidiary, FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd., and the carrying amount of the Series 1 Preferred Share obligation.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt\nThe loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended October 31, 2021 represents costs associated with the repayment of the $80.0 million principal balance outstanding under the Credit Agreement among the Company, certain of its affiliates as guarantors, Orion Energy Partners Investment Agent, LLC, and certain lenders affiliated therewith (as amended, the Orion Credit Agreement). The amount includes an early prepayment penalty of $4.0 million and the write-off of debt discounts and deferred finance costs of $7.2 million.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net was $3.7 million and $(0.7) million for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Other income, net for the year ended October 31, 2022 primarily represents $3.5 million of interest earned on money market investments, a gain on derivative contract of $0.8 million, and $0.3 million of research and development tax credits, offset by foreign exchange losses of $0.9 million. Other expense, net for the year ended October 31, 2021 primarily relates to foreign exchange losses of $0.9 million related to the remeasurement of the Canadian Dollar denominated preferred stock obligation (the Series 1 Preferred Share obligation) of our U.S. Dollar functional currency Canadian subsidiary (FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd.) prior to the payoff of the preferred share obligation in December 2020.\nProvision for income taxes\nWe have not paid federal or state income taxes in several years due to our history of net operating losses, although we have paid foreign income and withholding taxes in Korea. Provision for income tax recorded for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.8 million and $2 thousand, respectively. The provision for income tax recorded for the year ended October 31, 2022 reflects the realization of withholding taxes on customer deposits which pertain to the sale of modules to KFC.\nNet loss attributable to noncontrolling interest\nFor the year ended October 31, 2022, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest totaled $4.5 million for the LIPA Yaphank tax equity financing transaction with Renewable Energy Investors, LLC (REI). There was no comparable net loss for the year ended October 31, 2021 as the LIPA Yaphank tax equity transaction closed and the LIPA Yaphank Project began operating in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The loss for the years ended October 31, 2022 is primarily driven by the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the 2021 tax year (which is consistent with the calendar year). The ITC reduces the noncontrolling interests hypothetical liquidation proceeds. This reduction in hypothetical liquidation proceeds drove the net loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest for the year ended October 31, 2022.\nSeries B preferred stock dividends\nDividends recorded on our 5% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) were $3.2 million for each of the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders and loss per common share\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders represents the net loss for the period less the preferred stock dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock. For the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, net loss attributable to common stockholders was $145.9 million and $104.3 million, respectively, and loss per common share was $0.38 and $0.31, respectively. The increase in the net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended October 31, 2022 is primarily due to higher gross loss and higher operating expenses for the year ended October 31, 2022 compared to the year ended October 31, 2021, partially offset by (i) lower interest expense during the year ended October 31, 2022, (ii) the fact that there was no loss on extinguishment of debt in the year ended October 31, 2022, no loss on extinguishment of preferred stock obligation during the year ended October 31, 2022, and no charge for the change in fair value of common stock warrant liability during the year ended October 31, 2022 and (iii) a net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest totaling $4.5 million (or approximately $0.01 per share) for the LIPA Yaphank tax equity financing transaction. The higher net loss per common share for the year ended October 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended October 31, 2021 is primarily due to the higher net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended October 31, 2022, partially offset by the higher number of weighted average shares outstanding as of October 31, 2022 due to share issuances since October 31, 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview, Cash Position, Sources and Uses\nOur principal sources of cash have been sales of our common stock through public equity offerings, proceeds from debt, project financing and tax monetization transactions, proceeds from the sale of our products and projects, as well as research and development and service agreements with third parties. We have utilized this cash to develop and construct project assets, invest in capital improvements and expansion of our operations, perform research and development on Advanced Technologies, pay down existing outstanding indebtedness, and meet our other cash and liquidity needs.\nAs of October 31, 2022, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $458.1 million compared to $432.2 million as of October 31, 2021.\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Canaccord Genuity LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Loop Capital Markets LLC (the Open Market Sale Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell up to 95.0 million shares of the Companys common stock. From the date of the Open Market Sale Agreement through October 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 18.5 million shares under the Open Market Sale Agreement at an average sale price of $3.63 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $67.2 million before deducting sales commissions and fees, and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $65.4 million after deducting commissions and fees totaling approximately $1.8 million. There were no sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, but there were sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 that settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 (as described in our Quarterly Report\non Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2022). As of October 31, 2022, approximately 76.5 million shares were available for issuance under the Open Market Sale Agreement. The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to accelerate the development and commercialization of its product platforms (including, but not limited to, its solid oxide and carbon capture platforms), for project development, market development, and internal research and development, to invest in capacity expansion for solid oxide and carbonate fuel cell manufacturing, and for project financing, working capital support, and general corporate purposes. The Company may also use the net proceeds from this offering to invest in joint ventures, acquisitions, and strategic growth investments and to acquire, license or invest in products, technologies or businesses that complement its business.\nOn June 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the 2021 Sales Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company could, from time to time, offer and sell shares of the Companys common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. From the date of the 2021 Sales Agreement through April 30, 2022, approximately 64.0 million shares of the Companys common stock were sold under the 2021 Sales Agreement, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $498.1 million before deducting sales commissions. Commissions of approximately $10.0 million in the aggregate were paid to Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. in connection with these sales, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $488.1 million. No sales of common stock were made under the 2021 Sales Agreement after April 30, 2022, and no additional sales of common stock can or will be made under the 2021 Sales Agreement, as the Company, Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. mutually agreed to terminate the 2021 Sales Agreement as of July 12, 2022.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, expected receipts from our contracted backlog, and release of short-term restricted cash less expected disbursements over the next twelve months will be sufficient to allow the Company to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo date, we have not achieved profitable operations or sustained positive cash flow from operations. The Companys future liquidity, for fiscal year 2023 and in the long-term, will depend on its ability to (i) timely complete current projects in process within budget, (ii) increase cash flows from its generation operating portfolio, including by meeting conditions required to timely commence operation of new projects, operating its generation operating portfolio in compliance with minimum performance guarantees and operating its generation operating portfolio in accordance with revenue expectations, (iii) obtain financing for project construction and manufacturing expansion, (iv) obtain permanent financing for its projects once constructed, (v) increase order and contract volumes, which would lead to additional product sales, service agreements and generation revenues, (vi) obtain funding for and receive payment for research and development under current and future Advanced Technologies contracts, (vii) successfully commercialize its Advanced Technologies platforms, including its solid oxide, hydrogen and carbon capture platforms, (viii) implement capacity expansion for solid oxide product manufacturing, (ix) implement the product cost reductions necessary to achieve profitable operations, (x) manage working capital and the Companys unrestricted cash balance and (xi) access the capital markets to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity securities, convertible notes, and other equity-linked instruments.\nWe are continually assessing different means by which to accelerate the Companys growth, enter new markets, commercialize new products, and enable capacity expansion. Therefore, from time to time, the Company may consider and enter into agreements for one or more of the following: negotiated financial transactions, minority investments, collaborative ventures, technology sharing, transfer or other technology license arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships, acquisitions or other business transactions for the purpose(s) of geographic or manufacturing expansion and/or new product or technology development and commercialization, including hydrogen production and storage and carbon capture, sequestration and utilization technologies.\nOur business model requires substantial outside financing arrangements and satisfaction of the conditions of such arrangements to construct and deploy our projects to facilitate the growth of our business. The Company has invested capital raised from sales of its common stock to build out its project portfolio. The Company has also utilized and expects to continue to utilize a combination of long-term debt and tax equity financing (e.g., sale-leaseback and partnership transactions) to finance its project asset portfolio as these projects commence commercial operations. The Company may also seek to undertake private placements of debt securities of a portfolio of assets to finance its project asset portfolio. The proceeds of any such financing, if obtained, may allow the Company to reinvest capital back into the business and to fund other projects. We may also seek to obtain additional financing in both the debt and equity markets in the future. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when needed, or on terms acceptable to us or our lenders, if we\ndo not satisfy the conditions of our financing arrangements, if we spend more than the financing approved for projects, if project costs exceed an amount that the Company can finance, or if we do not generate sufficient revenues or obtain capital sufficient for our corporate needs, we may be required to reduce or slow planned spending, reduce staffing, sell assets, seek alternative financing and take other measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nGeneration Operating Portfolio, Projects Assets and Backlog\nTo grow our generation operating portfolio, the Company will invest in developing and building turn-key fuel cell projects, which will be owned by the Company and classified as project assets on the balance sheet. This strategy requires liquidity and the Company expects to continue to have increasing liquidity requirements as project sizes increase and more projects are added to backlog. We may commence building project assets upon the award of a project or execution of a multi-year PPA with an end-user that has a strong credit profile. Project development and construction cycles, which span the time between securing a PPA and commercial operation of the platform, vary substantially and can take years. As a result of these project cycles and strategic decisions to finance the construction of certain projects, we may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the sale or long-term financing of such projects. To make these up-front investments, we may use our working capital, seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities, or seek other financing arrangements. Delays in construction progress and completing current projects in process within budget, or in completing financing or the sale of our projects may impact our liquidity in a material way.\nOur generation operating portfolio (36.3 MW as of October 31, 2022) contributes higher long-term cash flows to the Company than if these projects had been sold. We expect generation revenue to continue to grow as additional projects achieve commercial operation, but this revenue amount may also fluctuate from year to year depending on platform output, operational performance and management and site conditions. The Company plans to continue to grow this portfolio while also selling projects to investors. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had projects representing an additional 26.8 MW in various stages of development and construction, which projects are expected to generate operating cash flows in future periods, if completed. Retaining long-term cash flow positive projects, combined with our service fleet, is expected to result in reduced reliance on new project sales to achieve cash flow positive operations, however, operations and performance issues could impact results. We have worked with and are continuing to work with lenders and financial institutions to secure construction financing, long-term debt, tax equity and sale-leasebacks for our project asset portfolio, but there can be no assurance that such financing can be attained, or that, if attained, it will be retained and sufficient.\nAs of October 31, 2022, net debt outstanding related to project assets was $69.8 million. Future required principal payments totaled $32.3 million as of October 31, 2022. The outstanding finance obligations under our sale-leaseback transactions, which totaled $56.6 million as of October 31, 2022, include an embedded gain of $37.5 million representing the current carrying value of finance obligations less future required principal payments, which will be recognized at the end of the applicable lease terms.\nOur generation operating portfolio provides us with the full benefit of future cash flows, net of any debt service requirements.\nThe following table summarizes our generation operating portfolio as of October 31, 2022:\nProject Name\nLocation\nPower Off - Taker\nRated\nCapacity\n(MW) (1)\nActual\nCommercial\nOperation Date\n(FuelCell Energy\nFiscal Quarter)\nPPA Term\n(Years)\nCentral CT State University\n(CCSU)\nNew Britain, CT\nCCSU (CT University)\n1.4\nQ2 \u201812\nRiverside Regional Water\nQuality Control Plant\nRiverside, CA\nCity of Riverside (CA Municipality)\n1.4\nQ4 '16\nPfizer, Inc.\nGroton, CT\nPfizer, Inc.\n5.6\nQ4 '16\nSanta Rita Jail\nDublin, CA\nAlameda County, California\n1.4\nQ1 '17\nBridgeport Fuel Cell Project\nBridgeport, CT\nConnecticut Light and Power Company (CT Utility)\n14.9\nQ1 '13\nTulare BioMAT\nTulare, CA\nSouthern California Edison (CA Utility)\n2.8\nQ1 '20\nSan Bernardino\nSan Bernardino, CA\nCity of San Bernardino Municipal Water Department\n1.4\nQ3'21\nLIPA Yaphank Project\nLong Island, NY\nPSEG / LIPA, LI NY (Utility)\n7.4\nQ1'22\nTotal MW Operating:\n36.3\n(1) Rated capacity is the platforms design rated output as of the date of initiation of commercial operations.\nThe following table summarizes projects in process, all of which are in backlog, as of October 31, 2022:\nProject Name\nLocation\nPower Off-Taker\nRated\nCapacity\n(MW) (1)\nPPA\nTerm\n(Years)\nGroton Sub Base\nGroton, CT\nCMEEC (CT Electric Co-op)\n7.4\nToyota\nLos Angeles, CA\nSouthern California Edison; Toyota\n2.3\nCT RFP-2\nDerby, CT\nEversource/United Illuminating (CT Utilities)\n14.0\nSCEF - Derby\nDerby, CT\nEversource/United Illuminating (CT Utilities)\n2.8\nTrinity College\nHartford, CT\nTrinity College\n0.3\nTotal MW in Process:\n26.8\n(1) Rated capacity is the platforms design rated output as of the date of initiation of commercial operations, except with respect to the Groton Sub Base project. With respect to the Groton Sub Base project, the initial operating output is approximately 6.0 MW until the Technical Improvement Plan described below is fully implemented. Full implementation of the Technical Improvement Plan is expected to bring this platform to its design rated output of 7.4 MW. Accordingly, rated capacity with respect to the Groton Sub Base project is the platforms expected design rated output at the time of the full implementation of the Technical Improvement Plan.\nThe projects listed in the above table are in various stages of development or on-site construction and installation. Current project updates are as follows:\n\u25cf Groton Sub Base - The Groton Project. In July 2021, the Company achieved mechanical completion, executed the interconnect agreement, and commenced the process of commissioning the 7.4 MW platform at the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT (the Groton Project). On September 14, 2021, the Company disclosed that the process of commissioning the Groton Project was temporarily suspended due to a needed repair. Following the completion of that repair, the Company resumed commissioning of the Groton Project. During the resumed commissioning process, the Company observed operating parameter data from one of the\ntwo fuel cell platforms installed at the project site that indicated a mechanical component was not performing according to engineered specifications. The Company subsequently determined that component should be removed from the project site to facilitate the necessary repair and upgrade. On April 7, 2022, the Company announced that it had completed the necessary repairs and upgrades to the mechanical component, reinstalled the mechanical component at the project site, and restarted the process of commissioning. During the restarted commissioning process, the Company encountered performance anomalies primarily in the mixer eductor oxidizer (MEO), which is a sophisticated piece of equipment specific to the Groton Project designed to optimize fuel and air flows within the platform. In order to expedite the achievement of commercial operations of the Groton Project, the Company proposed operating the project at a reduced output of 3 MW per platform at the start of commercial operations in order to optimize performance of each of the two MEO units. Then, over a period of approximately one year, the Company would implement upgrades to each of the two MEO units in order to bring the platform to its rated capacity of 7.4 MW. On December 16, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated power purchase agreement (Amended and Restated PPA) which modified and replaced the existing power purchase agreement with Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative (CMEEC) to allow the plant to operate at a reduced output of approximately 6 MW while a Technical Improvement Plan (TIP) is implemented over the next year with the goal of bringing the platform to its rated capacity of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023. In conjunction with entering into the Amended and Restated PPA, on December 16, 2022, the Company and CMEEC declared that the plant is commercially operational at 6 MW and CMEEC and the Company agreed that, for all purposes, the commercial operations date has been achieved. The Navy also provided its authorization to proceed with commercial operations at 6 MW. The Company paid CMEEC an amendment fee of $1.225 million and will incur performance guarantee fees under the Amended and Restated PPA as a result of operating at an output below 7.4 MW during implementation of the TIP. Although the Company believes it will successfully implement the TIP within approximately one year and bring the plant up to its nominal output of 7.4 MW, no assurance can be provided that such work will be successful. In the event that the plant does not reach an output of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023, the Amended and Restated PPA will continue in effect, and the Company will be subject to ongoing performance guarantee fees as set forth in the Amended and Restated PPA.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, in August 2021, the Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction with East West Bancorp, Inc. (East West Bank) for the Groton Project. East West Banks tax equity commitment totals $15 million. In connection with the initial closing, the Company drew down $3.0 million. Under the original terms of the Companys agreement with East West Bank, the Company would have been eligible to draw the remaining amount of the commitment, approximately $12 million, once the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. In addition, under the original terms of the Companys agreement with East West Bank, the Groton Project had a required commercial operations deadline of October 18, 2021. The significance of the commercial operations deadline is that, if commercial operations were not achieved by such deadline, East West Bank would have the option to require an amount equal to 101% of its investment to be returned.\nEast West Bank granted several extensions of the commercial operations deadline, which collectively extended the deadline to May 15, 2022, in exchange for the Companys agreement to pay fees of $0.4 million in the aggregate.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Company and East West Bank amended their tax equity financing agreement and extended the commercial operations deadline to September 30, 2022. In addition, in the July 7, 2022 amendment to the tax equity financing agreement, the terms of East West Banks remaining investment commitment of $12.0 million were modified such that East West Bank will contribute $4.0 million on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Groton Project achieving commercial operations, rather than contributing the full $12.0 million when the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. Such contributions are subject to certain customer conditions precedent, including a third-party certification by an independent engineer that the plant is operating in conformance with the Amended and Restated PPA. In conjunction with this amendment, the Company agreed to pay aggregate fees of $0.5 million (which are inclusive of the fees from the previous extensions described above).\nOn October 4, 2022, the Company and East West Bank further amended their tax equity financing agreement to extend the deadline by which commercial operations were to be achieved at the Groton Project from September 30, 2022 to November 30, 2022. The Company and East West Bank further amended their tax\nequity financing agreement on November 30, 2022 to extend the deadline by which commercial operations were to be achieved at the Groton Project to December 31, 2022. In addition, modifications to the Groton Project documents between CMEEC and the Company as a result of the agreement between those parties to commence commercial operations at less than 7.4 MW were approved by East West Bank as part of East West Banks rights under the agreement between East West Bank and the Company.\nWith the achievement of commercial operations on December 16, 2022, the applicable commercial operations completion deadline in the agreement with East West Bank has been satisfied, East West Bank no longer has the right to require a return of its investment and East West Banks investment in the project has been reclassified as a non-redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 16, 2022. In addition, on December 16, 2022, the Company paid the aggregate fees of $0.5 million described above to East West Bank.\n\u25cf Toyota - Port of Long Beach, CA - The Toyota Project. This 2.3 MW Trigen platform will produce electricity, hydrogen and water. Fuel cell platform equipment has been built and delivered to the site, civil construction work has materially advanced, and significant portions of the platform have advanced to the commissioning phase of project deployment. We anticipate that the remaining construction and commissioning activity will be completed in the third fiscal quarter of 2023. Due to remaining construction and commissioning activity to be completed, commencement of commercial operations has been delayed beyond the initial contractual deadline for commencing commercial operations under the Companys Hydrogen Power Purchase Agreement with Toyota (as amended from time to time, the Toyota HPPA). The Company has previously entered into amendments to the Toyota HPPA to extend the commercial operations date and, effective as of December 16, 2022, the Company and Toyota entered into the Fourth Amendment of the Toyota HPPA. This amendment extends the required commercial operations date to July 8, 2023. In the event that we do not achieve commercial operations on or before the new deadline of July 8, 2023, Toyota will have the right to terminate the Toyota HPPA.\n\u25cf Derby, CT. On-site civil construction of this 14.0 MW project continues to advance, the Company has largely completed the foundational construction, and balance of plant components have been delivered and installed on site. This utility scale fuel cell platform will contain five SureSource 3000 fuel cell systems that will be installed on engineered platforms alongside the Housatonic River. To date, the Company has invested approximately $29.3 million into the project, with the majority of site work complete and the electrical and mechanical balance of plant installed. The Company continues to work with the utility customer, United Illuminating, on the interconnection process, the timing of which will drive the continued development of the site, including the delivery of the ten fuel cell modules required to complete the project. Our current expectation is that this project will commence commercial operations in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023.\nBacklog by revenue category is as follows:\n\u25cf Service agreements backlog totaled $114.0 million as of October 31, 2022, compared to $125.9 million as of October 31, 2021. Service agreements backlog includes future contracted revenue from maintenance and scheduled module exchanges for power plants under service agreements. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, approximately $22.2 million of backlog which was previously classified as Service and license backlog was reclassified to Product backlog as a result of the settlement agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC.\n\u25cf Generation backlog totaled $944.0 million and $1.1 billion as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. Generation backlog represents future contracted energy sales under contracted PPAs or approved utility tariffs. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company made the decision not to proceed with development of the 7.4 MW and 1.0 MW Hartford projects given the then-current economic profile of these projects. As a result, they have been removed from backlog. The Company intends to seek modifications to the PPAs relating to these projects, however, there can be no assurance that such modifications will be acceptable to the counterparties (Eversource and United Illuminating) or approved by Connecticut regulators.\n\u25cf Product sales backlog totaled $9.1 million as of October 31, 2022. There was no product sales backlog as of October 31, 2021.\n\u25cf Advanced Technologies contract backlog totaled $22.9 million as of October 31, 2022 compared to $40.8 million as of October 31, 2021. Advanced Technologies contract backlog represents remaining revenue expected to be recognized under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement and government projects.\nBacklog decreased by approximately 15.4% to $1.09 billion as of October 31, 2022, compared to $1.29 billion as of October 31, 2021, primarily as a result of a reduction in generation backlog due to the decision to not move forward with certain generation projects noted above, a reduction in service agreements backlog for fiscal year 2022 revenue recognition and Advanced Technologies contract backlog relating to fiscal year 2022 revenue recognition, offset by the addition of product sales backlog (specifically, the addition of product sales backlog from the module order received from KFC in January 2022).\nBacklog represents definitive agreements executed by the Company and our customers. Projects for which we have an executed PPA are included in generation backlog, which represents future revenue under long-term PPAs. Future revenue under PPAs is subject to the Company building out the projects contracted by the PPAs. Should the Company not complete a project covered by a PPA, it will forgo future revenues with respect to the project and may incur penalties and/or impairment charges related to the project. Projects sold to customers (and not retained by the Company) are included in product sales and service agreements backlog, and the related generation backlog is removed upon sale. Together, the service and generation portion of backlog had a weighted average term of approximately 17 years, with weighting based on the dollar amount of backlog and utility service contracts of up to 20 years in duration at inception.\nFactors that may impact our liquidity\nFactors that may impact our liquidity in fiscal year 2023 and beyond include:\n\u25cf The Companys cash on hand and access to additional liquidity. As of October 31, 2022, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $458.1 million.\n\u25cf We bid on large projects in diverse markets that can have long decision cycles and uncertain outcomes.\n\u25cf We manage production rate based on expected demand and project schedules. Changes to production rate take time to implement. During fiscal year 2021, we achieved an annualized production rate of 32.4 MW as of October 31, 2021. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we operated at an annualized production rate of approximately 41.5 MW, and for the full fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, we operated at an annualized production rate of 39.3 MW. For fiscal year 2023, we are planning to operate at a 45 MW annualized production rate in support of project backlog and service requirements.\n\u25cf As project sizes and the number of projects evolve, project cycle times may increase. We may need to make significant up-front investments of resources in advance of the receipt of any cash from the financing or sale of our projects. These amounts include development costs, interconnection costs, costs associated with posting of letters of credit, bonding or other forms of security, and engineering, permitting, legal, and other expenses.\n\u25cf The amount of accounts receivable and unbilled receivables as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $25.6 million ($9.7 million of which is classified as Other assets) and $35.2 million ($11.6 million of which is classified as Other assets), respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue that has been recognized in advance of billing the customer under the terms of the underlying contracts. Such costs have been funded with working capital and the unbilled amounts are expected to be billed and collected from customers once we meet the billing criteria under the contracts. Our accounts receivable balances may fluctuate as of any balance sheet date depending on the timing of individual contract milestones and progress on completion of our projects.\n\u25cf The amount of total inventory as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $98.5 million ($7.5 million is classified as long-term inventory) and $71.7 million ($4.6 million is classified as long-term inventory), respectively, which includes work in process inventory totaling $67.8 million and $45.7 million, respectively. Work in process inventory can generally be deployed rapidly while the balance of our inventory requires further manufacturing prior to deployment. To execute on our business plan, we must produce fuel cell modules and procure balance of plant (BOP) components in required volumes to support our planned construction\nschedules and potential customer contractual requirements. As a result, we may manufacture modules or acquire BOP components in advance of receiving payment for such activities. This may result in fluctuations in inventory and in use of cash as of any given balance sheet date.\n\u25cf The amount of total project assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $232.9 million and $223.3 million, respectively. Project assets consist of capitalized costs for fuel cell projects that are operating and producing revenue or are under construction. Project assets as of October 31, 2022 consisted of $125.2 million of completed, operating installations and $107.7 million of projects in development. As of October 31, 2022, we had 36.3 MW of operating project assets that generated $34.5 million of revenue in the year ended October 31, 2022.\n\u25cf As of October 31, 2022, the Company had 26.8 MW of projects under development and construction. To build out this portfolio, as of October 31, 2022, we estimate the remaining investment in project assets to be made during fiscal year 2023 to be in the range of approximately $45.0 million to $65.0 million. To fund such expenditures, the Company expects to use unrestricted cash on hand and to seek sources of construction financing. In addition, once the projects under development become operational, the Company will seek to obtain permanent financing (tax equity and debt) which would be expected to return cash to the business. For fiscal year 2022, capitalized project\u202fasset\u202fexpenditures were $25.6 million. In addition, the Company expensed costs related to the Toyota project which totaled $22.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2022.\n\u25cf Certain of our PPAs for project assets in our generation operating portfolio and project assets under construction expose us to fluctuating fuel price risks as well as the risk of being unable to procure the required amounts of fuel and the lack of alternative available fuel sources. We seek to mitigate our fuel risk using strategies including: (i) fuel cost reimbursement mechanisms in our PPAs to allow for pass through of fuel costs (full or partial) where possible, which we have done with our 14.9 MW operating project in Bridgeport, CT; (ii) procuring fuel under fixed price physical contracts with investment grade counterparties, which we have done for twenty years for our Tulare BioMAT project and the initial seven years of the eighteen year PPA for our LIPA Yaphank, NY project; and (iii) potentially entering into future financial hedges with investment grade counterparties to offset potential negative market fluctuations.\nWe currently have three projects in development with fuel sourcing risk, which are the Toyota project, which requires procurement of renewable natural gas (RNG), and our Derby, CT 14.0 MW and 2.8 MW projects, both of which require natural gas for which there is no pass through mechanism in the related PPAs. Fuel sourcing and risk mitigation strategies for all three projects are being assessed and will be implemented as project operational dates become firm. Such strategies may require cash collateral or reserves to secure fuel or related contracts for these three projects.\n\u25cf Capital expenditures are expected to range between $60.0 million to $90.0 million for fiscal year 2023, which includes expected investments in our manufacturing facilities for molten carbonate and solid oxide production capacity expansion, the addition of test facilities for new products and components, the expansion of our laboratories and upgrades to and expansion of our business systems. Included in projected expenditures associated with the capacity expansion for molten carbonate is equipment to launch the carbon capture platform manufacturing required for the assembly of the jointly developed technology with EMTEC. The solid oxide production capacity expansion is underway in our Calgary Canada facility and is expected to increase the capacity of the facility from 1 MW to 10 MW per year of SOFC production or from 4 MW to 40 MW per year of SOEC production by the middle of fiscal year 2024.\n\u25cf Company-funded research and development expenditures are expected to be in the range between $50.0 million and $70.0 million for fiscal year 2023. During fiscal year 2022, we incurred a total of $34.5 million of Company-funded research and development expenditures as we continued to accelerate commercialization of our Advanced Technologies solutions including distributed hydrogen, hydrogen based long duration energy storage and hydrogen power generation. The Company continues to advance its solid oxide platform research, including increasing production of solid oxide fuel cell modules and expanding manufacturing capacity. The Company continues to work with Idaho National Laboratories on a demonstration high-efficiency electrolysis platform. This project, done in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Energy, is intended to demonstrate that the Companys platform can operate at higher electrical efficiency than currently available electrolysis\ntechnologies through the inclusion of an external heat source. To further accelerate the commercialization activity for the solid oxide platform, the Company recently commenced the design and construction of two advanced prototypes targeted for fiscal year 2023 completion: (i) a 250 kW power generation platform, and (ii) a 1 MW high-efficiency electrolysis platform.\n\u25cf Under the terms of certain contracts, the Company will provide performance security for future contractual obligations. As of October 31, 2022, we had pledged approximately $23.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents as collateral for performance security and for letters of credit for certain banking requirements and contracts. This balance may increase with a growing backlog and installed fleet.\n\u25cf On August 16, 2022, the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA or the \"Act\") was signed into law. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, incentivize domestic clean energy investment, manufacturing and production. The IRA includes provisions that provide incentives for clean energy through enhancement of the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) program, Production Tax Credits for clean energy component sourcing and production in the United States, enhancements to Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code which provides credits for carbon oxide sequestration intended to incentivize investment in carbon capture and sequestration, and certain incentives for clean energy projects that use environmental brownfield sites and/or are located in economically challenged areas. In addition, the Act would provide a 10-year Production Tax Credit (PTC) for the production of clean hydrogen at a qualified facility that begins construction prior to January 1, 2033, with the option to elect the ITC in lieu of the PTC. The Company views the enactment of the IRA as favorable for the overall business climate for fuel cell manufacturers, however, the Company is continuing to evaluate the overall impact and applicability of the IRA to the Companys current and planned products and the markets in which the Company seeks to sell its products.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nAs the Company builds project assets and makes capital expenditures, depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to increase. For the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, depreciation and amortization totaled $21.3 million and $19.9 million, respectively (of these totals, approximately $15.5 million and $15.0 million for the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, relate to depreciation of project assets in our generation operating portfolio and amortization of a generation intangible asset).\nCash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $481.0 million as of October 31, 2022 compared to $460.2 million as of October 31, 2021. As of October 31, 2022, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was $458.1 million compared to $432.2 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2021. As of October 31, 2022, restricted cash and cash equivalents was $23.0 million, of which $4.4 million was classified as current and $18.6 million was classified as non-current, compared to $28.0 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2021, of which $11.3 million was classified as current and $16.7 million was classified as non-current.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows:\nYear Ended October 31,\n(dollars in thousands)\nConsolidated Cash Flow Data:\nNet cash used in operating activities\n$\n(112,167)\n$\n(70,438)\n$\n(36,781)\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(46,651)\n(73,230)\n(32,520)\nNet cash provided by financing activities\n180,583\n411,908\n221,667\nEffects on cash from changes in foreign currency rates\n(933)\n(80)\n(92)\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n20,832\n$\n268,160\n$\n152,274\nThe key components of our cash inflows and outflows were as follows:\nOperating Activities - Net cash used in operating activities was $112.2 million during fiscal year 2022 compared to net cash used in operating activities of $70.4 million in fiscal year 2021 and net cash used in operating activities of $36.8 million in fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily a result of the net loss of $147.2 million, increases in inventories of $28.1 million, other assets of $2.1 million and unbilled receivables of $0.2 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $11.3 million partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of $9.2 million, increases in accrued liabilities of $24.6 million and accounts payable of $6.3 million and non-cash adjustments of $35.0 million and cash adjustments of $1.6 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2021 was primarily the result of the net loss of $101.1 million, increases in accounts receivable of $5.2 million, unbilled receivables of $3.6 million and inventory of $18.8 million and decreases in deferred revenue of $5.2 million. These amounts were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of $2.0 million and accrued liabilities of $0.3 million and net non-cash adjustments of $59.8 million.\nNet cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2020 was primarily the result of the net loss of $89.1 million, increases in accounts receivable of $6.3 million, unbilled receivables of $5.6 million and inventory of $2.1 million and a decrease in accounts payable of $7.1 million. These amounts were partially offset by increases in accrued liabilities of $5.5 million and deferred revenue of $1.7 million and net non-cash adjustments of $68.5 million.\nInvesting Activities - Net cash used in investing activities was $46.7 million during fiscal year 2022 compared to $73.2 million in fiscal year 2021 and $32.5 million in fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2022 included $25.6 million of project asset expenditures and $21.1 million of capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2021 included $66.9 million of project asset expenditures and $6.4 million of capital expenditures.\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2020 included $31.5 million of project asset expenditures and a $0.6 million payment for a working capital adjustment for the May 2019 acquisition of the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project.\nFinancing Activities - Net cash provided by financing activities was $180.6 million during fiscal year 2022 compared to $411.9 million in fiscal year 2021 and $221.7 million in fiscal year 2020.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2022 resulted from $183.6 million of net proceeds from sales of common stock and $11.9 million of net contributions received from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in the LIPA Yaphank Project, partially offset by debt repayments of $9.5 million, payment for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards of $1.9 million, payment of $3.2 million of preferred dividends to the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock and distribution to noncontrolling interest of $0.3 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 resulted from $525.9 million of proceeds from common stock sales, net of fees and expenses, $10.2 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction with Crestmark Equipment Finance, $3.0 million contribution received from a noncontrolling interest, and $0.9 million of proceeds received from warrant exercises, offset by debt repayments of $98.6 million primarily relating to the payoff of amounts owed under the Orion Credit Agreement and the PPP Note, a prepayment penalty of $4.0 million for the early payoff of the debt outstanding under the Orion Credit Agreement, payment of preferred dividends of $3.2 million under the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, payment of $21.5 million to repay all remaining obligations under the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares and the payment of deferred financing costs of $0.4 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2020 resulted from the receipt of $63.9 million of debt proceeds under the Orion Facility, which was net of a loan discount of $1.6 million, $14.4 million of proceeds from the sale-leaseback transaction with Crestmark Equipment Finance, $6.5 million of debt proceeds from Liberty Bank under the PPP Note, $3.0 million of debt proceeds from Connecticut Green Bank, $98.3 million of net proceeds from an underwritten equity offering that closed in October 2020, $73.6 million of net proceeds from at-the-market sales of common stock (after deducting commissions), and $1.3 million of net proceeds from warrant conversions, offset by debt repayments of $30.1 million, the payment of preferred dividends and return of capital of $6.5 million, and the payment of deferred financing costs of $2.7 million.\nCommitments and Significant Contractual Obligations\nA summary of our significant future commitments and contractual obligations as of October 31, 2022 and the related payments by fiscal year is summarized as follows:\nPayments Due by Period\n(dollars in thousands)\nTotal\nLess than\n1 Year\n1 - 3\nYears\n3 - 5\nYears\nMore than\n5 Years\nPurchase commitments (1)\n$\n67,089\n$\n65,659\n$\n1,312\n$\n$\n-\nTerm loans (principal and interest)\n28,966\n7,930\n13,212\n4,446\n3,378\nCapital and operating lease commitments (2)\n17,871\n1,171\n1,677\n1,549\n13,474\nSale-leaseback finance obligations (3)\n18,047\n3,252\n6,517\n4,234\n4,044\nNatural gas supply contract (4)\n11,650\n1,969\n3,938\n3,938\n1,805\nSeries B Preferred dividends payable (5)\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nTotals\n$\n143,623\n$\n79,981\n$\n26,656\n$\n14,285\n$\n22,701\n(1) Purchase commitments with suppliers for materials, supplies and services incurred in the normal course of business.\n(2) Future minimum lease payments on finance and operating leases.\n(3) Represents payments due under sale-leaseback transactions and related financing agreements between certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and PNC Energy Capital, LLC (PNC) and/or Crestmark Equipment Finance (Crestmark) (as applicable). Lease payments for each lease under these financing agreements are generally payable in fixed quarterly installments over a 10-year period.\n(4) During fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into a 7-year natural gas contract with an estimated annual cost per year of $2.0 million which was set to begin on November 1, 2021. Actual service began under the contract on December 7, 2021 to coincide with our commissioning schedule. This gas contract is for the Companys Yaphank project and the costs are expected to be offset by generation revenues on the project.\n(5) We pay $3.2 million in annual dividends on our Series B Preferred Stock, if and when declared. The $3.2 million annual dividend payment, if dividends are declared, has not been included in this table as we cannot reasonably determine when or if we will be able to convert the Series B Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock. We may, at our option, convert these shares into the number of shares of our common stock that are issuable at the then prevailing conversion rate if the closing price of our common stock exceeds 150% of the then prevailing conversion price ($1,692 per share at October 31, 2022) for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period.\nTerm and Construction Loans\nA discussion of the key terms and conditions of the loans outstanding as of October 31, 2022 is included in Note 10. Debt to the consolidated financial statements and is incorporated by reference herein. The information included under the headings Connecticut Green Bank Loans, Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project Loans, State of Connecticut Loan, and Finance obligations for sale-leaseback agreements in Note 10. Debt to the consolidated financial statements is incorporated herein by reference.\nRestricted Cash\nWe have pledged approximately $23.0 million of our cash and cash equivalents as performance security and for letters of credit for certain banking requirements and contracts. As of October 31, 2022, outstanding letters of credit totaled $5.0 million. These expire on various dates through December 2028. Under the terms of certain contracts, we will provide performance security for future contractual obligations. The restricted cash balance as of October 31, 2022 also included $7.9 million primarily to support obligations under the power purchase and service agreements related to the PNC and Crestmark sale-leaseback transactions and $8.7 million relating to future obligations associated with the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project. Refer to Note 17. Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of the Companys restricted cash balance.\nPower purchase agreements\nUnder the terms of our PPAs, customers agree to purchase power from our fuel cell power plants at negotiated rates. Electricity rates are generally a function of the customers current and estimated future electricity pricing available from the grid. We are responsible for all operating costs necessary to maintain, monitor and repair our fuel cell power platforms.\nUnder certain agreements, we are also responsible for procuring fuel, generally natural gas or biogas, to run our fuel cell power platforms. In addition, under certain agreements, we are required to produce minimum amounts of power under our PPAs and we have the right to terminate PPAs by giving written notice to the customer, subject to certain exit costs. As of October 31, 2022, our generation operating portfolio was 36.3 MW.\nService and warranty agreements\nWe warranty our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. Our standard U.S. warranty period is generally 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of the product. In addition to the standard product warranty, we have contracted with certain customers to provide services to ensure the power plants meet minimum operating levels for terms of up to 20 years. Pricing for service contracts is based upon estimates of future costs, which could be materially different from actual expenses. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for additional details.\nAdvanced Technologies contracts\nWe have contracted with various government agencies and certain companies from private industry to conduct research and development as either a prime contractor or sub-contractor under multi-year, cost-reimbursement and/or cost-share type contracts or cooperative agreements. Cost-share terms require that participating contractors share the total cost of the project based on an agreed upon ratio. In many cases, we are reimbursed only a portion of the costs incurred or to be incurred on the contract. While government research and development contracts may extend for many years, funding is often provided incrementally on a year-by-year basis if contract terms are met and Congress authorizes the funds. As of October 31, 2022, Advanced Technologies contract backlog totaled $22.9 million, of which $8.1 million is non-U.S. Government-funded, $13.6 million is U.S. Government-funded and $1.2 million is U.S. Government-unfunded.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet debt or similar obligations which are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third-party debt. See Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2022 included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, revenue recognition, contract loss accruals, excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventories, product warranty accruals, loss accruals on service agreements, share-based compensation expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and in-process research and development intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets (including project assets), lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets, and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from those estimates.\nOur critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Our accounting policies are set forth below.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. The intangible asset represents indefinite-lived in-process research and development for cumulative research and development efforts associated with the development of solid oxide fuel cell stationary power generation and is also reviewed at least annually for impairment.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" (ASC 350) permits the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test required under ASC 350.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill and in-process research and development assets as of July 31, 2022. The Company performed a qualitative assessment for fiscal year 2022 and determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets (including Project Assets)\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group which pertain to specific projects may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable, we compare the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding debt service costs, expected to be generated by the asset group and their ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group. During the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded certain project asset impairment charges.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognized revenue in accordance with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the amount of revenue recognized for any goods or services reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied.\nA contract is accounted for when there has been approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Performance obligations under a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. In certain instances, the Company has concluded distinct goods or services should be accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct goods or services that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (the goods or services are distinct) and if the promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (the goods or services are distinct in the context of the contract). If these criteria are not met, the promised services are accounted for as a single performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration that the Company will be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price, generally utilizing the expected value method. Determining the transaction price requires judgment. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling price is determined by the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. In addition, the Companys contracts with customers generally do not include significant financing components or non-cash consideration. The Company has elected practical expedients in the accounting guidance that allow for revenue to be recorded in the amount that the Company has a right to invoice, if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Companys performance to date, and that allow the Company not to disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations. The Company records any amounts that are billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue and revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed to customers as unbilled receivables.\nRevenue streams are classified as follows:\nProduct. Includes the sale of completed project assets, sale and installation of fuel cell power platforms including site engineering and construction services, and the sale of modules, BOP components and spare parts to customers.\nService. Includes performance under long-term service agreements for power platforms owned by third parties.\nLicense and royalty. Includes license fees and royalty income from the licensure of intellectual property.\nGeneration. Includes the sale of electricity under PPAs and utility tariffs from project assets retained by the Company. This also includes revenue received from the sale of other value streams from these assets including the sale of heat, steam, capacity and renewable energy credits.\nAdvanced Technologies. Includes revenue from customer-sponsored and government-sponsored Advanced Technologies projects.\nSee below for a discussion of revenue recognition under Topic 606 by disaggregated revenue stream.\nCompleted project assets\nContracts for the sale of completed project assets include the sale of the project asset, the assignment of the service agreement, and the assignment of the PPA. The relative stand-alone selling price is estimated and is used as the basis for allocation of the contract consideration. Revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations, which includes the transfer of control of the project asset to the customer, which is when the contract is signed and the PPA is assigned to the customer. See below for further discussion regarding revenue recognition for service agreements.\nContractual payments related to the sale of the project asset and assignment of the PPA are generally received up-front. Payment terms for service agreements are generally ratable over the term of the agreement.\nModule Sales\nContracts for module sales represent the sale of a completed fuel cell module at a contracted selling price. These contracts are on a per unit basis and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed and ready to ship and the performance obligation is satisfied. Payment terms for module sales are generally based on milestones achieved through the manufacturing timeline of the module.\nService agreements\nService agreements represent a single performance obligation whereby the Company performs all required maintenance and monitoring functions, including replacement of modules, to ensure the power platform(s) under the service agreement generate a minimum power output. To the extent the power platform(s) under service agreements do not achieve the minimum power output, certain service agreements include a performance guarantee penalty. Performance guarantee penalties represent variable consideration, which is estimated for each service agreement based on past experience, using the expected value method. The consideration for each service agreement is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress.\nThe Company reviews its cost estimates on service agreements on a quarterly basis and records any changes in estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nLoss accruals for service agreements are recognized to the extent that the estimated remaining costs to satisfy the performance obligation exceed the estimated remaining unrecognized consideration. Estimated losses are recognized in the period in which losses are identified.\nPayment terms for service agreements are generally ratable over the term of the agreement.\nAdvanced Technologies contracts\nAdvanced Technologies contracts include the promise to perform research and development services and, as such, this represents one performance obligation. Revenue from most government sponsored Advanced Technologies projects is recognized as direct costs are incurred plus allowable overhead less cost share requirements, if any. Revenue is only recognized to the extent the contracts are funded. Revenue from previous fixed price Advanced Technologies projects is recognized using the cost-to-cost input method. Revenue recognition for research performed under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement (as defined elsewhere herein) also falls into the practical expedient category where revenue is recorded consistent with the amounts that are to be invoiced.\nPayments are based on costs incurred for government sponsored Advanced Technologies projects and upon completion of milestones for previous fixed-price Advanced Technologies projects. Payments under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement are based on time spent and material costs incurred.\nLicense agreements\nThe Company entered into the License Agreements (as defined elsewhere herein) with POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy) in 2007, 2009 and 2012. In December 2021, the License Agreements were deemed amended pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement among the Company, POSCO Energy, and KFC (for more information, refer to Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nPrior to the date of the Settlement Agreement, in connection with the adoption of Topic 606, several performance obligations were identified under the License Agreements, including previously satisfied performance obligations for the transfer of licensed intellectual property, two performance obligations for specified upgrades of the previously licensed intellectual property, a performance obligation to deliver unspecified upgrades to the previously licensed intellectual property on a when-and-if-available basis, and a performance obligation to provide technical support for previously delivered intellectual property.\n\u25cf The performance obligations related to the specified upgrades would have been satisfied and the related consideration recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the specified upgrades. The Company did not recognize any revenue in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 related to specified upgrades.\n\u25cf The performance obligations for unspecified upgrades and technical support were being recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term on the basis that this represented the method that best depicted the progress towards completion of the related performance obligations. The Company recognized revenue totaling $0.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2020 related to unspecified upgrades and technical support.\nAll fixed consideration for the License Agreements was previously collected. The Company discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then pending arbitrations.\nThe Company entered into the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement on November 5, 2019. The Company recorded license revenue of $4.0 million in association with this agreement for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 which revenue was considered at a point-in-time upon the signing of the contract as the license is considered functional intellectual property because it has standalone functionality. The customer can use this intellectual property as it exists at a point in time and no further services are required from the Company.\nGeneration revenue\nFor certain project assets where customers purchase electricity from the Company under PPAs, the Company has determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 842, Leases. Revenue is recognized when electricity has been delivered based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Generation sales, to the extent the related PPAs are within the scope of Topic 606, are recognized as revenue in the period in which the Company provides the electricity and completes the performance obligation, which is the same as the monthly amount billed to customers.\nVariable Interest Entity and Noncontrolling Interests\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in August 2021 for the 7.4 MW fuel cell project (the Groton Project) located on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT, which has been structured as a partnership flip. A partnership (the Groton Partnership) was organized with East West Bancorp, Inc. (East West Bank) to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, all of the outstanding equity interests in Groton Station Fuel Cell, LLC (Groton Project Company). East West Bank has a conditional withdrawal right which they can exercise and which would require the Company to pay 101% of the amount contributed by East West Bank to date. In addition, under this partnership flip structure, the Company has an option to acquire all of the equity interests that East West Bank holds in the Groton Partnership starting approximately five and a half years after the Groton Project is operational. If the Company exercises this option, the exercise price to be paid by the Company will be the greater of (1) the fair market value of East West Banks equity interest at the time the option is exercised, (2) five percent of the $15 million tax equity commitment and (3) East West Banks claim in liquidation determined using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.\nThe Groton Partnership is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) under U.S. GAAP. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary in the Groton Partnership for accounting purposes. The Company has considered the provisions within the financing-related agreements (including the limited liability company agreement for the Groton Partnership) which grant the Company power to manage and make decisions affecting the operations of the Groton Partnership. The Company considers the rights granted to East West Bank under the agreements to be more protective in nature than participatory. Therefore, the Company has determined under the power and benefits criterion of Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations that it is the primary beneficiary of the Groton Partnership. As the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates in its consolidated financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Groton Partnership, and all intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and the Groton Partnership are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized East West Banks share of the net assets of the Groton Partnership, which is $3.0 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, as a noncontrolling interest in mezzanine equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to do so until the conditional withdrawal period lapses at the commencement of operations. Upon commencement of operations of the related project asset, the Company expects to allocate profits and losses to the noncontrolling interest under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") method. HLBV is a balance sheet-oriented approach for allocating net income or loss to the noncontrolling interest when there is a complex structure, such as the partnership flip structure.\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in November 2021 with Renewable Energy Investors, LLC (REI), a subsidiary of Franklin Park Infrastructure, LLC, for the 7.4 MW fuel cell project (the LIPA Yaphank Project) located in Yaphank Long Island. REIs tax equity commitment totaled $12.4 million. This transaction was structured as a partnership flip, which is a structure commonly used by tax equity investors in the financing of renewable energy projects. Under this partnership flip structure, a partnership, in this case YTBFC Holdco, LLC (the Yaphank Partnership), was organized to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, all outstanding equity interests in Yaphank Fuel Cell Park, LLC which in turn owns the LIPA Yaphank Project and is the party to the power purchase agreement and all project agreements. REI holds Class A Units in the Yaphank Partnership and a subsidiary of the Company holds the Class B Units.\nUnder a partnership flip structure, tax equity investors agree to receive a minimum target rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis. Prior to receiving a contractual rate of return or a date specified in the contractual arrangements, REI will receive substantially all of the non-cash value attributable to the LIPA Yaphank Project, which includes accelerated depreciation and Section 48(a) investment tax credits; however, the Company will receive a majority of the cash distributions (based on the operating income of the LIPA Yaphank Project), which are paid quarterly. After REI receives its contractual rate of return, the Company will receive approximately 95% of the cash and tax allocations. The Company may enter into a back leverage debt financing transaction and use the cash distributions from the Yaphank Partnership to service the debt.\nThe Yaphank Partnership is a VIE under U.S. GAAP. The Company has considered the provisions within the financing-related agreements (including the limited liability company agreement for the Yaphank Partnership) which grant us power to manage and make decisions affecting the operations of the Yaphank Partnership. We consider the rights granted to REI under the agreements to be more protective in nature than participatory. Therefore, we have determined under the power and benefits criterion of ASC 810, Consolidations that we are the primary beneficiary of the Yaphank Partnership. As the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Yaphank Partnership\nin our consolidated financial statements, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and the Yaphank Partnership are eliminated. The Company recognized REIs share of the net assets of the Yaphank Partnership as noncontrolling interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The income or loss allocations reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss may create volatility in our reported results of operations, including potentially changing net loss attributable to stockholders to net income attributable to stockholders, or vice versa, from quarter to quarter. The Company allocates profits and losses to REIs noncontrolling interest under the HLBV method.\nSee Note. 3 Tax Equity Financing for additional information regarding the tax equity financing transactions with East West Bank and REI.\nSale-Leaseback Accounting\nThe Company, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, has entered into sale-leaseback transactions for commissioned project assets where we have entered into a PPA with a customer who is both the site host and end user of the power. Due to the Company not meeting criteria to account for the transfer of the project assets as a sale, sale accounting is precluded. Accordingly, the Company uses the financing method to account for these transactions.\nUnder the financing method of accounting for a sale-leaseback, the Company does not derecognize the project assets and does not recognize as revenue any of the sale proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitutes payment to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements. Instead, the sale proceeds received are accounted for as finance obligations and leaseback payments made by the Company are allocated between interest expense and a reduction to the finance obligation. Interest on the finance obligation is calculated using the Companys incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the arrangement on the outstanding finance obligation. While we receive financing for the related project asset, we have not recognized revenue on the sale-leaseback transactions. Instead, revenue is recognized with respect to the related PPAs in accordance with the Companys accounting policies for recognizing generation revenues.\nInventories\nInventories consist principally of raw materials and work-in-process. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. Included in our inventory balance are used modules that are brought back into inventory upon installation of new modules. When a new module is installed, a determination is made as to whether the module has remaining useful life or should be scrapped and materials recycled. Modules that are deemed to have remaining useful life are put into inventory at an estimated value based on the expected remaining life of the module and its projected output. Inventories are reviewed to determine if valuation allowances are required for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory. This review includes analyzing inventory levels of individual parts considering the current design of our products and production requirements as well as the expected inventory requirements for maintenance on installed power platforms and inventory will be recorded at a new cost basis if a valuation allowance is required.\nService Expense Recognition\nWe have entered into service agreements with certain customers to provide monitoring, maintenance and repair services for fuel cell power platforms. Under the terms of these service agreements, the power platform must meet a minimum operating output during the term. If the minimum output falls below the contract requirement, we may be subject to performance penalties or may be required to repair and/or replace the customers fuel cell module(s).\nThe Company records loss accruals for service agreements when the estimated cost of future module exchanges and maintenance and monitoring activities exceeds the remaining unrecognized contract value. Estimates for future costs on service agreements are determined by a number of factors including the estimated remaining life of the module(s), used replacement modules available, and future operating plans for the power platform. Our estimates are performed on a contract by contract basis and include cost assumptions based on what we anticipate the service requirements will be to fulfill obligations for each contract. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, our loss accruals on service agreements totaled $7.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively.\nACCOUNTING GUIDANCE UPDATE\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThere is no recently adopted accounting guidance applicable to the Companys financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective\nThere is no recent accounting guidance not yet effective that is expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements when adopted. Item 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nInterest Rate Exposure Risk\nCash is invested overnight with high credit quality financial institutions and therefore we are not exposed to market risk on our cash holdings from changing interest rates. Based on our overall interest rate exposure as of October 31, 2022, including all interest rate sensitive instruments, a change in interest rates of 1% would not have a material impact on our results of operations.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nAs of October 31, 2022, approximately 0.3% of our total cash and cash equivalents were in currencies other than U.S. dollars (primarily the Euro, Canadian dollars and Korean Won) and we have no plans of repatriation. We make purchases from certain vendors in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Although we have not experienced significant foreign exchange rate losses to date, we may in the future, especially to the extent that we do not engage in currency hedging activities. The economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies.\nDerivative Fair Value Exposure Risk\nInterest Rate Swap\nOn May 16, 2019, an interest rate swap agreement was entered into with Fifth Third Bank in connection with the BFC Credit Agreement for the term of the loan. The net interest rate across the BFC Credit Agreement and the swap transaction results in a fixed rate of 5.09%. The interest rate swap is adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis. The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs including primarily the forward LIBOR curve available to swap dealers. The valuation methodology involves comparison of (i) the sum of the present value of all monthly variable rate payments based on a reset rate using the forward LIBOR curve and (ii) the sum of the present value of all monthly fixed rate payments on the notional amount, which is equivalent to the outstanding principal amount of the loan. On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its interest rate swap agreement that replaced LIBOR with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) effective as of June 2023. The fair value adjustment for the years ended October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 resulted in a $0.9 million gain and a $0.5 million gain, respectively.\nProject Fuel Price Exposure Risk\nCertain of our PPAs for project assets in our generation operating portfolio and project assets under construction expose us to fluctuating fuel price risks as well as the risk of being unable to procure the required amounts of fuel and the lack of alternative available fuel sources. We seek to mitigate our fuel risk using strategies including: (i) fuel cost reimbursement mechanisms in our PPAs to allow for pass through of fuel costs (full or partial) where possible, which we have done with our 14.9 MW operating project in Bridgeport, CT; (ii) procuring fuel under fixed price physical contracts with investment grade counterparties, which we have done for twenty years for our Tulare BioMAT project and the initial seven years of the 18 year PPA for our LIPA Yaphank, NY project; and (iii) potentially entering into future financial hedges with investment grade counterparties to offset potential negative market fluctuations.\nWe currently have three projects in development with fuel sourcing risk, namely, the Toyota project, which requires procurement of renewable natural gas (RNG), and our Derby, CT 14.0 MW and 2.8 MW projects, both of which require natural gas for which there is no pass though mechanism in the related PPAs. Fuel sourcing and risk mitigation strategies for all three projects are being assessed and will be implemented as project operational dates become firm.\nHistorically, this risk has not been material to our financial statements as our operating projects prior to October 31, 2022 either did not have fuel price risk exposure, had fuel cost reimbursement mechanisms in our related PPAs to allow for pass through of fuel costs (full or partial), or had established long term fixed price fuel physical contracts. To provide a meaningful assessment of the fuel price risk arising from price movements of natural gas, the Company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in natural gas commodity pricing would have on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss (assuming that all projects with fuel price risk were operating). A $1/Metric Million British Thermal Unit (MMBTu) increase in market pricing compared to our underlying project models\nwould result in a cost impact of approximately $1.4 million to our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss on an annual basis. We have also conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impact of RNG pricing and a $10/MMBTu increase in market pricing compared to our underlying project models would result in an impact of approximately $2.0 million to our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss on an annual basis.

We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management\nand directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEstimated costs at completion for certain service agreements\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys service agreements represent a single performance obligation whereby the Company performs all required maintenance and monitoring functions, including replacement of modules, to ensure the power platforms under the service agreement generate a minimum power output. The consideration for each service agreement is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. The Company had service revenue of $12.9 million for the year ended October 31, 2022.\nWe identified the evaluation of total estimated costs at completion for certain service agreements as a critical audit matter. Specifically, evaluating the Companys total estimated costs at completion required complex auditor judgement to assess the estimated number of fuel cell modules to be replaced during the term of the agreements and their associated costs. These areas involved the application of significant estimation by management and contained significant measurement uncertainty.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys process to develop total estimated costs at completion for service agreements. This included a control related to the estimated number of fuel cell modules to be replaced during the term of the agreement and their associated costs. For certain service agreements, we evaluated the estimated number of fuel cell modules to be replaced and their associated costs by:\n\u25cf comparing the estimated number of fuel cell modules to be replaced to the replacement plan developed and maintained by the Companys service department\n\u25cf comparing the total estimated costs to manufacture fuel cell modules to historical actual costs\n\u25cf comparing current period total estimated costs at completion to previous total estimated costs at completion and assessing the cause of certain revisions\n\u25cf assessing the number of fuel cell module replacements that are expected to occur during the contract term using the useful life of fuel cell modules.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1995.\nHartford, Connecticut\nDecember 20, 2022\nFUELCELL ENERGY, INC.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nOctober 31, 2022 and 2021\n(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents, unrestricted\n$\n458,055\n$\n432,213\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - short-term\n4,423\n11,268\nAccounts receivable, net\n4,885\n14,730\nUnbilled receivables\n11,019\n8,924\nInventories\n90,909\n67,074\nOther current assets\n10,989\n9,177\nTotal current assets\n580,280\n543,386\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents - long-term\n18,566\n16,731\nInventories - long-term\n7,549\n4,586\nProject assets, net\n232,886\n223,277\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n58,137\n39,416\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n7,189\n8,109\nGoodwill\n4,075\n4,075\nIntangible assets, net\n17,373\n18,670\nOther assets\n13,662\n16,998\nTotal assets (1)\n$\n939,717\n$\n875,248\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n13,198\n$\n10,085\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities\n1,032\nAccounts payable\n28,196\n19,267\nAccrued liabilities\n27,415\n16,099\nDeferred revenue\n16,341\n6,287\nTotal current liabilities\n85,800\n52,770\nLong-term deferred revenue and customer deposits\n9,095\n30,427\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n7,575\n8,093\nLong-term debt and other liabilities\n82,863\n78,633\nTotal liabilities (1)\n185,333\n169,923\nRedeemable Series B preferred stock (liquidation preference of $64,020 as of\nOctober 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021)\n59,857\n59,857\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n3,030\n3,030\nTotal equity:\nStockholders equity:\nCommon stock ($0.0001 par value); 500,000,000 shares authorized as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021; 405,562,988 and 366,618,693 shares issued and outstanding as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively\nAdditional paid-in capital\n2,094,076\n1,908,471\nAccumulated deficit\n(1,407,973)\n(1,265,251)\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n(1,752)\n(819)\nTreasury stock, Common, at cost (142,837 and 73,430 shares as of October 31, 2022\nand October 31, 2021, respectively)\n(855)\n(586)\nDeferred compensation\nTotal stockholder's equity\n684,392\n642,438\nNoncontrolling interest\n7,105\n-\nTotal equity\n691,497\n642,438\nTotal liabilities, redeemable noncontrolling interests and stockholders' equity\n$\n939,717\n$\n875,248\n(1) As of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, the consolidated assets of the variable interest entity (VIE) were $119,223 and $54,375, respectively, that can only be used to settle obligations of the VIE.

Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Business and Basis of Presentation\nHeadquartered in Danbury, Connecticut, FuelCell Energy, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company, FuelCell Energy, we, us, or our) has leveraged five decades of research and development to become a global leader in delivering environmentally responsible distributed baseload power platform solutions through our proprietary fuel cell technology. Our current commercial technology produces electricity, heat, hydrogen, and water while separating carbon for utilization and/or sequestration. We continue to invest in developing and commercializing future technologies expected to add new capabilities to our platforms abilities to deliver hydrogen and long duration hydrogen-based energy storage through our solid oxide technologies, as well as further enhance our existing platforms carbon capture solutions.\nFuelCell Energy is a global leader in sustainable clean energy technologies that address some of the worlds most critical challenges around energy access, security, safety and environmental stewardship. As a leading global manufacturer of proprietary fuel cell technology platforms, FuelCell Energy is uniquely positioned to serve customers worldwide with sustainable products and solutions for industrial and commercial businesses, utilities, governments, and municipalities.\nThe consolidated financial statements include our accounts, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those of our consolidated variable interest entities. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nLiquidity\nOur principal sources of cash have been sales of our common stock through public equity offerings, proceeds from debt, project financing and tax monetization transactions, proceeds from the sale of our products and projects, as well as research and development and service agreements with third parties. We have utilized this cash to develop and construct project assets, invest in capital improvements and expansion of our operations, perform research and development on Advanced Technologies, pay down existing outstanding indebtedness, and meet our other cash and liquidity needs.\nAs of October 31, 2022, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $458.1 million compared to $432.2 million as of October 31, 2021.\nIn February 2021, the Company further reduced its debt by repaying the outstanding $6.5 million Paycheck Protection Program Promissory Note from Liberty Bank under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act.\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Canaccord Genuity LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Loop Capital Markets LLC (the Open Market Sale Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell up to 95.0 million shares of the Companys common stock. From the date of the Open Market Sale Agreement through October 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 18.5 million shares under the Open Market Sale Agreement at an average sale price of $3.63 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of approximately $67.2 million before deducting sales commissions and fees. There were no sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, but there were sales in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 that settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 (as described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2022). The Company currently intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to accelerate the development and commercialization of its product platforms (including, but not limited to, its solid oxide and carbon capture platforms), for project development, market development, and internal research and development, to invest in capacity expansion for solid oxide and carbonate fuel cell manufacturing, and for project financing, working capital support, and general corporate purposes. The Company may also use the net proceeds from this offering to invest in joint ventures, acquisitions, and strategic growth investments and to acquire, license or invest in products, technologies or businesses that complement its business. See Note 11. Stockholders Equity and Warrant Liabilities for additional information regarding the Open Market Sale Agreement.\nOn June 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the 2021 Sales Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company could, from time to time, offer and sell shares of the Companys common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. From the date of the 2021 Sales Agreement through April 30, 2022, approximately 64.0 million shares of the Companys common stock were sold under the 2021 Sales Agreement, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of\napproximately $498.1 million before deducting sales commissions. Commissions of approximately $10.0 million in the aggregate were paid to Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. in connection with these sales, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $488.1 million. No sales of common stock were made under the 2021 Sales Agreement after April 30, 2022, and no additional sales of common stock can or will be made under the 2021 Sales Agreement, as the Company, Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. mutually agreed to terminate the 2021 Sales Agreement as of July 12, 2022.\nWe believe that our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, expected receipts from our contracted backlog, and release of short-term restricted cash less expected disbursements over the next twelve months will be sufficient to allow the Company to meet its obligations for at least one year from the date of issuance of these financial statements.\nTo date, we have not achieved profitable operations or sustained positive cash flow from operations. The Companys future liquidity, for fiscal year 2023 and in the long-term, will depend on its ability to (i) timely complete current projects in process within budget, (ii) increase cash flows from its generation operating portfolio, including by meeting conditions required to timely commence operation of new projects, operating its generation operating portfolio in compliance with minimum performance guarantees and operating its generation operating portfolio in accordance with revenue expectations, (iii) obtain financing for project construction and manufacturing expansion, (iv) obtain permanent financing for its projects once constructed, (v) increase order and contract volumes, which would lead to additional product sales, service agreements and generation revenues, (vi) obtain funding for and receive payment for research and development under current and future Advanced Technologies contracts, (vii) successfully commercialize its Advanced Technologies platforms, including its solid oxide, hydrogen and carbon capture platforms, (viii) implement capacity expansion for solid oxide product manufacturing, (ix) implement the product cost reductions necessary to achieve profitable operations, (x) manage working capital and the Companys unrestricted cash balance and (xi) access the capital markets to raise funds through the sale of debt and equity securities, convertible notes, and other equity-linked instruments.\nWe are continually assessing different means by which to accelerate the Companys growth, enter new markets, commercialize new products, and enable capacity expansion. Therefore, from time to time, the Company may consider and enter into agreements for one or more of the following: negotiated financial transactions, minority investments, collaborative ventures, technology sharing, transfer or other technology license arrangements, joint ventures, partnerships, acquisitions or other business transactions for the purpose(s) of geographic or manufacturing expansion and/or new product or technology development and commercialization, including hydrogen production and storage and carbon capture, sequestration and utilization technologies.\nOur business model requires substantial outside financing arrangements and satisfaction of the conditions of such arrangements to construct and deploy our projects to facilitate the growth of our business. The Company has invested capital raised from sales of its common stock to build out its project portfolio. The Company has also utilized and expects to continue to utilize a combination of long-term debt and tax equity financing (e.g., sale-leaseback and partnership transactions) to finance its project asset portfolio as these projects commence commercial operations. The Company may also seek to undertake private placements of debt securities of a portfolio of assets to finance its project asset portfolio. The proceeds of any such financing, if obtained, may allow the Company to reinvest capital back into the business and to fund other projects. We may also seek to obtain additional financing in both the debt and equity markets in the future. If financing is not available to us on acceptable terms if and when needed, or on terms acceptable to us or our lenders, if we do not satisfy the conditions of our financing arrangements, if we spend more than the financing approved for projects, if project costs exceed an amount that the Company can finance, or if we do not generate sufficient revenues or obtain capital sufficient for our corporate needs, we may be required to reduce or slow planned spending, reduce staffing, sell assets, seek alternative financing and take other measures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll cash equivalents consist of investments in money market funds with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition. We place our temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions.\nInventories and Advance Payments to Vendors\nInventories consist principally of raw materials and work-in-process. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out cost method. Included in our inventory balance are used modules that are brought back into inventory upon installation of new modules. When a new module is installed, a determination is made as to whether the used module has remaining useful life or should be scrapped and materials recycled. Modules that are deemed to have remaining useful life are put into inventory at an estimated value based on the expected remaining life of the module and its projected output. In certain circumstances, we will make advance payments to vendors for future inventory deliveries. These advance payments are recorded as Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventories are reviewed to determine net realizable value. This review includes analyzing inventory levels of individual parts considering the current design of our products and production requirements as well as the expected inventory requirements for maintenance on installed power platforms.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts and Credit Losses\nThe Company had no allowance for doubtful accounts or credit losses as of October 31, 2022 and 2021. Uncollectible accounts receivable are charged against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all collection efforts have failed and it is deemed unlikely that the amount will be recovered. The Company would record a specific reserve for individual accounts when the Company becomes aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or the deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position.\nProject Assets\nProject assets consist of capitalized costs for fuel cell projects in various stages of development, including those projects with respect to which we have entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs), those projects with respect to which we expect to secure long-term contracts and those projects retained by the Company under a merchant model. Such development costs are generally incurred prior to entering into a definitive sales or long-term financing agreement for the project. Project assets also include capitalized costs for fuel cell projects which are the subject of a sale-leaseback transaction with PNC Energy Capital, LLC (PNC) or Crestmark Equipment Finance, a division of MetaBank (Crestmark). Project asset costs include costs for developing and constructing a complete turn-key fuel cell project. Development costs can include legal, consulting, permitting, interconnect, and other similar costs. To the extent we enter into a definitive sales agreement, we expense project assets to cost of sales after the respective project asset is sold to a customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation which is recorded based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized on the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease. When property is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations for the period.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles\nGoodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. The intangible asset represents indefinite-lived in-process research and development for cumulative research and development efforts associated with the development of solid oxide fuel cell stationary power generation and is also reviewed at least annually for impairment.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" (ASC 350) permits the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test required under ASC 350.\nThe Company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill and the in-process research & development asset (IPR&D) as of July 31, 2022. The goodwill and IPR&D asset are both held by the Companys Versa Power Systems, Inc. (Versa) reporting unit. Goodwill and the IPR&D asset are also reviewed for possible impairment whenever changes in\nconditions indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit or IPR&D asset is more likely than not below its carrying value. No impairment charges were recorded with respect to goodwill or the IPR&D asset during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets (including Project Assets)\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group which pertains to specific projects may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable, we compare the carrying amount of an asset group to future undiscounted net cash flows, excluding debt service costs, expected to be generated by the asset group and their ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). Under Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the amount of revenue recognized for any goods or services reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods and services. To achieve this core principle, the Company applies the following five-step approach: (1) identify the contract with the customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when or as a performance obligation is satisfied.\nA contract is accounted for when there has been approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. Performance obligations under a contract are identified based on the goods or services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct and are distinct in the context of the contract. In certain instances, the Company has concluded distinct goods or services should be accounted for as a single performance obligation that is a series of distinct goods or services that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. To the extent a contract includes multiple promised goods or services, the Company must apply judgment to determine whether the customer can benefit from the goods or services either on their own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (the goods or services are distinct) and if the promise to transfer the goods or services to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (the goods or services are distinct in the context of the contract). If these criteria are not met, the promised services are accounted for as a single performance obligation. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration that the Company will be entitled to in exchange for transferring goods or services to the customer. To the extent the transaction price includes variable consideration, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration that should be included in the transaction price, generally utilizing the expected value method. Determining the transaction price requires judgment. If the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling price is determined by the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the standalone selling price by taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. Performance obligations are satisfied either over time or at a point in time as discussed in further detail below. In addition, the Companys contracts with customers generally do not include significant financing components or non-cash consideration. The Company has elected practical expedients in the accounting guidance that allow for revenue to be recorded in the amount that the Company has a right to invoice, if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Companys performance to date, and that allow the Company not to disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations. The Company records any amounts that are billed to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue and revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed to customers as unbilled receivables.\nRevenue streams are classified as follows:\nProduct. Includes the sale of completed project assets, sale and installation of fuel cell power platforms including site engineering and construction services, and the sale of modules, balance of plant (BOP) components and spare parts to customers.\nService. Includes performance under long-term service agreements for power platforms owned by third parties.\nLicense and royalty. Includes license fees and royalty income from the licensure of intellectual property.\nGeneration. Includes the sale of electricity under PPAs and utility tariffs from project assets retained by the Company. This also includes revenue received from the sale of other value streams from these assets including the sale of heat, steam, capacity and renewable energy credits.\nAdvanced Technologies. Includes revenue from customer-sponsored and government-sponsored Advanced Technologies projects.\nSee below for a discussion of revenue recognition under Topic 606 by disaggregated revenue stream.\nCompleted project assets\nContracts for the sale of completed project assets include the sale of the project asset, the assignment of the service agreement, and the assignment of the PPA. The relative stand-alone selling price is estimated and is used as the basis for allocation of the contract consideration. Revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of the performance obligations, which includes the transfer of control of the project asset to the customer, which is when the contract is signed and the PPA is assigned to the customer. See below for further discussion regarding revenue recognition for service agreements.\nContractual payments related to the sale of the project asset and assignment of the PPA are generally received up-front. Payment terms for service agreements are generally ratable over the term of the agreement.\nModule Sales\nContracts for module sales represent the sale of a completed fuel cell module at a contracted selling price. These contracts are on a per unit basis and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed and ready to ship and the performance obligation is satisfied. Payment terms for the module sale are based on milestones achieved through the manufacturing timeline of the module.\nService agreements\nService agreements represent a single performance obligation whereby the Company performs all required maintenance and monitoring functions, including replacement of modules, to ensure the power platform(s) under the service agreement generate a minimum power output. To the extent the power platform(s) under service agreements do not achieve the minimum power output, certain service agreements include a performance guarantee penalty. Performance guarantee penalties represent variable consideration, which is estimated for each service agreement based on past experience, using the expected value method. The consideration for each service agreement is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress.\nThe Company reviews its cost estimates on service agreements on a quarterly basis and records any changes in estimates on a cumulative catch-up basis.\nLoss accruals for service agreements are recognized to the extent that the estimated remaining costs to satisfy the performance obligation exceed the estimated remaining unrecognized consideration. Estimated losses are recognized in the period in which losses are identified.\nPayment terms for service agreements are generally ratable over the term of the agreement.\nAdvanced Technologies contracts\nAdvanced Technologies contracts include the promise to perform research and development services and, as such, this represents one performance obligation. Revenue from most government sponsored Advanced Technologies projects is recognized as direct costs are incurred plus allowable overhead less cost share requirements, if any. Revenue is only recognized to the extent the contracts are funded. Revenue from previous fixed price Advanced Technologies projects is recognized using the cost-to-cost input method. Revenue recognition for research performed under the EMTEC Joint\nDevelopment Agreement (as defined elsewhere herein) also falls into the practical expedient category where revenue is recorded consistent with the amounts that are to be invoiced.\nPayments are based on costs incurred for government sponsored Advanced Technologies projects and upon completion of milestones for previous fixed-price Advanced Technologies projects. Payments under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement are based on time spent and material costs incurred.\nLicense agreements\nThe Company entered into the License Agreements (as defined elsewhere herein) with POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy) in 2007, 2009 and 2012. In June 2020, the Company notified POSCO Energy that it was terminating the License Agreements and POSCO Energy disputed such termination (for more information, refer to Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies).\nPrior to the date of the Companys notice of termination, in connection with the adoption of Topic 606, several performance obligations were identified under the License Agreements, including previously satisfied performance obligations for the transfer of licensed intellectual property, two performance obligations for specified upgrades of the previously licensed intellectual property, a performance obligation to deliver unspecified upgrades to the previously licensed intellectual property on a when-and-if-available basis, and a performance obligation to provide technical support for previously delivered intellectual property.\n\u25cf The performance obligations related to the specified upgrades would have been satisfied and the related consideration recognized as revenue upon the delivery of the specified upgrades. The Company did not recognize any revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 related to specified upgrades.\n\u25cf The performance obligations for unspecified upgrades and technical support were being recognized on a straight-line basis over the license term on the basis that this represented the method that best depicted the progress towards completion of the related performance obligations. The Company recognized revenue totaling $0.8 million for the year ended October 31, 2020 related to unspecified upgrades and technical support.\nAll fixed consideration for the License Agreements was previously collected. The Company discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then pending arbitrations.\nThe Company entered into the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement on November 5, 2019. The Company recorded license revenue of $4.0 million in association with this agreement for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 which revenue was considered at a point-in-time upon the signing of the contract as the license is considered functional intellectual property because it has standalone functionality. The customer can use this intellectual property as it exists at a point in time and no further services are required from the Company.\nGeneration revenue\nFor certain project assets where customers purchase electricity from the Company under PPAs, the Company has determined that these agreements should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 842, Leases. Revenue is recognized when electricity has been delivered based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Generation sales, to the extent the related PPAs are within the scope of Topic 606, are recognized as revenue in the period in which the Company provides the electricity and completes the performance obligation, which is the same as the monthly amount billed to customers.\nVariable Interest Entities and Noncontrolling Interests\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in August 2021 for the 7.4 MW fuel cell project (the Groton Project) located on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT, which has been structured as a partnership flip. A partnership (the Groton Partnership) was organized with East West Bancorp, Inc. (East West Bank) to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, all of the outstanding equity interests in Groton Station Fuel Cell, LLC (the Groton Project Company). East West Bank has a conditional withdrawal right which\nthey can exercise and which would require the Company to pay 101% of the amount contributed by East West Bank to date. In addition, under this partnership flip structure, the Company has an option to acquire all of the equity interests that East West Bank holds in the Groton Partnership starting approximately five and a half years after the Groton Project is operational. If the Company exercises this option, the exercise price to be paid by the Company will be the greater of (1) the fair market value of East West Banks equity interest at the time the option is exercised, (2) five percent of the $15 million tax equity commitment and (3) East West Banks claim in liquidation determined using the hypothetical liquidation at book value method.\nThe Groton Partnership is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) under U.S. GAAP. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary in the Groton Partnership for accounting purposes. The Company has considered the provisions within the financing-related agreements (including the limited liability company agreement for the Groton Partnership) which grant the Company power to manage and make decisions affecting the operations of the Groton Partnership. The Company considers the rights granted to East West Bank under the agreements to be more protective in nature than participatory. Therefore, the Company has determined under the power and benefits criterion of Accounting Standards Codification 810, Consolidations (ASC 810) that it is the primary beneficiary of the Groton Partnership. As the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates in its consolidated financial statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Groton Partnership, and all intercompany balances and transactions between the Company and the Groton Partnership are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized East West Banks share of the net assets of the Groton Partnership, which was $3.0 million as of each of October 31, 2022 and 2021, as a noncontrolling interest in mezzanine equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and will continue to do so until the conditional withdrawal period lapses upon commencement of operations. Upon commencement of operations of the related project asset, the Company expects to allocate profits and losses to the noncontrolling interest under the hypothetical liquidation at book value (\"HLBV\") method. HLBV is a balance sheet-oriented approach for allocating net income or loss to the noncontrolling interest when there is a complex structure, such as the partnership flip structure.\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in November 2021 with Renewable Energy Investors, LLC (REI), a subsidiary of Franklin Park Infrastructure, LLC, for the 7.4 MW fuel cell project (the LIPA Yaphank Project) located in Yaphank Long Island. REIs tax equity commitment totaled $12.4 million. This transaction was structured as a partnership flip, which is a structure commonly used by tax equity investors in the financing of renewable energy projects. Under this partnership flip structure, a partnership, in this case YTBFC Holdco, LLC (the Yaphank Partnership), was organized to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, all outstanding equity interests in Yaphank Fuel Cell Park, LLC, which in turn owns the LIPA Yaphank Project and is the party to the power purchase agreement and all project agreements. REI holds Class A Units in the Yaphank Partnership and a subsidiary of the Company holds the Class B Units. Under a partnership flip structure, tax equity investors agree to receive a minimum target rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis. Prior to receiving a contractual rate of return or a date specified in the contractual arrangements, REI will receive substantially all of the non-cash value attributable to the LIPA Yaphank Project, which includes accelerated depreciation and Section 48(a) investment tax credits; however, the Company will receive a majority of the cash distributions (based on the operating income of the LIPA Yaphank Project), which are paid quarterly. After REI receives its contractual rate of return, the Company will receive approximately 95% of the cash and tax allocations. The Company may enter into a back leverage debt financing transaction and use the cash distributions from the Yaphank Partnership to service the debt.\nThe Yaphank Partnership is a VIE under U.S. GAAP. The Company has considered the provisions within the financing-related agreements (including the limited liability company agreement for the Yaphank Partnership) which grant us power to manage and make decisions affecting the operations of the Yaphank Partnership. We consider the rights granted to REI under the agreements to be more protective in nature than participatory. Therefore, we have determined under the power and benefits criterion of ASC 810 that we are the primary beneficiary of the Yaphank Partnership. As the primary beneficiary, we consolidate the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Yaphank Partnership in our consolidated financial statements, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and the Yaphank Partnership are eliminated. The Company recognized REIs share of the net assets of the Yaphank Partnership as noncontrolling interests in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. The income or loss allocations reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss may create volatility in our reported results of operations, including potentially changing net loss attributable to stockholders to net income attributable to stockholders, or vice versa, from quarter to quarter. The Company allocates profits and losses to REIs noncontrolling interest under the HLBV method.\nSale-Leaseback Accounting\nThe Company, through certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, has entered into sale-leaseback transactions for commissioned project assets where we have entered into a PPA with a customer who is both the site host and end user of the power. Due to the Company not meeting criteria to account for the transfer of the project assets as a sale, sale accounting is precluded. Accordingly, the Company uses the financing method to account for these transactions.\nUnder the financing method of accounting for a sale-leaseback, the Company does not derecognize the project assets and does not recognize as revenue any of the sale proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitutes payment to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements. Instead, the sale proceeds received are accounted for as finance obligations and leaseback payments made by the Company are allocated between interest expense and a reduction to the finance obligation. Interest on the finance obligation is calculated using the Companys incremental borrowing rate at the inception of the arrangement on the outstanding finance obligation.\nLease Accounting\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease over the lease term at the commencement date of the lease. As most of the Companys leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the date of adoption in determining the present value of lease payments and used the implicit rate when readily determinable. The Company determined incremental borrowing rates through market sources for secured borrowings including relevant industry rates. The Companys operating lease ROU assets also include any lease pre-payments and exclude lease incentives. Certain of the Companys leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. The Company excludes variable payments from lease ROU assets and lease liabilities to the extent not considered in-substance fixed, and instead, expenses variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short term contracts are not material components of lease expense. The Companys leases generally have remaining lease terms of 1 to 26 years, some of which include options to extend leases. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Companys sole discretion and the Companys lease ROU assets and liabilities reflect only the options the Company is reasonably certain that it will exercise. We do not have leases with residual value guarantees or similar covenants.\nService Expense Recognition\nWe warranty our products for a specific period of time against manufacturing or performance defects. Our U.S. warranty is generally limited to a term of 15 months after shipment or 12 months after acceptance of our products. We accrue for estimated future warranty costs based on historical experience. We also provide for a specific accrual if there is a known issue requiring repair during the warranty period. Estimates used to record warranty accruals are updated as we gain further operating experience.\nIn addition to the standard product warranty, we have entered into service agreements with certain customers to provide monitoring, maintenance and repair services for fuel cell power platforms. Under the terms of these service agreements, the power platform must meet a minimum operating output during the term. If the minimum output falls below the contract requirement, we may be subject to performance penalties or may be required to repair and/or replace the customers fuel cell module(s).\nThe Company records loss accruals for service agreements when the estimated cost of future module exchanges and maintenance and monitoring activities exceeds the remaining unrecognized contract value. Estimates for future costs on service agreements are determined by a number of factors including the estimated remaining life of the module(s), used replacement modules available and future operating plans for the power platform. Our estimates are performed on a contract by contract basis and include cost assumptions based on what we anticipate the service requirements will be to fulfill obligations for each contract.\nAt the end of our service agreements, customers are expected to either renew the service agreement or, based on the Companys rights to title of the module, the module will be returned to the Company as the platform is no longer being maintained.\nResearch and Development Costs\nWe perform both customer-sponsored research and development projects based on contractual agreements with customers and company-sponsored research and development projects.\nCosts incurred for customer-sponsored projects include manufacturing and engineering labor, applicable overhead expenses, materials to build and test prototype units and other costs associated with customer-sponsored research and development contracts. Costs incurred for customer-sponsored projects are recorded as cost of Advanced Technologies contract revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nCosts incurred for company-sponsored research and development projects consist primarily of labor, overhead, materials to build and test prototype units and consulting fees. These costs are recorded as research and development expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nConcentrations\nWe contract with a concentrated number of customers for the sale of our products, for service agreement contracts and for Advanced Technologies contracts. For the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, our top customers accounted for 87%, 79% and 80%, respectively, of our total annual consolidated revenue.\nThe percent of consolidated revenues from each customer for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are presented below.\nKorea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd (KFC)\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nConnecticut Light and Power\n%\n%\n%\nExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company (f/k/a ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company) (EMTEC)\n%\n%\n%\nKorea Southern Power Company (KOSPO)\n%\n%\n-\n%\nU.S. Department of Energy (DOE)\n%\n%\n%\nLong Island Power Authority (LIPA)\n%\n-\n%\n-\n%\nPfizer, Inc.\n%\n%\n%\nUIL Holdings Corporation\n-\n%\n%\n%\nTotal\n%\n%\n%\nDerivatives\nWe do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. The Company has an interest rate swap that is adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis. The fair value adjustment is based on Level 2 inputs including primarily the forward LIBOR curve available to swap dealers. The fair value methodology involves comparison of (i) the sum of the present value of all monthly variable rate payments based on a reset rate using the forward LIBOR curve and (ii) the sum of the present value of all monthly fixed rate payments on the notional amount which is equivalent to the outstanding principal amount of the loan. On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its interest rate swap agreement that replaced LIBOR with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) effective as of June 2023. Refer to Note 10. Debt for further details.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in accounting for, among other things, revenue recognition, lease right-of-use assets and liabilities, contract loss accruals, excess, slow-moving and obsolete inventories, product warranty accruals, loss accruals on service agreements, share-based compensation expense, allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, impairment of goodwill and in-process research and development intangible assets, impairment of long-lived assets (including project assets), and contingencies. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of revisions are reflected in the\nconsolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results in future periods may differ from those estimates.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe translation of the financial statements of FCE Korea Ltd., FCES GmbH and Versa Power Systems Ltd. results in translation gains or losses, which are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity.\nOur Canadian subsidiary, FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd., is financially and operationally integrated and the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. We are also subject to foreign currency transaction gains and losses as certain transactions are denominated in foreign currencies. We recognized net foreign currency transaction (losses) gains of $(0.9) million, $(0.9) million and $0.2 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts have been included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nThere is no recently adopted accounting guidance applicable to the Companys financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Effective\nThere is no recent accounting guidance not yet effective that is expected to have a material impact on the Companys financial statements when adopted.\nNote 2. Revenue Recognition\nContract Balances\nContract assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $20.7 million ($9.7 million long-term) and $20.5 million ($11.6 million long-term), respectively. The contract assets relate to the Companys rights to consideration for work completed but not billed. These amounts are included on a separate line item as Unbilled receivables, and balances expected to be billed later than one year from the balance sheet date are included within Other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. We bill customers for power platform and power platform component sales based on certain contractual milestones being reached. We bill service agreements based on the contract price and billing terms of the contracts. Generally, our Advanced Technologies contracts are billed based on actual revenues recorded, typically in the subsequent month. Some Advanced Technologies contracts are billed based on contractual milestones or costs incurred. The net change in contract assets represents amounts recognized as revenue offset by customer billings. For the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, a total of $5.3 million and $5.2 million, respectively, was transferred to accounts receivable from contract assets recognized at the beginning of the period.\nContract liabilities as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $25.4 million and $36.7 million, respectively. The contract liabilities relate to the advance billings to customers for services that will be recognized over time and in some instances for deferred revenue relating to license performance obligations that will be recognized at a future point in time. The Company discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then pending arbitrations. As of October 31, 2021, $22.2 million related to the License Agreements is included within Long-term deferred revenue on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, $22.2 million related to the POSCO Energy License Agreements was reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits within Long-term deferred revenue and customer deposits on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe net change in contract liabilities represents customer billings offset by revenue recognized.\nContract modification\nAs a result of the settlement reached with POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy) (see Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies for further background), the Company evaluated the License Agreements with POSCO Energy as well as all of the terms of the settlement agreement with POSCO Energy, which was effective December 20, 2021 (the Settlement\nAgreement). As part of this analysis, the Company considered the accounting surrounding the execution of the Settlement Agreement, reviewed all elements related to the License Agreements with POSCO Energy and the Settlement Agreement and considered any potential contingencies in the License Agreements and whether any proceeds were related to the litigation settlement.\nUnder the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company agreed that the License Agreements are not terminated, but instead are deemed to be amended such that POSCO Energy and its subsidiary, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (KFC, and with POSCO Energy, collectively, PE Group), only have the right (i) to provide maintenance and repair services to PE Groups existing customers on existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under long-term service agreements currently in force as well as long-term service agreements that have expired and are pending renewal as of the settlement date (collectively, Existing LTSAs), (ii) to supply replacement modules purchased from the Company only for their existing customers for existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under Existing LTSAs and (iii) to own, operate and maintain all facilities and factories solely for the purposes set forth in (i) and (ii) above (collectively, the Right to Service License) and further agreed to sell modules with a service warranty pursuant to a module sales agreement to be negotiated by the parties after execution of the Settlement Agreement. As such, the Company has considered the execution of the Settlement Agreement to be a contract modification as it results in a change in both the scope and price of a contract with a customer. Therefore, the Company accounted for such modification under the contract modification guidance included within ASC 606 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers). Further, the Company noted that none of the parties to the Settlement Agreement specifically acknowledged any payment of damages or reimbursement of any costs related to the matters settled under the Settlement Agreement, which supports the conclusion that the overall settlement is a form of contract modification. Additionally, the transaction price allocated to the modified contract did not exceed the stand-alone selling prices (SSP) of the performance obligations under the modified contract (i.e., there is no indication of a premium that would indicate that a portion of the transaction price relates to something other than the promised goods or services).\nThe Company has identified two performance obligations in the Settlement Agreement which includes the sale of 20 modules and an option to purchase an additional 14 modules. The Company assessed the SSP of the modules utilizing a cost-plus margin approach to arrive at $3.0 million per module which will be recognized upon transfer of control of such modules to KFC via title transfer consistent with the Companys established revenue recognition policies. The Company is also providing a performance guarantee for up to seven years with each module to cover any annual output penalty that would need to be paid by PE Group to a customer. The Company determined that this performance guarantee represents variable consideration and estimated a value of $0.65 million per module, which resulted in accrual of $13.1 million for the year ended October 31, 2022 upon the sale of twenty modules during the year ended October 31, 2022. This variable consideration will be recognized as revenue if and when it is determined that there are no amounts due under the performance guarantee. In its analysis at the time of execution of the Settlement Agreement, the Company determined that it was probable that KFC would exercise its option to purchase an additional 14 modules (with a performance guarantee) beyond the firm order of 20 modules, to which it is contractually committed. Given that the license rights for which the Company was previously recognizing revenue are no longer in place and the Company now has a new revenue stream from the sale of modules, the $22.2 million of deferred license revenue was recharacterized as a customer deposit, of which $13.1 million was recorded as variable consideration within Long-term debt and other liabilities on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will monitor the variable consideration based on the performance of the modules and revise our estimates as necessary. Should KFCs right to purchase the additional 14 modules expire without being exercised on December 31, 2022, it could result in the Company recognizing revenue for the amount equal to the value of the material right.\nEMTEC Joint Development Agreement\nEffective as of October 31, 2019, the Company entered into a Joint Development Agreement (as amended, the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement) with ExxonMobil Technology and Engineering Company (formerly known as ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company) (EMTEC), pursuant to which the Company has engaged in exclusive research and development efforts with EMTEC to evaluate and develop new and/or improved carbonate fuel cells to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from industrial and power sources, in exchange for (i) payment by EMTEC of certain fees and costs (including research costs of up to $45.0 million) as well as certain milestone-based payments, and (ii) certain licenses.\nIn Amendment No. 1 to the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement (Amendment No. 1), which was executed on October 29, 2021 and effective as of October 31, 2021, the Company and EMTEC agreed, among other things, to extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement for an additional six months ending on April 30, 2022. Amendment No. 1 allowed for the continuation of research intended to enable incorporation of design improvements to Company fuel cell design in order to support a decision to use the improvements in a potential future demonstration of the technology for capturing carbon at ExxonMobils Rotterdam refinery in The Netherlands (such demonstration, the Rotterdam Project) and provided additional time to achieve the first milestone under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement.\nIn a related letter agreement between the Company and EMTEC dated as of October 28, 2021 and executed on October 29, 2021 (the Letter Agreement), the Company agreed to invest with EMTEC in the Rotterdam Project, should EMTEC move forward with the Rotterdam Project. In the Letter Agreement, the Company agreed that, if (i) the Company achieves the first milestone under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement (which the Company achieved in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, resulting in a $5.0 million payment to the Company which the Company received in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022) and (ii) EMTEC and the Company execute a contractual agreement to proceed with the Rotterdam Project (which has not occurred), then at EMTECs option, the Company will either make an investment in the amount of $5.0 million in the Rotterdam Project or discount EMTECs purchase of the Companys fuel cell module and detailed engineering design, as agreed to by the parties, required for the Rotterdam Project by said amount.\nOn April 29, 2022, the Company and EMTEC entered into Amendment No. 2 (Amendment No. 2) to the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement which was effective as of April 30, 2022 and which increased the maximum amount of research costs to be reimbursed by EMTEC from $45.0 million to $50.0 million and extended the term an additional eight months, ending December 31, 2022 (unless terminated earlier). In Amendment No. 2, the Company and EMTEC also agreed to conduct a joint market study, with a target completion date on or before October 31, 2022, to (a) define application opportunities, commercialization strategies, and development requirements, (b) identify partners for potential pilot/demonstration projects and (c) assess fuel cell/stack/module manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction. As of October 31, 2022, the Company and EMTEC were still collaborating on the joint market study, which was completed in early fiscal year 2023.\nDuring the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022, the Company achieved the first technical milestone under the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement and received payment of $5.0 million. The Company has not recognized revenue in connection with this milestone achievement as a result of its agreement, in the Letter Agreement described above, to either make a $5.0 million investment in the Rotterdam Project or discount EMTECs purchase of the Companys fuel cell module and detailed engineering design for the Rotterdam Project by $5.0 million, should the Company enter into a contract with EMTEC to proceed with the Rotterdam Project. The Company will continue to evaluate revenue recognition of this milestone achievement as project negotiations with ExxonMobil (or a subsidiary thereof) evolve.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations are the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. As of October 31, 2022, the Companys total remaining performance obligations for service agreements was $114.0 million, for Advanced Technologies contracts was $22.9 million and for product revenues was $9.1 million. Service revenue in periods in which there are no module exchanges is expected to be relatively consistent from period to period, whereas module exchanges will result in an increase in revenue when replacements occur.\nNote 3. Tax Equity Financing\nGroton Tax Equity Financing Transaction\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in August 2021 with East West Bank for the 7.4 MW Groton Project located on the U.S. Navy Submarine Base in Groton, CT (the Groton Project). East West Banks tax equity commitment totals $15 million.\nThis transaction was structured as a partnership flip, which is a structure commonly used by tax equity investors in the financing of renewable energy projects. Under this partnership flip structure, a partnership, in this case Groton Station Fuel Cell Holdco, LLC (the Groton Partnership), was organized to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, all outstanding equity interests in Groton Station Fuel Cell, LLC (the Groton Project Company) which in turn owns the Groton Project and is the party to the power purchase agreement and all project agreements. At the closing of the transaction, the Groton Partnership is owned by East West Bank, holding Class A Units, and Fuel Cell Energy Finance Holdco, LLC, a subsidiary of FuelCell Energy Finance, LLC, holding Class B Units. The acquisition of the Groton Project Company by the Groton Partnership was funded in part by an initial draw from East West Bank and funds contributed downstream to the Groton Partnership by the Company. The initial closing occurred on August 4, 2021, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (including the receipt of an appraisal and confirmation that the Groton Project would be eligible for the investment tax credit under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). In connection with the initial closing, the Company drew down $3.0 million, of which approximately $0.8 million was used to pay closing costs including appraisal fees, title insurance expenses and legal and consulting fees. Under the original terms of the Companys agreement with East West Bank, the Company would have been eligible to draw the remaining amount of the commitment, approximately $12 million, once the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. In addition, under the original terms of the Companys agreement with East West Bank, the Groton Project had a required commercial operations deadline of October 18, 2021. The significance of the commercial operations deadline is that, if commercial operations were not achieved by such deadline, East West Bank would have the option to require an amount equal to 101% of its investment to be returned. East West Bank granted several extensions of the commercial operations deadline, which collectively extended the deadline to May 15, 2022, in exchange for the Companys agreement to pay fees of $0.4 million in the aggregate. The Company recognized a loss of $30 thousand for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 which is attributable to the noncontrolling interest reflecting the 1% conditional withdrawal.\nOn July 7, 2022, the Company and East West Bank amended their tax equity financing agreement and extended the commercial operations deadline to September 30, 2022. In addition, in the July 7, 2022 amendment to the tax equity financing agreement, the terms of East West Banks remaining investment commitment of $12.0 million were modified such that East West Bank will contribute $4.0 million on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Groton Project achieving commercial operations, rather than contributing the full $12.0 million when the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. Such contributions are subject to certain customer conditions precedent, including a third-party certification by an independent engineer that the plant is operating in conformance with the amended and restated power purchase agreement. When such contributions are made by East West Bank, the funds will be distributed upstream to the Company, as a reimbursement of prior construction costs incurred by the Company. In conjunction with this amendment, the Company agreed to pay aggregate fees of $0.5 million (which are inclusive of the fees from the previous extensions described above), which were payable by the Company upon commencement of commercial operations of the plant.\nOn October 4, 2022, the Company and East West Bank further amended their tax equity financing agreement to extend the deadline by which commercial operations were to be achieved at the Groton Project from September 30, 2022 to November 30, 2022. In addition, modifications to the Groton Project documents between Connecticut Municipal Electric Energy Cooperative (CMEEC) and the Company as a result of the agreement between those parties to commence operations at less than 7.4 MW required the approval of East West Bank as part of East West Banks rights under the agreement between East West Bank and the Company. On December 16, 2022, the Company and CMEEC agreed that, for all purposes, the commercial operations date has occurred, and, accordingly, East West Bank no longer has a right to have its investment returned and this investment became a non-redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 16, 2022. In addition, on December 16, 2022, the Company paid the aggregate fees of $0.5 million described above to East West Bank. Refer to Note 20. Subsequent Events for additional details.\nUnder most partnership flip structures, tax equity investors agree to receive a minimum target rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis. Prior to receiving a contractual rate of return or a date specified in the contractual arrangements, East\nWest Bank will receive substantially all of the non-cash value attributable to the Groton Project, which includes accelerated depreciation and Section 48(a) investment tax credits; however, the Company will receive a majority of the cash distributions (based on the operating income of the Groton Project), which are paid quarterly. After East West Bank receives its contractual rate of return, the Company will receive approximately 95% of the cash and tax allocations. The Company (through a separate wholly owned entity) may enter into a back leverage debt financing transaction and use the cash distributions from the Groton Partnership to service the debt.\nYaphank Tax Equity Financing Transaction\nThe Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction in November 2021 with Renewable Energy Investors, LLC (REI), a subsidiary of Franklin Park Infrastructure, LLC, for the 7.4 MW fuel cell project (the LIPA Yaphank Project) located in Yaphank Long Island. REIs tax equity commitment totaled $12.4 million.\nThis transaction was structured as a partnership flip, which is a structure commonly used by tax equity investors in the financing of renewable energy projects. Under this partnership flip structure, a partnership, in this case YTBFC Holdco, LLC (the Yaphank Partnership), was organized to acquire from FuelCell Energy Finance II, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, all outstanding equity interests in Yaphank Fuel Cell Park, LLC, which in turn owns the LIPA Yaphank Project and is the party to the power purchase agreement and all project agreements. REI holds Class A Units in the Yaphank Partnership and a subsidiary of the Company holds the Class B Units. The initial funding occurred on December 13, 2021, upon the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent (including the receipt of an appraisal and confirmation that the LIPA Yaphank Project would be eligible for the investment tax credit (ITC) under Section 48 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended). In connection with the initial closing, the Company was able to draw down approximately $3.2 million, of which approximately $0.4 million was used to pay closing costs, including title insurance expenses and legal and consulting fees. The Company drew down the remaining amount of the commitment, approximately $9.2 million, in December 2021 and January 2022, after the LIPA Yaphank Project achieved commercial operation. These proceeds were partially offset by legal and advisory fees of approximately $0.4 million.\nThe Company determined during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 that there was an overpayment by REI of the Class A Member Capital Contribution of $0.5 million and as such the Company refunded this amount back to REI, reducing the REI tax equity commitment to $11.9 million. During the year ended October 31, 2022, the Company made priority return distributions to REI of $0.3 million, which was calculated at a 2.73% annual interest rate on invested tax equity capital.\nUnder a partnership flip structure, tax equity investors agree to receive a minimum target rate of return, typically on an after-tax basis. Prior to receiving a contractual rate of return or a date specified in the contractual arrangements, REI will receive substantially all of the non-cash value attributable to the LIPA Yaphank Project, which includes accelerated depreciation and Section 48(a) investment tax credits; however, the Company will receive a majority of the cash distributions (based on the operating income of the LIPA Yaphank Project), which are paid quarterly. After REI receives its contractual rate of return, the Company will receive approximately 95% of the cash and tax allocations. The Company may enter into a back leverage debt financing transaction and use the cash distributions from the Yaphank Partnership to service the debt.\nUnder this partnership flip structure, after the fifth anniversary following achievement of commercial operations, we have an option to acquire all of the equity interests that REI holds in the Yaphank Partnership starting after REI receives its contractual rate of return (the anticipated flip date) after the LIPA Yaphank Project is operational. If we exercise this option, we will be required to pay the greater of the following: (i) the fair market value of REI's equity interest at the time the option is exercised or (ii) an amount equal to 10.3% of REIs capital contributions. This option payment is to be grossed up for federal taxes if it exceeds the tax basis of the Yaphank Partnership Class A Units.\nNote 4. Inventories\nInventories (short and long-term) as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nRaw materials\n$\n30,624\n$\n25,968\nWork-in-process (1)\n67,834\n45,692\nInventories\n98,458\n71,660\nInventories - current\n(90,909)\n(67,074)\nInventories - long-term (2)\n$\n7,549\n$\n4,586\n(1) Work-in-process includes the standard components of inventory used to build the typical modules or module components that are intended to be used in future project asset construction or power platform orders or for use under the Companys service agreements. Included in work-in-process as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $54.0 million and $39.7 million, respectively, of completed standard components and modules.\n(2) Long-term inventory includes modules that are contractually required to be segregated for use as replacement modules for a specific project asset.\nRaw materials consist mainly of various nickel powders and steels, various other components used in producing cell stacks and purchased components for BOP. Work-in-process inventory is comprised of material, labor, and overhead costs incurred to build fuel cell stacks and modules, which are subcomponents of a power platform.\nNote 5. Project Assets\nProject assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nProject Assets - Operating\n$\n154,736\n$\n116,286\n4-20 years\nAccumulated depreciation\n(29,546)\n(19,844)\nProject Assets - Operating, net\n125,190\n96,442\nProject Assets - Construction in progress\n107,696\n126,835\n7-20 years\nProject Assets, net\n$\n232,886\n$\n223,277\nThe estimated useful lives of these project assets are 20 years for BOP and site construction, and four to seven years for modules. Project assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 included eight completed, commissioned installations generating power with respect to which the Company has a PPA with the end-user of power and site host with a net aggregate value of $125.2 million and $96.4 million as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Certain of these assets are the subject of sale-leaseback arrangements with PNC and Crestmark.\nProject assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 also include installations with carrying values of $107.7 million and $126.8 million, respectively, which are being developed and constructed by the Company in connection with projects for which we have entered into PPAs or projects for which we expect to secure PPAs or otherwise recover the asset value and which have not yet been placed in service.\nFiscal Year 2022 Charges, Including Impairment Charges\nIncluded in Construction in progress is the 2.3 MW Toyota project. It was determined in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that a potential source of renewable natural gas (RNG) at favorable pricing was no longer sufficiently probable and that market pricing for RNG had significantly increased, resulting in the determination that the carrying value of the project asset was no longer recoverable. Refer to Note 18. Commitments and Contingencies for more information regarding fuel risk exposure. Charges for the year ended October 31, 2022 were $22.1 million, which represents the carrying value of the project asset less the carrying value of inventory components that could be redeployed for alternative use. As this project is being constructed, only inventory components that can be redeployed for alternative use are being capitalized. The balance of costs incurred are being expensed as generation cost of revenues.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company made the decision not to proceed with development of the 7.4 MW and 1.0 MW Hartford projects given the then current economic profile of these projects. As a result, the Company recorded a $0.8 million impairment charge. The Company intends to seek modifications to the PPAs relating to these projects, however, there can be no assurance that such modifications will be acceptable to the counterparties (Eversource and United Illuminating) or approved by Connecticut regulators.\nFiscal Year 2021 Impairment Charges\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded project asset impairment charges for (i) the Triangle Street Project, (ii) the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects, and (iii) the Toyota Project, which are further described as follows:\ni. Impairment charge for the Triangle Street Project: In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, based upon the carrying value of the components that can be removed and utilized to service similar project assets and due to the uncertainty as to whether the project asset will generate further cash flows, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $0.4 million. The remaining carrying value was $5.6 million as of October 31, 2021.\nii. Impairment charge for the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects: As previously reported, in July 2017, the Company was awarded three projects on Long Island, New York totaling 39.8 MW by the Long Island Power Authority (LIPA). In December 2018, the Company executed a power purchase agreement for one of the three awards (a 7.4 MW project in Yaphank, Long Island). The other two awards, for which there are no executed power purchase agreements (and which are referred to herein as the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects), had been progressing through the required interconnect process while the Company worked to find a commercial resolution and enter into such agreements with LIPA. Given the passage of time without a resolution, the Company made a decision to no longer pursue the interconnection process and will no longer pursue development of the LIPA Brookhaven and Clare Rose Projects. As a result of this decision, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a charge of $1.8 million to impair the carrying value of the development costs for these two projects.\niii. Impairment charge for the Toyota Project: A $2.8 million charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, which represents the carrying value of the project asset less the carrying value of inventory components that could be redeployed for alternative use.\nFiscal Year 2020 Impairment Charges\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, the Company reviewed the Triangle Street Project and, as a result of output and revenue projections given then-current development plans, recorded an additional impairment charge of $2.4 million. The Triangle Street Project is used by the Company as a development platform for the Companys advanced applications. Because we use the platform for development activities, generation revenue has been negatively impacted.\nImpairment charges are recorded as cost of generation revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nDepreciation expense for project assets was $14.2 million, $13.7 million and $12.9 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nProject construction costs incurred for long-term project assets are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The proceeds received from the sale and subsequent leaseback of project assets are classified as Cash flows from financing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are classified as a finance obligation within Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (refer to Note 10. Debt for more information).\nNote 6. Property, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nEstimated\nUseful Life\nLand\n$\n$\n-\nBuilding and improvements\n21,216\n20,865\n10-26 years\nMachinery, equipment and software\n108,656\n109,449\n3-8 years\nFurniture and fixtures\n4,354\n4,325\n10 years\nConstruction in progress\n26,484\n6,424\n-\n161,234\n141,587\nAccumulated depreciation\n(103,097)\n(102,171)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n58,137\n$\n39,416\nThe Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $1.0 million during the year ended October 31, 2022 (related to the cessation of operations at a conditioning facility in Danbury, CT, which is being replaced by a new conditioning facility located at our Torrington, CT manufacturing facility as a part of our fiscal year 2022 and 2023 capital investments). There were no impairments of property, plant and equipment for the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDepreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $5.8 million, $4.9 million and $5.1 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had goodwill of $4.1 million and intangible assets of $17.4 million and $18.7 million, respectively, that were recorded in connection with the Companys 2012 acquisition of Versa Power Systems Inc. (Versa) and the 2019 Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project acquisition.\nThe Versa acquisition intangible asset represents indefinite-lived IPR&D for cumulative research and development efforts associated with the development of solid oxide fuel cell stationary power generation. The Company completed its annual impairment analysis of goodwill and IPR&D assets as of July 31, 2022. The Company performed a qualitative analysis for fiscal year 2022 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset. Additionally, there were no impairments of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset during fiscal year 2021 and 2020.\nAmortization expense for the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project-related intangible asset was $1.3 million for each of the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe following tables summarize the Companys intangible assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nAs of October 31, 2022\nGross Amount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Amount\nIn-Process Research and Development\n$\n9,592\n$\n-\n$\n9,592\nBridgeport PPA\n12,320\n(4,539)\n7,781\nTotal\n$\n21,912\n$\n(4,539)\n$\n17,373\nAs of October 31, 2021\nGross Amount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet Amount\nIn-Process Research and Development\n$\n9,592\n$\n-\n$\n9,592\nBridgeport PPA\n12,320\n(3,242)\n9,078\nTotal\n$\n21,912\n$\n(3,242)\n$\n18,670\nAmortization expense is recorded on a straight-line basis and future amortization expense will be $1.3 million per year until the Bridgeport PPA is fully amortized.\nNote 8. Accrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nAccrued payroll and employee benefits (1)\n$\n8,534\n$\n2,544\nAccrued product warranty cost (2)\nAccrued service agreement and PPA costs (3)\n11,340\n9,112\nAccrued legal, taxes, professional and other\n7,004\n4,371\nAccrued liabilities\n$\n27,415\n$\n16,099\n(1) The balance in this account represents accrued payroll, payroll taxes and accrued bonus for both periods. The increase in the account relates to an increase in accrued bonus as of October 31, 2022.\n(2) The increase in accrued product warranty cost reflects the costs associated with the warranties provided under the Settlement Agreement with POSCO Energy and KFC. Product warranty expense for the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.5 million and $0.03 million, respectively.\n(3) Accrued service agreement costs include loss accruals on service contracts of $7.3 million as of October 31, 2022, which increased from $6.5 million as of October 31, 2021. The increase is the result of a change in estimates regarding timing of future module exchanges and future module replacement costs. The accruals for performance guarantees on service agreements and PPAs increased from $2.5 million as of October 31, 2021 to $4.1 million as of October 31, 2022.\nNote 9. Leases\nThe Company enters into operating and finance lease agreements for the use of real estate, vehicles, information technology equipment, and certain other equipment. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The impacts of accounting for operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Operating lease liabilities, and Long-term operating lease liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are not considered significant to the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets or Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. Finance lease right-of-use (ROU) assets of $0.1 million at each of October 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Property, plant and equipment, net in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance lease liabilities of $0.1 million at each of October 31, 2022 and 2021 are included in Current portion of long-term debt and Long-term debt and other liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOperating lease expense for each of the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $1.5 million. As of October 31, 2022, the weighted average remaining lease term (in years) was approximately 19 years and the weighted average discount rate was 8.2%. Lease payments made during the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 totaled $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million, respectively.\nAs of October 31, 2022, undiscounted maturities of operating lease and finance lease liabilities are as follows (in thousands):\nOperating\nLeases\nFinance\nLeases\nDue Year 1\n$\n1,122\n$\nDue Year 2\nDue Year 3\n-\nDue Year 4\n-\nDue Year 5\n-\nThereafter\n13,474\n-\nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n17,806\nLess imputed interest\n(9,581)\n(8)\nTotal discounted lease payments\n$\n8,225\n$\nSan Bernardino Fuel Cell, LLC Sale-Leaseback Transaction\nOn August 25, 2021, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, San Bernardino Fuel Cell, LLC (SBFC), entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the San Bernardino Purchase Agreement) and an Equipment Lease Agreement (the San Bernardino Lease) with Crestmark Equipment Finance (Crestmark). Under these agreements, SBFC sold the 1.4 MW biogas fueled fuel cell power plant (the San Bernardino Plant) located at the San Bernardino wastewater treatment plant in San Bernardino, California to Crestmark for a purchase price of $10.2 million and then leased the San Bernardino Plant back from Crestmark. SBFC sells the power produced by the San Bernardino Plant to a third party under a twenty-year PPA (the San Bernardino PPA).\nThe San Bernardino Lease has an initial term of ten years but may be extended at the option of SBFC. An initial rental down payment and one quarters rent totaling $2.2 million was paid using the proceeds from the sale of the San Bernardino Plant. Lease payments are expected to be funded with proceeds from the sale of power under the San Bernardino PPA on a quarterly basis. As a result of the sale-leaseback transaction, the remaining lease payments due over the term of the San Bernardino Lease were approximately $4.5 million as of October 31, 2022.\nReserves covering debt service and future module replacement totaling $2.5 million were also deducted from the proceeds from the sale of the San Bernardino Plant and will be classified as restricted cash of the Company until such time as it meets its performance obligations (such as servicing the San Bernardino Plant and providing module exchanges) under the Long-Term Service Agreement for the San Bernardino Plant. The Companys net unrestricted cash proceeds from the transaction totaled approximately $5.3 million, which is the purchase price less the initial rent payments, debt and module reserves, and taxes and transaction fees.\nIn addition, SBFC and Crestmark entered into an Assignment Agreement on August 25, 2021 (the San Bernardino Assignment Agreement) and FuelCell Finance (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the direct parent of SBFC) and Crestmark entered into a Pledge Agreement on August 25, 2021 (the San Bernardino Pledge Agreement) pursuant to which agreements collateral was provided to Crestmark to secure SBFCs obligations under the San Bernardino Lease which includes a security interest in (i) certain agreements relating to the sale-leaseback transaction, (ii) the revenues with respect to the San Bernardino Plant, (iii) a cash module replacement reserve for the San Bernardino Plant, and (iv) FuelCell Finances equity interest in SBFC. SBFC and the Company also entered into a Technology License and Access Agreement with Crestmark on August 25, 2021, which provides Crestmark with certain intellectual property license rights to have access to the Companys proprietary fuel cell technology, but only for the purpose of maintaining and servicing the San Bernardino Plant in certain circumstances in which the Company is not satisfying its obligations under its service agreement with regard to the maintenance and servicing of the San Bernardino Plant.\nPursuant to the San Bernardino Lease, SBFC has an obligation to indemnify Crestmark for the amount of any actual reduction in the U.S. investment tax credit (ITC) anticipated to be realized by Crestmark in connection with this sale-leaseback transaction. Such obligation would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying fuel cell project as assessed by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Company does not believe that any such obligation is probable based on the facts known as of October 31, 2022. The maximum potential future payments that SBFC could be required to make as a result of this obligation would depend on the difference between the fair value of the fuel cell project sold or financed and the value the IRS would determine as the fair value of the project for purposes of claiming the ITC. The value of the ITC in the sale-leaseback agreements is based on guidelines provided by regulations from the IRS. The Company and Crestmark used a fair value determined with the assistance of an independent third-party appraisal.\nThe San Bernardino Purchase Agreement and the San Bernardino Lease contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, and events of default that entitle Crestmark to cause SBFCs indebtedness under the San Bernardino Lease to become immediately due and payable.\nPursuant to a Guaranty Agreement executed on August 25, 2021 by the Company for the benefit of Crestmark (the San Bernardino Guaranty), the Company has guaranteed the payment and performance of SBFCs obligations under the San Bernardino Lease.\nNote 10. Debt\nDebt as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nConnecticut Green Bank Loan\n$\n4,800\n$\n4,800\nConnecticut Green Bank Loan (Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project)\n3,507\n4,318\nLiberty Bank Term Loan Agreement (Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project)\n5,382\n7,465\nFifth Third Bank Term Loan Agreement (Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project)\n5,382\n7,465\nFinance obligation for sale-leaseback transactions\n56,625\n56,492\nState of Connecticut Loan\n7,774\n8,622\nFinance lease obligations\nDeferred finance costs\n(1,152)\n(1,556)\nTotal debt and finance obligations\n82,375\n87,708\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance obligations\n(13,198)\n(10,085)\nLong-term debt and finance obligations\n$\n69,177\n$\n77,623\nAggregate annual principal payments under our loan agreements, finance obligation, and finance lease obligations for the years subsequent to October 31, 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nYear 1\n$\n13,526\nYear 2\n10,348\nYear 3\n8,678\nYear 4\n5,432\nYear 5\n2,990\nThereafter (1)\n4,044\n$\n45,018\n(1) The annual principal payments included above only include sale-leaseback payments whereas the difference between debt outstanding as of October 31, 2022 and the annual principal payments represent accreted interest and amounts included in the finance obligation that exceed required principal payments.\nOrion Energy Partners Investment Agent, LLC Credit Agreement\nOn October 31, 2019, the Company and certain of its affiliates as guarantors entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended, the Orion Credit Agreement) with Orion Energy Partners Investment Agent, LLC, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent (the Orion Agent), and certain lenders affiliated with the Orion Agent for a $200.0 million senior secured credit facility (the Orion Facility), structured as a delayed draw term loan to be provided by the lenders primarily to fund certain of the Companys construction and related costs for fuel cell projects meeting the requirements of the Orion Facility. Under the Orion Credit Agreement, each lender funded its commitments less 2.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the loans funded by such lender (the Loan Discount).\nOn October 31, 2019, the Company drew down $14.5 million (the Initial Funding) and received $14.1 million, after taking into account a Loan Discount of $0.4 million. On October 31, 2019, in connection with the Initial Funding, the Company issued warrants to the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement to purchase up to a total of 6.0 million shares of the Companys common stock, at an exercise price of $0.310 per share (the Initial Funding Warrants).\nOn November 22, 2019, a second draw (the Second Funding) of $65.5 million, funded by Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II, L.P., Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II GPFA, L.P., Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II PV, L.P., and Orion Energy Credit Opportunities FuelCell Co-Invest, L.P. (as the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement), was made to fully repay certain outstanding third party debt of the Company and to fund construction costs and capital expenditures relating to certain projects. The Company received $63.9 million in the Second Funding after taking into account a Loan Discount of $1.6 million as described above. Also in conjunction with the Second Funding, the Company issued to the lenders warrants to purchase up to a total of 14.0 million shares of the Companys common stock, with an initial exercise price with respect to 8.0 million of such shares of $0.242 per share and with an initial exercise price with respect to 6.0 million of such shares of $0.620 per share (the Second Funding Warrants).\nThe issuance of the Initial Funding Warrants and recognition of the Second Funding Warrants resulted in $3.9 million being recorded as a liability as of October 31, 2019 with the offset recorded as a debt discount. Refer to Note 11. Stockholders Equity and Warrant Liabilities for additional information regarding the Initial Funding Warrants and Second Funding Warrants, including the accounting, terms and conversions during the years ended October 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOn November 30, 2020, the Company, its subsidiary guarantors, and the Orion Agent entered into a payoff letter with respect to the Orion Credit Agreement (the Orion Payoff Letter). Pursuant to the Orion Payoff Letter, on December 7, 2020, the Company paid a total of $87.3 million to the Orion Agent, representing the outstanding principal, accrued but unpaid interest, prepayment premium, fees, costs and other expenses due and owing under the Orion Facility and the Orion Credit Agreement and related loan documents, in full repayment of the Companys outstanding indebtedness under the Orion Facility and the Orion Credit Agreement and related loan documents. In accordance with the Orion Payoff Letter, the aggregate prepayment premium set forth in the Orion Credit Agreement was reduced from approximately $14.9 million to $4.0 million and the Orion Agent, on behalf of itself and the lenders, agreed that any portion of the prepayment premium that would otherwise be required to be paid pursuant to the Orion Credit Agreement in excess of $4.0 million was waived by the Orion Agent and the lenders. The Company expensed the remaining deferred finance costs and debt discount of $7.1 million. The Company has classified the $4.0 million prepayment premium and the deferred finance costs and debt discount expense as Loss on extinguishment of debt and finance obligations on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nConcurrently with the Orion Agents receipt of full payment pursuant to the Orion Payoff Letter, the Orion Agent released all of the collateral from the liens granted under the security documents associated with the Orion Facility (which included the release of $11.2 million of restricted cash to the Company, which became unrestricted cash), and the Company and its subsidiaries were unconditionally released from their respective obligations under the Orion Credit Agreement (and related loan documents) and the Orion Facility without further action. With the termination of the Orion Facility and the Orion Credit Agreement and related loan documents, the lenders no longer have the right to appoint representatives to attend the Companys Board of Director meetings as observers.\nConnecticut Green Bank Loans\nAs of October 31, 2019, the Company had a long-term loan agreement with the Connecticut Green Bank, providing the Company with a loan of $1.8 million (the Green Bank Loan Agreement). On and effective as of December 19, 2019, the Company and Connecticut Green Bank entered into an amendment to the Green Bank Loan Agreement (the Green Bank Amendment). Upon the execution of the Green Bank Amendment on December 19, 2019, Connecticut Green Bank made an additional loan to the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 million (the December 2019 Loan), which was to be used (i) first, to pay closing fees related to the May 9, 2019 acquisition of the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project and the Subordinated Credit Agreement (as defined below), other fees and interest, and (ii) thereafter, for general corporate purposes.\nThe Green Bank Amendment provides that, until such time as the loan (which includes both the outstanding principal balance of the original loan under the Green Bank Loan Agreement and the outstanding principal amount of the December 2019 Loan) has been repaid in its entirety, interest on the outstanding balance of the loan shall accrue at a rate of 8% per annum, payable by the Company on a monthly basis in arrears. Interest payments made by the Company after the date of the Green Bank Amendment are to be applied first to interest that has accrued on the outstanding principal balance of the original loan under the Green Bank Loan Agreement and then to interest that has accrued on the December 2019 Loan.\nThe Green Bank Amendment also modifies the repayment and mandatory prepayment terms and extends the maturity date set forth in the original Green Bank Loan Agreement. Under the Green Bank Amendment, to the extent that excess cash flow reserve funds under the BFC Credit Agreement (as defined below) are eligible for disbursement to Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC pursuant to Section 6.23(c) of the BFC Credit Agreement, such funds are to be paid to Connecticut Green Bank until the loans are repaid in full. The Green Bank Amendment further provides that any unpaid balance of the loan and all other obligations due under the Green Bank Loan Agreement will be due and payable on May 9, 2026. Finally, with respect to mandatory prepayments, the Green Bank Amendment provides that, when the Company has closed on the subordinated project term loan pursuant to the Commitment Letter, dated February 6, 2019, issued by Connecticut Green Bank to Groton Station Fuel Cell, LLC (Groton Fuel Cell) to provide a subordinated project term loan to Groton Fuel Cell in the amount of $5.0 million, the Company will be required to prepay to Connecticut Green Bank the lesser of any then outstanding\namount of the December 2019 Loan and the amount of the subordinated project term loan actually advanced by Connecticut Green Bank. The balance under the original Green Bank Loan Agreement and the December 2019 Loan as of October 31, 2022 was $4.8 million.\nBridgeport Fuel Cell Project Loans\nOn May 9, 2019, in connection with the closing of the purchase of the membership interests of Bridgeport Fuel Cell, LLC (BFC) (and the 14.9 MW Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project), BFC (a subsidiary of the Company following the closing) entered into a subordinated credit agreement with the Connecticut Green Bank whereby Connecticut Green Bank provided financing in the amount of $6.0 million (the Subordinated Credit Agreement). This $6.0 million consisted of $1.8 million in incremental funding that was received by BFC and $4.2 million of funding previously received by FuelCell Energy, Inc. with respect to which BFC became the primary obligor. As security for the Subordinated Credit Agreement, Connecticut Green Bank received a perfected lien, subordinated and second in priority to the liens securing the $25.0 million loaned under the BFC Credit Agreement (as defined below), in all of the same collateral securing the BFC Credit Agreement. The interest rate under the Subordinated Credit Agreement is 8% per annum. Principal and interest are due monthly in amounts sufficient to fully amortize the loan over an 84-month period ending in May 2026. The Subordinated Credit Agreement contains a debt coverage ratio which is required to be maintained and may not be less than 1.10 as of the end of each fiscal quarter, beginning with the quarter ended July 31, 2020. The balance under the Subordinated Credit Agreement as of October 31, 2022 was $3.5 million.\nOn May 9, 2019, in connection with the closing of the purchase of the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project, BFC entered into a Credit Agreement with Liberty Bank, as administrative agent and co-lead arranger, and Fifth Third Bank as co-lead arranger and interest rate swap hedger (the BFC Credit Agreement), whereby (i) Fifth Third Bank provided financing in the amount of $12.5 million towards the purchase price for the BFC acquisition; and (ii) Liberty Bank provided financing in the amount of $12.5 million towards the purchase price for the BFC acquisition. As security for the BFC Credit Agreement, Liberty Bank and Fifth Third Bank were granted a first priority lien in (i) all assets of BFC, including BFCs cash accounts, fuel cells, and all other personal property, as well as third party contracts including the Energy Purchase Agreement between BFC and Connecticut Light and Power Company dated July 10, 2009, as amended; (ii) certain fuel cell modules that are intended to be used to replace the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Projects fuel cell modules as part of routine operation and maintenance; and (iii) FuelCell Energy Finance, LLCs (a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and the direct parent of BFC) ownership interest in BFC. The maturity date under the BFC Credit Agreement is May 9, 2025. Monthly principal and interest are to be paid in arrears in an amount sufficient to fully amortize the term loan over a 72-month period. BFC has the right to make additional principal payments or pay the balance due under the BFC Credit Agreement in full, provided that it pays any associated breakage fees with regard to the interest rate swap agreements fixing the interest rate. The interest rate under the BFC Credit Agreement fluctuates monthly at the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 275 basis points.\nAn interest rate swap agreement was required to be entered into with Fifth Third Bank in connection with the BFC Credit Agreement to protect against movements in the floating LIBOR index. Accordingly, on May 16, 2019, an interest rate swap agreement (the Swap Agreement) was entered into with Fifth Third Bank in connection with the BFC Credit Agreement for the term of the loan. The net interest rate across the BFC Credit Agreement and the swap transaction results in a fixed rate of 5.09%. The interest rate swap is adjusted to fair value on a quarterly basis. The estimated fair value is based on Level 2 inputs including primarily the forward LIBOR curve available to swap dealers. The valuation methodology involves comparison of (i) the sum of the present value of all monthly variable rate payments based on a reset rate using the forward LIBOR curve and (ii) the sum of the present value of all monthly fixed rate payments on the notional amount, which is equivalent to the outstanding principal amount of the loans. The fair value adjustments for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 resulted in a $0.8 million gain, a $0.5 million gain and a $0.3 million loss, respectively. The fair value of the interest rate swap asset (liability) as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $0.3 million and $(0.5) million, respectively. On August 1, 2022, the Company entered into an amendment to its interest rate swap agreement that replaced LIBOR with Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) effective as of June 2023.\nThe BFC Credit Agreement requires BFC to maintain a debt service reserve. Each of Liberty Bank and Fifth Third Bank also has an operation and module replacement reserve (O&M Reserve) under the BFC Credit Agreement. BFC is required to deposit $0.1 million per month into each O&M Reserve for the first five years of the BFC Credit Agreement, with such funds to be released at the sole discretion of Liberty Bank and Fifth Third Bank, as applicable. BFC is also required to maintain excess cash flow reserve accounts at each of Liberty Bank and Fifth Third Bank. Excess cash flow consists of cash generated by BFC from the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Project after payment of all expenses (including after\npayment of intercompany service fees to the Company), debt service to Liberty Bank and Fifth Third Bank, the funding of all required reserves, and payments to Connecticut Green Bank for the subordinated facility. BFC is also required to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.20, measured for the trailing year based on fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ended July 31, 2020. The Company was in compliance with the debt service coverage ratio as of October 31, 2022. The Company has certain quarterly and annual financial reporting requirements under the BFC Credit Agreement. The annual financial statements to be provided pursuant to such requirements are to be audited and accompanied by a report of an independent certified public accountant, which report shall not include a going concern matter of emphasis or any qualification as to the scope of such audit.\nFinance obligations for sale leaseback agreements\nSeveral of the Companys project subsidiaries previously entered into sale-leaseback agreements with PNC for commissioned projects where the Company had entered into a PPA with the site host/end-user of produced power, and CCFC2 and SBFC entered into sale-leaseback transactions with Crestmark on February 11, 2020 and August 25, 2021, respectively (refer to Note. 9. Leases for additional information). The Company did not recognize as revenue any of the proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitute payments to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements. Instead, the sale proceeds received were accounted for as finance obligations. The outstanding finance obligation balance as of October 31, 2022 was $56.6 million as compared to $56.5 million as of October 31, 2021. The outstanding finance obligation for the remaining leases includes $38.6 million in excess of future required payments which represents imputed interest, not including amounts for the potential repurchase price of the project assets which is based on fair value. The sale-leaseback arrangements with PNC allow the Company to repurchase the project assets at fair market value and the sale-leaseback arrangements with Crestmark include a purchase right for the greater of fair market value or 31% of the purchase price.\nState of Connecticut Loan\nIn October 2015, the Company closed on a definitive Assistance Agreement with the State of Connecticut (the Assistance Agreement) and received a disbursement of $10.0 million, which was used for the first phase of the expansion of the Companys Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility. In conjunction with this financing, the Company entered into a $10.0 million promissory note and related security agreements securing the loan with equipment liens and a mortgage on its Danbury, Connecticut location. Interest accrues at a fixed interest rate of 2.0%, and the loan is repayable over 15 years from the date of the first advance, which occurred in October of 2015. Principal payments were deferred for four years from disbursement and began on December 1, 2019. Under the Assistance Agreement, the Company was eligible for up to $5.0 million in loan forgiveness if the Company created 165 full-time positions and retained 538 full-time positions for two consecutive years (the Employment Obligation) as measured on October 28, 2017 (the Target Date). The Assistance Agreement was subsequently amended in April 2017 to extend the Target Date by two years to October 28, 2019.\nIn January 2019, the Company and the State of Connecticut entered into a Second Amendment to the Assistance Agreement (the Second Amendment). The Second Amendment extended the Target Date to October 31, 2022 and amended the Employment Obligation to require the Company to continuously maintain a minimum of 538 full-time positions for 24 consecutive months. If the Company met the Employment Obligation, as modified by the Second Amendment, and created an additional 91 full-time positions, the Company would have received a credit in the amount of $2.0 million to be applied against the outstanding balance of the loan. However, based on the Companys headcount as of October 31, 2022, it did not meet this requirement and will not receive this credit. A job audit will be performed within 90 days of the Target Date. Because the Company did not meet the Employment Obligation, an accelerated payment penalty will be assessed at a rate of $18,587.36 multiplied by the number of employees below the number of employees required by the Employment Obligation. Such penalty is immediately payable and will be applied first to accelerate the payment of any outstanding fees or interest due and then to accelerate the payment of outstanding principal. The Company did not meet the Employment Obligation as of October 31, 2022 and estimates that it had an average of 359 employees over the 24 consecutive month period. As a result, $3.3 million of the loan has been reclassified to current, which represents the accelerated payment penalty amount. The Company has not been formally assessed a penalty but since there are no fees or interest due, any penalty assessed would be applied to the outstanding principal and not result in any charges to the Statement of Operations.\nIn April of 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the State of Connecticut agreed to defer three months of principal and interest payments under the Assistance Agreement, beginning with the May 2020 payment. These deferred payments will be added at the end of the loan, thus extending out the maturity date by three months.\nDeferred Finance Costs\nAs of October 31, 2022, deferred finance costs relate primarily to sale-leaseback transactions entered into with PNC and Crestmark, which are being amortized over the 10-year terms of the lease agreements and payments under the loans obtained to purchase the membership interests in BFC, which are being amortized over the 8-year term of the loans.\nNote 11. Stockholders Equity and Warrant Liabilities\nIncrease in Authorized Shares\nThe Company obtained stockholder approval on April 8, 2021 at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders to increase the number of shares of common stock the Company is authorized to issue under the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. The Companys stockholders approved a 162.5 million increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, on April 8, 2021, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Delaware Secretary of State increasing the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 337.5 million shares to 500.0 million shares.\nThe Company obtained stockholder approval on May 8, 2020 at the reconvened 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue under our Certificate of Incorporation, as amended. Our stockholders approved a 112.5 million increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock. Accordingly, on May 11, 2020, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company with the Delaware Secretary of State increasing the total number of authorized shares of common stock from 225.0 million shares to 337.5 million shares.\nOpen Market Sale Agreements and At Market Issuance Sales Agreement\n2022 Open Market Sale Agreement\nOn July 12, 2022, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC, B. Riley Securities, Inc., Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BofA Securities, Inc., Canaccord Genuity LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Loop Capital Markets LLC (the Open Market Sale Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company may, from time to time, offer and sell up to 95.0 million shares of the Companys common stock. Pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement, the Company pays each agent a commission equal to 2.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale of shares made by such agent under the Open Market Sale Agreement. From the date of the Open Market Sale Agreement through October 31, 2022, the Company sold approximately 18.5 million shares under the Open Market Sale Agreement at an average sale price of $3.63 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $67.2 million, before deducting sales commissions and fees, and net proceeds to the Company of approximately $65.4 million after deducting commissions and fees totaling approximately $1.8 million.\nWhile there were no sales under the Open Market Sale Agreement during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, there were sales made during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 that were not settled until the fourth quarter (which are included in the aggregate figures in the paragraph above). More specifically, 10.7 million shares were settled in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in gross proceeds (before deducting sales commissions) of approximately $39.2 million and net proceeds to the Company (received in August 2022) of approximately $38.4 million after deducting commissions totaling approximately $0.8 million. These share and dollar amounts are included in the aggregate sale amounts set forth in the paragraph above.\nAs of October 31, 2022, approximately 76.5 million shares were available for issuance under the Open Market Sale Agreement.\n2021 Open Market Sale Agreement\nOn June 11, 2021, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. (the 2021 Sales Agreement) with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company could,\nfrom time to time, offer and sell shares of the Companys common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $500 million. Pursuant to the 2021 Sales Agreement, the Company paid the agent making each sale a commission equal to 2.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds it received from such sale by such agent of shares under the 2021 Sales Agreement. From the date of the 2021 Sales Agreement through April 30, 2022, approximately 64.0 million shares of the Companys common stock were sold under the 2021 Sales Agreement at an average sales price of $7.79 per share, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $498.1 million, before deducting sales commissions. Commissions of approximately $10.0 million in the aggregate were paid to Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. in connection with these sales, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to the Company of approximately $488.1 million. Of these sales, approximately 19.9 million shares were sold under the 2021 Sales Agreement during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 at an average sales price of $6.07 per share, resulting in gross proceeds during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 of $120.8 million, before deducting expenses and sales commissions, and net proceeds to the Company during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 of approximately $118.3 million after deducting commissions and offering expenses totaling approximately $2.4 million.\nNo sales of common stock were made under the 2021 Sales Agreement after April 30, 2022, and no additional sales of common stock can or will be made under the 2021 Sales Agreement, as the Company, Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc. mutually agreed to terminate the 2021 Sales Agreement as of July 12, 2022.\n2020 Open Market Sale Agreement\nOn June 16, 2020, the Company entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the 2020 Sales Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (Jefferies), with respect to an at the market offering program under which the Company could offer and sell up to $75 million of shares of its common stock from time to time. Pursuant to the 2020 Sales Agreement, the Company paid Jefferies a commission equal to 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds it received from each sale of shares under the 2020 Sales Agreement. From the date of the 2020 Sales Agreement through October 31, 2020, 28.3 million shares were sold under the 2020 Sales Agreement at an average sales price of $2.55 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $72.3 million, before deducting expenses and sales commissions.

No sales of common stock have been made under the 2020 Sales Agreement since October 31, 2020, and, as the parties mutually agreed to terminate the 2020 Sales Agreement as of June 11, 2021, no additional sales of common stock will be made under the 2020 Sales Agreement in the future.\n2019 At Market Issuance Sales Agreement\nOn October 4, 2019, the Company entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the 2019 Sales Agreement) with B. Riley FBR, Inc. (B. Riley FBR) to create an at-the-market equity program under which the Company could offer and sell up to 38.0 million shares of its common stock through B. Riley FBR. However, to ensure that the Company had sufficient shares available for reservation and issuance upon exercise of all of the warrants to be issued to the lenders under the Orion Facility (as discussed in further detail below), the Company, effective as of October 31, 2019, reduced the number of shares reserved for future issuance and sale under the 2019 Sales Agreement from 27.9 million shares to 7.9 million shares (thus allowing for total aggregate issuances of up to 18.0 million shares under the 2019 Sales Agreement) and reserved 20.0 million shares for issuance upon exercise of the warrants by the lenders under the Orion Facility. Under the 2019 Sales Agreement, B. Riley FBR was entitled to a commission in an amount equal to 3.0% of the gross proceeds from each sale of shares under the 2019 Sales Agreement.\nDuring the year ended October 31, 2020, the Company issued and sold a total of 7.9 million shares of its common stock under the 2019 Sales Agreement at prevailing market prices, with an average sale price of $0.46 per share, and raised aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3.6 million, before deducting expenses and commissions. Commissions of $0.1 million were paid to B. Riley FBR in connection with these sales, resulting in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $3.5 million.\nThe Company terminated the 2019 Sales Agreement in June 2020. As a result of the termination of the 2019 Sales Agreement, there have been and will be no further sales of the Companys common stock thereunder.\nPublic Offerings and Outstanding Warrants\nDecember 2020 Common Stock Offering\nIn December of 2020, the Company and Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II, L.P., Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II GPFA, L.P., Orion Energy Credit Opportunities Fund II PV, L.P., and Orion Energy Credit Opportunities FuelCell Co-Invest, L.P. (the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement) (the Selling Stockholders) completed a public offering of the Companys common stock. In connection with this public offering, the Company and the Selling Stockholders entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which (i) the Company agreed to issue and sell to the underwriters 19,822,219 shares of the Companys common stock, plus up to 5,177,781 shares of common stock pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares, and (ii) the Selling Stockholders agreed to sell to the underwriters 14,696,320 shares of common stock, in each case at a price to the public of $6.50 per share. The underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares, resulting in the issuance and sale by the Company at the closing of the offering of a total of 25,000,000 shares of common stock. The offering closed on December 4, 2020.\nGross proceeds from the sale of common stock by the Company in the offering were $162.5 million. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock in the offering by the Selling Stockholders.\nThe Company and the Selling Stockholders paid underwriting discounts and commissions of $0.2275 per share, and net proceeds to the Company were approximately $156.4 million after deducting such underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses.\nSeptember 2020 Public Offering\nIn September 2020, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with respect to an offering of its common stock. The offering closed in October 2020, with the Companys sale of approximately 50.0 million shares of its common stock for gross and net proceeds of $105.1 million and $98.3 million, respectively.\nThe offering resulted in a Section 382 ownership change. Refer to Note 15. Income Taxes for more information regarding the impact of the Section 382 ownership change on net operating losses and carryforwards.\nMay 2017 Public Offering and Related Warrants\nOn May 3, 2017, the Company completed an underwritten public offering that included the offering and sale of Series C warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of its common stock.\nThe Series C warrants had an exercise price of $19.20 per share and a term of five years. During the year ended October 31, 2021, Series C warrants were exercised to purchase a total of 14,026 shares of the Companys common stock, resulting in cash proceeds to the Company of $0.3 million during fiscal year 2021. No Series C warrants were exercised during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. The Series C warrants contained provisions regarding adjustments to their exercise price and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise. No Series C warrants were exercised in fiscal year 2022 and they expired in May 2022.\nOrion Warrants\nIn connection with the closing of the Orion Credit Agreement and the Initial Funding, on October 31, 2019, the Company issued warrants to the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement to purchase up to a total of 6,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock, at an exercise price of $0.310 per share (the Initial Funding Warrants). In addition, under the Orion Credit Agreement, on the date of the Second Funding (November 22, 2019), the Company issued warrants to the lenders under the Orion Credit Agreement to purchase up to a total of 14,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock, with an exercise price with respect to 8,000,000 of such shares of $0.242 per share and with an exercise price with respect to 6,000,000 of such shares of $0.620 per share (the Second Funding Warrants, and together with the Initial Funding Warrants, the Orion Warrants).\nThe Company accounted for the Initial Funding Warrants as a liability since there was a change of control provision in the Initial Funding Warrants regarding the composition of the board of directors and, as such, the Company could have been required to repurchase the Initial Funding Warrants upon such change in control and therefore equity classification was precluded. The Company accounted for the Second Funding Warrants under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC\n815) since the Second Funding Warrants were considered contingent vesting warrants and therefore were considered to be an outstanding liability. Since the probability of vesting for the Second Funding Warrants was deemed to be 100% as there was no vesting period in the warrants, there was no impact on the valuation. The Second Funding Warrants were accounted for as a liability since the Company might have been required to pay the holder under the same change of control provision as the Initial Funding Warrants and such event was outside the Companys control and therefore equity classification was precluded.\nDuring the three months ended January 31, 2020, the lenders exercised, on a cashless basis, Orion Warrants representing the right to purchase 12,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock. Because these Orion Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis, the Company issued in the aggregate 9,396,320 shares of the Companys common stock. The Orion Warrants that were converted were remeasured to fair value immediately preceding the conversion based upon volatility of 103.7%, a risk free rate of 1.81% and the Companys common stock price of $2.29 on January 8, 2020, which resulted in a $23.7 million charge for the three months ended January 31, 2020. The revised estimated fair value of the converted Orion Warrants as of the date of conversion of $26.0 million was reclassified to Additional paid in capital. The remaining Orion Warrants as of January 31, 2020 were remeasured to estimated fair value based upon a volatility of 104.9%, a risk free rate of 1.45% and the Companys common stock price at January 31, 2020 of $1.59 per share, which resulted in a charge for the three months ended January 31, 2020 of $10.5 million. The Company remeasured the remaining Orion Warrants at October 31, 2020 based upon a volatility of 114.15%, a risk free rate of 0.64% and the Companys common stock price of $2.00 per share, which resulted in a charge of $0.2 million.\nOn December 7, 2020, all then remaining Orion Warrants were exercised to purchase a total of 2,700,000 shares of the Companys common stock for an aggregate exercise price of approximately $0.6 million (or $0.242 per share). The Orion Warrants that were converted on December 7, 2020 were remeasured to fair value immediately preceding the conversion based upon volatility of 117.02%, a risk free rate of 0.70% and the Companys common stock price of $7.95 on December 4, 2020, which resulted in a $16.0 million charge for the three months ended January 31, 2021. The estimated fair value of the converted Orion Warrants as of the December 7, 2020 date of conversion of $21.2 million was reclassified to Additional paid-in capital.\nOutstanding Warrants\nThe following table outlines the warrant activity during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021:\nSeries C\nOrion\nWarrants\nWarrants\nBalance as of October 31, 2020\n964,128\n2,700,000\nWarrants issued\n-\n-\nWarrants exchanged\n(14,026)\n(2,700,000)\nBalance as of October 31, 2021\n950,102\n-\nWarrants issued\n-\n-\nWarrants exercised\n-\n-\nWarrants expired\n(950,102)\n-\nBalance as of October 31, 2022\n-\n-\nNote 12. Redeemable Preferred Stock\nThe Company is authorized to issue up to 250,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, of which 105,875 shares were designated as 5% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock (referred to herein as Series B Preferred Stock) in March 2005. In addition, a subsidiary of the Company had authorized and issued preferred stock as of October 31, 2021, as described below.\nRedeemable Series B Preferred Stock\nThe Company has designated 105,875 shares of its authorized preferred stock as Series B Preferred Stock (liquidation preference $1,000.00 per share). As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 64,020 shares of Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, with a carrying value of $59.9 million. The following is a summary of certain terms of the Series B Preferred Stock.\nRanking. Shares of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock rank with respect to dividend rights and rights upon the Companys liquidation, winding up or dissolution:\n\u25cf senior to shares of the Companys common stock;\n\u25cf junior to the Companys debt obligations; and\n\u25cf effectively junior to the Companys subsidiaries (i) existing and future liabilities and (ii) capital stock held by others.\nDividends. The Series B Preferred Stock pays cumulative annual dividends of $50.00 per share, which are payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15, and November 15. Dividends accumulate and are cumulative from the date of original issuance. Unpaid accumulated dividends do not bear interest.\nThe dividend rate is subject to upward adjustment as set forth in the Amended Certificate of Designation for the Series B Preferred Stock (the Series B Certificate of Designation) if the Company fails to pay, or to set apart funds to pay, any quarterly dividend on the Series B Preferred Stock.\nNo dividends or other distributions may be paid or set apart for payment on the Companys common stock (other than a dividend payable solely in shares of a like or junior ranking), nor may any stock junior to or on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock be redeemed, purchased or otherwise acquired for any consideration (or any money paid to or made available for a sinking fund for such stock) by the Company or on its behalf\u2009 (except by conversion into or exchange for shares of a like or junior ranking), unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock have been paid or funds or shares of common stock have been set aside for payment of such accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nThe dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will be paid in cash, unless a registered holder elects (pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Series B Certificate of Designation) to receive such dividends in shares of the Companys common stock. Any such shares of common stock paid in lieu of cash dividends will be treated as restricted securities and will not be transferable by the recipient thereof except pursuant to an effective registration statement or pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). Dividends of $3.2 million were paid in cash during each of the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, and dividends of $4.8 million were paid in cash during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. Cumulative declared and unpaid dividends as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.8 million.\nNo dividends were declared or paid by the Company on the Series B Preferred Stock in connection with the May 15, 2019 and August 15, 2019 dividend payment dates. Based on the dividend rate in effect on May 15, 2019 and August 15, 2019, the aggregate amount of such dividend payments would have been $1.6 million. Because such dividends were not paid on May 15 or August 15, under the terms of the Series B Certificate of Designation, the holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock were entitled to receive, when, as and if, declared by the Board of Directors, dividends at a dividend rate per annum equal to the normal dividend rate of 5% plus an amount equal to the number of dividend periods for which the Company failed to pay or set apart funds to pay dividends multiplied by 0.0625%, for each subsequent dividend period until the Company paid or provided for the payment of all dividends on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock for all prior dividend periods. On October 30, 2019, dividends were declared by the Board of Directors with respect to the May 15, 2019 and August 15, 2019 dividend payment dates as well as the November 15, 2019 dividend payment date. A payment of $2.4 million made in the fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2020 represented the dividends payable with respect to the May 15, 2019 and August 15, 2019 dividend dates and the dividends payable with respect to the November 15, 2019 dividend date that were declared on October 30, 2019.\nLiquidation. The holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, in the event that the Company is liquidated, dissolved or wound up, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, $1,000.00 per share plus all accumulated and unpaid dividends up to but excluding the date of such liquidation, dissolution, or winding up (the Liquidation Preference). Until the holders of Series B Preferred Stock receive the Liquidation Preference with respect to their shares of Series B Preferred Stock in full, no payment will be made on any junior shares, including shares of the Companys common stock. After the Liquidation Preference is paid in full, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to receive any further distribution of the Companys assets. (For the avoidance of doubt, neither the voluntary sale of all or substantially all of the Companys assets, nor a merger involving the Company, shall be deemed to be a voluntary or involuntary liquidation,\ndissolution or winding up of the Company.) As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock had an aggregate Liquidation Preference of $64.0 million.\nConversion Rights. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 0.591 shares of the Companys common stock (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $1,692.00 per share) plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events, as described in the Series B Certificate of Designation. The conversion rate is not adjusted for accumulated and unpaid dividends. If converted, holders of Series B Preferred Stock do not receive a cash payment for all accumulated and unpaid dividends; rather, all accumulated and unpaid dividends are canceled.\nThe Company may, at its option, cause shares of Series B Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into that number of shares of its common stock that are issuable at the then-prevailing conversion rate. The Company may exercise its conversion right only if the closing price of its common stock exceeds 150% of the then-prevailing conversion price ($1,692.00 per share as of October 31, 2022) for 20 trading days during any consecutive 30 trading day period, as described in the Series B Certificate of Designation.\nIf the holders of Series B Preferred Stock elect to convert their shares in connection with certain fundamental changes (as defined in the Series B Certificate of Designation and described below), the Company will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock upon conversion or, in lieu thereof, the Company may in certain circumstances elect to adjust the conversion rate and related conversion obligation so that shares of Series B Preferred Stock are converted into shares of the acquiring or surviving company, in each case as described in the Series B Certificate of Designation.\nThe adjustment of the conversion price is to prevent dilution of the interests of the holders of the Series B Preferred Stock from certain dilutive transactions with holders of the Companys common stock.\nRedemption. The Company does not have the option to redeem the Series B Preferred Stock. However, holders of the Series B Preferred Stock can require the Company to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Preference of the shares to be redeemed in the case of a fundamental change (as further described in the Series B Certificate of Designation). A fundamental change will be deemed to have occurred if any of the following occurs:\n\u25cf any person or group is or becomes the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 50% or more of the total voting power of all classes of the Companys capital stock then outstanding and normally entitled to vote in the election of directors;\n\u25cf during any period of two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board of directors of the Company (together with any new directors whose election to the Companys board of directors or whose nomination for election by the stockholders was approved by a vote of 66 2/3% of the Companys directors then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors of the Company then in office;\n\u25cf the termination of trading of the Companys common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the common stock is not approved for trading or quoted on any other U.S. securities exchange or established over-the-counter trading market in the U.S.; or\n\u25cf the Company (i) consolidates with or merges with or into another person or another person merges with or into the Company or (ii) sells, assigns, transfers, leases, conveys or otherwise disposes of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to another person and, in the case of any such merger or consolidation described in clause (i), the securities that are outstanding immediately prior to such transaction (and which represent 100% of the aggregate voting power of the Companys voting stock) are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or property, unless pursuant to the transaction such securities are changed into or exchanged for securities of the surviving person that represent, immediately after such transaction, at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the voting stock of the surviving person.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, holders of shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will not have the right to require the Company to redeem their shares if:\n\u25cf the last reported sale price of shares of the Companys common stock for any five trading days within the 10 consecutive trading days ending immediately before the later of the fundamental change or its announcement equaled or exceeded 105% of the conversion price of the Series B Preferred Stock immediately before the fundamental change or announcement;\n\u25cf at least 90% of the consideration (excluding cash payments for fractional shares and in respect of dissenters appraisal rights) in the transaction or transactions constituting the fundamental change consists of shares of capital stock traded on a U.S. national securities exchange or quoted on The Nasdaq Stock Market, or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with a fundamental change, and as a result of the transaction or transactions, shares of Series B Preferred Stock become convertible into such publicly traded securities; or\n\u25cf in the case of a merger or consolidation constituting a fundamental change (as described in the fourth bullet above), the transaction is affected solely to change the Companys jurisdiction of incorporation.\nMoreover, the Company will not be required to redeem any Series B Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of a fundamental change if a third party makes an offer to purchase the Series B Preferred Stock in the manner, at the price, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth above and such third party purchases all shares of Series B Preferred Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn.\nThe Company may, at its option, elect to pay the redemption price in cash, in shares of the Companys common stock valued at a discount of 5% from the market price of shares of the Companys common stock, or in any combination thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may only pay such redemption price in shares of the Companys common stock that are registered under the Securities Act and eligible for immediate sale in the public market by non-affiliates of the Company.\nVoting Rights. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock currently have no voting rights; however, holders may receive certain voting rights, as described in the Series B Certificate of Designation, if (a) dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock, or any other class or series of stock ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends, shall be in arrears for dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, containing in the aggregate a number of days equivalent to six calendar quarters or (b) the Company fails to pay the redemption price, plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, on the redemption date for shares of Series B Preferred Stock following a fundamental change. In each such event, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock (voting separately as a class with all other classes or series of stock ranking on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) will be entitled to elect two directors to the Companys board of directors in addition to those directors already serving on the Companys board of directors at such time (the Series B Directors), at the next annual meeting of the Companys stockholders (or at a special meeting of the Companys stockholders called for such purpose, whichever is earlier). The right to elect the Series B Directors will continue for each subsequent annual meeting of the Companys stockholders until all dividends accumulated on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock have been fully paid or set aside for payment or the Company pays in full or sets aside for payment such redemption price, plus accrued but unpaid dividends, if any, on the redemption date for the shares of Series B Preferred Stock following a fundamental change. The term of office of any Series B Directors will terminate immediately upon the termination of the right of holders of Series B Preferred Stock to elect such Series B Directors, as described in this paragraph. Each holder of Series B Preferred Stock will have one vote for each share of Series B Preferred Stock held in the election of Series B Directors. The Company previously failed to make timely payment of the accrued dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the May 15, 2019 and August 15, 2019 dividend payment dates. Such amounts were fully paid on or about November 15, 2019.\nSo long as any shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the Company will not, without the consent of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding at the time (voting separately as a class with all other series of preferred stock, if any, on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable) issue or increase the authorized amount of any class or series of shares ranking senior to the outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividends or upon liquidation. In addition, the Company will not, subject to certain conditions, amend, alter or repeal provisions of the Companys certificate of\nincorporation, including the Series B Certificate of Designation, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to adversely amend, alter or affect any power, preference or special right of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock or the holders thereof without the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock.\nClass A Preferred Shares (the Series 1 Preferred Shares) of FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd.\nAs of October 31, 2020, FCE FuelCell Energy Ltd. (FCE Ltd.), one of the Companys indirect subsidiaries, had 1,000,000 Series 1 Preferred Shares issued and outstanding, which were held solely by Enbridge. The Company guaranteed the return of principal and dividend obligations of FCE Ltd. to Enbridge, as the holder of the Series 1 Preferred Shares, pursuant to the Guarantee, dated May 27, 2004, made by the Company in favor of Enbridge, as amended by the Guarantee Amending Agreement dated April 1, 2011 and effective as of January 1, 2011 between the Company and Enbridge (the Guarantee). Subsequent to the end of fiscal year 2020, the Company paid off these obligations to Enbridge.\nOn January 20, 2020, the Company, FCE Ltd. and Enbridge entered into a letter agreement (the January 2020 Letter Agreement), pursuant to which they agreed to amend the articles of FCE Ltd. relating to and setting forth the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares to: (i) remove the provisions of the articles permitting or requiring the issuance of shares of the Companys common stock in exchange for the Series 1 Preferred Shares or as payment of amounts due to the holders of the Series 1 Preferred Shares, (ii) remove certain provisions of the articles relating to the redemption of the Series 1 Preferred Shares, (iii) increase the annual dividend rate, commencing on January 1, 2020, to 15%, (iv) extend the final payment date for all accrued and unpaid dividends and all return of capital payments (i.e., payments of the principal redemption price) from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, (v) clarify when dividend and return of capital payments were to be made in the future and extend the quarterly dividend and return of capital payments through December 31, 2021 (which were previously to be paid each quarter through December 31, 2020), (vi) remove certain terms and provisions of the articles that are no longer applicable, and (vii) make other conforming changes to the articles. The articles of FCE Ltd. were amended and filed in accordance with the provisions of the January 2020 Letter Agreement on March 26, 2020. Under the amended articles, FCE Ltd. continued to be required to make (a) annual dividend payments of Cdn. $500,000 and (b) annual return of capital payments of Cdn. $750,000.\nThe amendment to the Series 1 Preferred Shares resulted in an extinguishment of the prior Series 1 Preferred Shares for accounting purposes. A revised fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow model resulting in a revised carrying value being recorded for the amended Series 1 Preferred Shares of Cdn. $23.4 million (U.S. $17.7 million) as of January 20, 2020, which resulted in a loss of Cdn. $0.2 million (U.S. $0.2 million) recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss during the year ended October 31, 2020. On an undiscounted basis, the Companys actual aggregate amount of all accrued and unpaid dividends to be paid on the Series 1 Preferred Shares as of October 31, 2020 totaled approximately Cdn. $23.2 million (U.S. $17.4 million) and the balance of the principal redemption price as of October 31, 2020 with respect to all of the Series 1 Preferred Shares totaled approximately Cdn. $4.3 million (U.S. $3.2 million).\nPrior to the amendment, the Company bifurcated embedded derivatives related to the conversion feature and a variable dividend feature. As a result of the January 2020 Letter Agreement, both features were removed from the Series 1 Preferred Shares which resulted in the Company recognizing a gain of $0.6 million related to the extinguishment of the embedded derivatives.\nThe following summary of the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares describes such terms as they existed on October 31, 2019 (prior to any modification covered by the January 2020 Letter Agreement and the resulting amendment of the articles of FCE Ltd.). The terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares required (i) annual dividend payments of Cdn. $500,000 and (ii) annual return of capital payments of Cdn. $750,000. Dividends accrued at a 1.25% quarterly rate on the unpaid principal balance, and additional dividends accrued on the cumulative unpaid dividends (inclusive of the Cdn. $12.5 million unpaid dividend balance as of the modification date) at a rate of 1.25% compounded quarterly. FCE Ltd. had the option, subject to the Company having sufficient authorized and unissued shares, of making dividend payments in the form of cash or shares of the Companys common stock under the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares.\nBecause the Series 1 Preferred Shares represented a mandatorily redeemable financial instrument, they were presented as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company made payments of Cdn. $1.9 million (or USD $1.6 million) during fiscal year 2020. The Companys return of capital and dividend payments were not made for the calendar quarters ended on March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019. During fiscal year 2020, the Company made the return of capital and dividend payments for the obligations due as of March 31, 2019, June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2019. The Company recorded interest expense, which reflects the amortization of the fair value discount of approximately Cdn. $4.0 million (or USD $2.9 million) in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020. As of October 31, 2020, the carrying value of the Series 1 Preferred Shares was Cdn. $25.6 million ($19.2 million) and was classified as preferred stock obligation of subsidiary on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn December 2020, the Company, FCE Ltd., and Enbridge entered into a payoff letter, pursuant to which the Company paid all amounts owed to Enbridge under the terms of the Series 1 Preferred Shares. As of the date of the payoff letter, the amount owed to Enbridge under the Series 1 Preferred Shares totaled Cdn. $27.4 million, which included Cdn. $4.3 million of principal and Cdn. $23.1 million of accrued dividends.\nOn December 18, 2020, the Company remitted payment totaling Cdn. $27.4 million, or approximately U.S. $21.5 million, to Enbridge. Upon making the payment, the Company recorded a loss on extinguishment for the Series 1 Preferred Shares of $0.9 million. Concurrent with receipt of the payment from the Company, Enbridge surrendered its Series 1 Preferred Shares in FCE Ltd., and the Guarantee and the January 2020 Letter Agreement were terminated. All obligations related to the Series 1 Preferred Shares were extinguished upon payment.\nNote 13. Segment Information\nWe are engaged in the development, design, production, construction, and servicing of high temperature fuel cells for clean electric power generation. Critical to the success of our business is, among other things, our research and development efforts, both through customer-sponsored projects and Company-sponsored projects. The research and development activities are viewed as another product line that contributes to the development, design, production and sale of fuel cell products, however, it is not considered a separate operating segment. The chief operating decision maker does not review and assess financial information at a discrete enough level to be able to assess performance of research and development activities as if they operated as a standalone business segment, therefore, the Company has identified one business segment: fuel cell power plant production and research.\nRevenues, by geographic location (based on the customers ordering location) for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nUnited States\n$\n60,290\n$\n58,393\n$\n67,750\nSouth Korea\n68,341\n8,161\n2,059\nEngland\nGermany\n1,113\n2,658\nSwitzerland\n-\nTotal\n$\n130,484\n$\n69,585\n$\n70,871\nService agreement and license revenue which is included within Service agreements revenues on the Consolidated Statement of Operations was $12.8 million, $19.8 million and $20.4 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLong-lived assets located outside of the United States as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 are not significant individually or in the aggregate.\nNote 14. Benefit Plans\nWe have stockholder approved equity incentive plans, a stockholder approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan and an employee tax-deferred savings plan, which are described in more detail below.\n2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan\nThe Companys 2018 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended and restated from time to time, the 2018 Incentive Plan) authorizes grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights (SARs), restricted stock awards (RSAs), restricted stock units (RSUs), performance shares, performance units and incentive awards to key employees, directors, consultants and advisors. Stock options, RSAs and SARs have restrictions as to transferability. Stock option exercise prices are fixed by the Companys Board of Directors but shall not be less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. SARs may be granted in conjunction with stock options.\nAt the May 8, 2020 reconvened 2020 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Companys stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the original 2018 Incentive Plan, which authorizes the Company to issue up to 4,000,000 additional shares of the Companys common stock pursuant to awards granted under the 2018 Incentive Plan and provides for an increase in the annual limit on the grant-date fair value of awards to any non-employee director of the Company from $200,000 to $250,000. Following the approval of the amended and restated 2018 Incentive Plan by the Companys stockholders in May of 2020, the 2018 Incentive Plan provided the Company with the authority to issue a total of 4,333,333 shares of the Companys common stock, 1,000,000 shares of which were reserved for settlement of RSUs granted pursuant to an employment agreement, effective as of August 26, 2019, between the Company and Jason Few, our President and Chief Executive Officer (the Sign-On Award). The Sign-On Award was contingent upon obtaining stockholder approval of a sufficient number of additional shares under the 2018 Incentive Plan. The Company previously recorded the grants as a liability and, after obtaining such stockholder approval, reclassified the liability to additional paid-in capital.\nOn April 8, 2021, the Companys stockholders approved another amendment and restatement of the 2018 Incentive Plan to authorize the Company to issue up to 8,000,000 additional shares of the Companys common stock pursuant to awards under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Following the approval of the amendment and restatement, the Company has the authority to issue a total of 12,333,333 shares of the Companys common stock under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Of the 12,333,333 shares of the Companys common stock authorized to be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan, 7,535,088 remained available for grant as of October 31, 2022.\nLong-Term Incentive Plans\nThe Companys Board of Directors periodically approves Long Term Incentive Plans which include performance-based awards tied to the Companys common stock price as well as time-vesting awards. None of the awards granted as part of Long-Term Incentive Plans include any dividend equivalent or other stockholder rights. To the extent the awards are earned, they may be settled in shares or cash of an equivalent value at the Companys option. These plans are further described below.\nFiscal Year 2020 Long Term Incentive Plan:\nOn August 24, 2020, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2020 (the FY 2020 LTI Plan) as a sub-plan consisting of awards made under the 2018 Incentive Plan. The participants in the FY 2020 LTI Plan are members of senior management. The performance shares granted in fiscal year 2020 will be earned over the performance period ending on October 31, 2022 but will remain subject to a continued service-based vesting requirement until the third anniversary of the date of grant. The FY 2020 LTI Plan consists of three award components:\n1) Relative total shareholder return (TSR) performance share unit (PSU) awards. The performance goal for the relative TSR PSUs is the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000 from May 8, 2020 through October 31, 2022. The Compensation Committee established the performance assessment criteria for the relative TSR PSUs as the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000, with the award calibration being 100% plus or minus 0.5x the difference between the Companys TSR and the Russell 2000 Index composite TSR. The award is capped at 200% of the target number of PSUs, and award is further capped at 100% of the target number of PSUs if the Companys absolute TSR over the performance period is negative. The Companys TSR is calculated by subtracting the Companys beginning stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to May 8, 2020) from the ending stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 31, 2022), adding any dividends during the period, and then dividing the result by the Companys beginning stock price. The Company calculated the performance payout percentage of 112.9% and accordingly has reserved shares equal to this percentage of the target number\nof PSUs, subject to vesting based on continued service until August 24, 2023 (the third anniversary of the grant date).\n2) Absolute TSR PSU awards. The performance goal for the absolute TSR PSUs is an increase in the Companys stock price from May 8, 2020 through October 31, 2022, with award calibration being based on a specified percentage increase in the price of the Companys common stock over the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day immediately prior to May 8, 2020, which was $1.8765. Specifically, a 50% increase earned 50% of the target award, a 100% increase earned 100% of the target award and a 150% increase earned 200% of the target award. Each price hurdle was required to be met and was met for 20 consecutive trading days during the performance period. The Compensation Committee certified achievement of a 150% increase during fiscal year 2021, resulting in an award percentage of 200%. As a result, the Company has reserved shares equal to 200% of the target number of PSUs, subject to vesting based on continued service until August 24, 2023 (the third anniversary of the grant date).\n3) Time-vesting restricted stock units. The time-vesting RSUs granted in fiscal year 2020 vest at a rate of one-third of the total number of RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.\nFiscal Year 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan:\nOn November 24, 2020, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2021 (the FY 2021 LTI Plan) as a sub-plan consisting of awards made under the 2018 Incentive Plan. The participants in the FY 2021 LTI Plan are members of senior management. The FY 2021 LTI Plan consists of three award components:\n1) Relative TSR PSU awards. The PSUs granted during the year ended October 31, 2021 will be earned over the performance period ending on October 31, 2023, but will remain subject to a continued service-based vesting requirement until the third anniversary of the date of grant. The performance measure for the relative TSR PSUs is the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000 from November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2023. The Compensation Committee established the performance assessment criteria for the relative TSR PSUs as the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000, with the award calibration being 100% plus or minus 0.5x the difference between the Companys TSR and the Russell 2000 Index composite TSR. The award is capped at 200% of the target number of PSUs, and the award is further capped at 100% of the target number of PSUs if the Companys absolute TSR over the performance period is negative. The Companys TSR is calculated by subtracting the Companys beginning stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 30, 2020) from the ending stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 31, 2023), adding any dividends during the period, and then dividing the result by the Companys beginning stock price. Any PSUs that are earned based on performance will be earned on the date that the Compensation Committee certifies the achievement of the applicable level of relative TSR. Given that the performance period is still open, the Company has reserved shares equal to 200% of the target number of PSUs, subject to performance during the remaining performance period as well as vesting based on continued service until November 24, 2023 (the third anniversary of the grant date).\n2) Absolute TSR PSU awards. The performance measure for the absolute TSR PSUs is an increase in the Companys stock price during the performance period of November 1, 2020 through October 31, 2023 with the award calibration being based on a specified percentage increase in the price of the Companys common stock over the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 30, 2020, which was $2.27. Specifically, a 25% increase earns 50% of the target award, a 50% increase earns 100% of the target award and a 100% increase earns 200% of the target award. Each price hurdle was required to be met and was met for 20 consecutive trading days during the performance period. The Compensation Committee certified achievement of a 150% increase during fiscal year 2021, resulting in an award percentage of 200%. As a result, the Company has reserved shares equal to 200% of the target number of PSUs, subject to vesting based on continued service until November 24, 2023 (the third anniversary of the grant date).\n3) Time-vesting restricted stock units. The time-vesting RSUs granted during the year ended October 31, 2021 vest at a rate of one-third of the total number of RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.\nFiscal Year 2022 Long Term Incentive Plan:\nOn December 10, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors approved a Long-Term Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2022 (the FY 2022 LTI Plan) as a sub-plan consisting of awards made under the 2018 Incentive Plan. The participants in the FY 2022 LTI Plan are members of senior management. The FY 2022 LTI Plan consists of two award components:\n1) Relative TSR PSU awards. The PSUs granted during the year ended October 31, 2022 will be earned over the performance period ending on October 31, 2024, but will remain subject to a continued service-based vesting requirement until the third anniversary of the date of grant. The performance measure for the relative TSR performance units is the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000 from November 1, 2021 through October 31, 2024. The Compensation Committee established the performance assessment criteria for the relative TSR PSUs as the TSR of the Company relative to the TSR of the Russell 2000, with the award calibration being 100% plus or minus 0.5x the difference between the Companys TSR and the Russell 2000 Index composite TSR. The award is capped at 200% of the target number of PSUs, and the award is further capped at 100% of the target number of PSUs if the Companys absolute TSR over the performance period is negative. The Companys TSR is calculated by subtracting the Companys beginning stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 31, 2021) from the ending stock price (defined as the average closing price of the Companys common stock over the 20 consecutive trading days ending on October 31, 2024), adding any dividends during the period, and then dividing the result by the Companys beginning stock price. Given that the performance period is still open, the Company has reserved shares equal to 200% of the target number of PSUs, subject to performance during the remaining performance period as well as vesting based on continued service until December 10, 2024 (the third anniversary of the grant date).\n2) Time-vesting restricted stock units. The time-vesting RSUs granted during the year ended October 31, 2022 will vest at a rate of one-third of the total number of RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.\nOther Equity Incentive Plans\nThe Companys 2006 and 2010 Equity Incentive Plans remain in effect only to the extent of awards outstanding under the plans as of October 31, 2022.\nShare-based compensation was reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended October 31,\nCost of revenues\n$\n$\n$\nAdministrative and selling expense\n5,418\n3,593\n1,424\nResearch and development expense\n$\n6,580\n$\n4,197\n$\n1,822\nStock Options\nWe account for stock options awarded to non-employee directors under the fair value method.

The PSUs were valued based on a Monte-Carlo Simulation, and the estimated fair value of the 169,026 relative TSR PSUs was $11.70 per share. The PSUs and time-based vesting RSUs are expensed over the three-year performance period. During fiscal year 2022, an additional 19,566 PSUs and 65,219 time-based vesting RSUs were issued to new hires that joined during the fiscal year.\nIn addition to senior management, the Board of Directors also approved time-based RSU awards totaling 599,271 RSUs to certain salaried employees during fiscal year 2022 to promote ownership of the Companys equity and retention. The time-based vesting RSUs granted during the fiscal year ended October 31, 2022 will vest at a rate of one-third of the total number of RSUs on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant.\nOutstanding RSUs as of October 31, 2021 included 1,000,000 RSUs granted as the Sign-On Award to Jason Few, the Companys President and Chief Executive Officer (the CEO), pursuant to the August 26, 2019 employment agreement between the Company and the CEO. Pursuant to the terms of such Sign-On Award, 500,000 RSUs vested on August 26, 2022. The remaining 500,000 RSUs (Additional RSUs) would vest if, during the 30 days prior to the vesting date of August 26, 2022, the weighted average price of the Companys common stock exceeded $1.00. The number of Additional RSUs issued would range from zero for a weighted average price of $1.00 to a maximum of 500,000 RSUs for a weighted average price of $6.00, with linear interpolation for stock prices between $1.00 and $6.00. The weighted average price of the Companys common stock was between $4.00 and $5.00 on August 26, 2022 and as a result, 278,788 Additional RSUs vested.\nPSUs are issued assuming participants achieve 100% target performance. The Company also reserves additional shares assuming the maximum performance targets are met. As of October 31, 2022, the Company had reserved an additional 293,408 shares for potential issuance under the FY 2020 LTI Plan, an additional 429,304 shares for potential issuance under the FY 2021 LTI Plan and an additional 188,592 shares for potential issuance under the FY 2022 LTI Plan.\nRSU and PSU expense is based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting period, which is generally over 3 or 4 years.\nAs of October 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs and PSUs was $10.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over approximately the next two years on a weighted-average basis.\nStock Awards\nDuring the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we awarded 76,848, 31,889 and 58,303 shares, respectively, of fully vested, unrestricted common stock to the independent members of our Board of Directors as a component of Board of Director compensation which resulted in recognizing $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million of expense for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) was approved by the Companys stockholders at the 2018 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The adoption of the ESPP allows the Company to provide eligible employees of FuelCell Energy, Inc. and certain of its designated subsidiaries with the opportunity to voluntarily participate in the ESPP, enabling such participants to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a discount to market price at the time of such purchase. The maximum number of the Companys shares of common stock that may be issued under the ESPP is 30,248 shares.\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees have the right to purchase shares of common stock at the lesser of (i) 85% of the last reported sale price of our common stock on the first business day of the offering period, or (ii) 85% of the last reported sale price of the common stock on the last business day of the offering period, in either case rounded up to avoid impermissible trading fractions. Shares issued pursuant to the ESPP contain a legend restricting the transfer or sale of such common stock for a period of 0.5 year after the date of purchase.\nThe ESPP activity for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was de minimis.\nEmployee Tax-Deferred Savings Plans\nWe offer a 401(k) plan (the 401(k) Plan) to all full time employees that provides for tax-deferred salary deductions for eligible employees (beginning the first month following an employees hire date). Employees may choose to make voluntary contributions of their annual compensation to the 401(k) Plan, limited to an annual maximum amount as set periodically by the IRS. Employee contributions are fully vested when made. Under the 401(k) Plan, there is no option available to the employee to receive or purchase our common stock. Matching contributions of 2% under the 401(k) Plan aggregated $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nThe components of loss before income taxes for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nU.S.\n$\n(145,439)\n$\n(96,959)\n$\n(85,865)\nForeign\n(974)\n(4,064)\n(3,196)\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(146,413)\n$\n(101,023)\n$\n(89,061)\nThe Company recorded an income tax provision totaling $0.8 million, $0 million and $0 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The income tax expense primarily related to foreign income taxes in South Korea and Canada.\nFranchise tax expense, which is included in administrative and selling expenses, was $1.0 million, $0.5 million and $0.3 million for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n(21.0)\n%\n(21.0)\n%\n(21.0)\n%\nIncrease (decrease) in income taxes resulting from:\nState taxes, net of Federal benefits\n(3.6)\n%\n(5.2)\n%\n(1.1)\n%\nForeign withholding tax\n0.6\n%\n0.2\n%\n-\n%\nNet operating loss expiration, impairment and true-ups\n8.7\n%\n3.6\n%\n129.2\n%\nNondeductible expenditures\n1.4\n%\n1.9\n%\n1.4\n%\nChange in tax rates\n0.3\n%\n(1.3)\n%\n(0.6)\n%\nFair value adjustment on warrants\n-\n%\n3.3\n%\n8.7\n%\nOther, net\n0.7\n%\n-\n%\n1.1\n%\nDeferred only adjustment\n(0.1)\n%\n0.8\n%\n4.4\n%\nValuation allowance\n13.6\n%\n17.9\n%\n(122.1)\n%\nEffective income tax rate\n0.6\n%\n0.2\n%\n-\n%\nOur deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets:\nCompensation and benefit accruals\n$\n8,523\n$\n7,891\nBad debt and other allowances\n2,453\n1,081\nCapital loss and tax credit carry-forwards\n14,310\n15,191\nNet operating losses (domestic and foreign)\n123,825\n113,733\nDeferred license revenue\n1,548\n1,885\nAccumulated depreciation\n20,229\n12,379\nGrant revenue\nExcess business interest\n10,424\n9,695\nOperating lease liabilities\n2,085\n2,211\nGross deferred tax assets:\n183,872\n164,675\nValuation allowance\n(180,048)\n(160,530)\nDeferred tax assets after valuation allowance\n3,824\n4,145\nDeferred tax liability:\nIn process research and development\n(2,475)\n(2,510)\nRight of use assets\n(1,809)\n(1,964)\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(460)\n$\n(329)\nWe continually evaluate our deferred tax assets as to whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Based on the projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are realizable, management believes that significant uncertainty exists surrounding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. As of October 31, 2022, we had $393.7 million of federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards that expire in the years 2023 to 2038 and $556.5 million of state NOL carryforwards that expire in the years 2023 through 2041. Additionally, we had $11.2 million of state tax credits available that will expire from tax years 2023 to 2040.\nDuring the 2020 tax year, the Company experienced an ownership change as defined by Internal Revenue Code Section 382. As a result, the utilization of federal and state NOLs generated prior to October of 2020 is subject to limitation and a reduction was made in fiscal year 2020 to the carrying balance of the federal and state NOLs to reflect the future limitation on utilization. The Company has updated its analysis of potential ownership changes through October 31, 2022 and concluded that no additional ownership changes have occurred subsequent to October 2020. In addition, the acquisition of Versa in fiscal year 2013 triggered a Section 382 ownership change at the level of Versa Power System which will limit the future usage of some of the federal and state NOLs that we acquired in that transaction. Accordingly, a valuation allowance has been recorded against the deferred tax asset associated with these attributes to reflect the future limitation on utilization.\nThe Companys financial statements reflect expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return (including a decision whether to file or not file a return in a particular jurisdiction) presuming the taxing authorities full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts.\nThe Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits as of October 31, 2022 and 2021. It is our policy to record interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income taxes; however, because of our significant NOLs, no provision for interest or penalties has been recorded.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. and certain states, primarily Connecticut and California, as well as income tax returns required internationally for South Korea and Germany. We are open to examination by the IRS and various states in which we file for fiscal year 2002 to the present.\nNote 16. Loss Per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per common share (EPS) are generally calculated as income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is generally calculated as income (loss) available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of common share equivalents.\nThe calculation of basic and diluted EPS for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts):\nYear ended October 31,\nNumerator\nNet loss attributable to FuelCell Energy, Inc.\n$\n(142,722)\n(101,055)\n$\n(89,107)\nSeries B preferred stock dividends\n(3,200)\n(3,200)\n(3,331)\nNet loss attributable to common stockholders\n$\n(145,922)\n$\n(104,255)\n$\n(92,438)\nDenominator\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - basic\n383,139,140\n334,742,346\n221,960,288\nEffect of dilutive securities (1)\n-\n-\n-\nWeighted average common shares outstanding - diluted\n383,139,140\n334,742,346\n221,960,288\nNet loss to common stockholders per share - basic\n$\n(0.38)\n$\n(0.31)\n$\n(0.42)\nNet loss to common stockholders per share - diluted (1)\n$\n(0.38)\n$\n(0.31)\n$\n(0.42)\n(1) Due to the net loss to common stockholders in each of the years presented above, diluted earnings per share was computed without consideration to potentially dilutive instruments as their inclusion would have been antidilutive. As of October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, potentially dilutive securities excluded from the diluted loss per share calculation are as follows:\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nOrion Warrants\n-\n-\n2,700,000\nMay 2017 Offering - Series C Warrants\n-\n950,102\n964,114\nOutstanding options to purchase common stock\n20,231\n22,388\n23,891\nUnvested Restricted Stock Awards\n-\n-\nUnvested Restricted Stock Units\n2,520,881\n2,543,541\n2,066,602\n5% Series B Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock\n37,837\n37,837\n37,837\nTotal potentially dilutive securities\n2,578,949\n3,553,868\n5,792,982\nNote 17. Restricted Cash\nAs of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there was $23.0 million and $28.0 million, respectively, of restricted cash and cash equivalents pledged as performance security, reserved for future debt service requirements, and reserved for letters of credit for certain banking requirements and contracts. The allocation of restricted cash is as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 31,\nOctober 31,\nCash Restricted for Outstanding Letters of Credit (1)\n$\n4,993\n$\n6,478\nCash Restricted for PNC Sale-Leaseback Transactions (2)\n5,010\n5,514\nCash Restricted for Crestmark Sale-Leaseback Transactions (3)\n2,894\n2,887\nBridgeport Fuel Cell Park Project Debt Service and Performance Reserves (4)\n8,746\n11,937\nOther\n1,346\n1,183\nTotal Restricted Cash\n22,989\n27,999\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents - Short-Term (5)\n(4,423)\n(11,268)\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents - Long-Term\n$\n18,566\n$\n16,731\n(1) Letters of credit outstanding as of October 31, 2022 expire on various dates through August 2028.\n(2) Long and short-term reserve that is to be used primarily to fund future module exchanges for operating projects falling under the PNC sale leaseback obligations. The decrease in restricted cash at October 31, 2022 compared to October 31, 2021 is a result of the Companys performance in completing certain module exchanges, which resulted in the cash restriction being released.\n(3) Long and short-term reserve that is to be used primarily to fund future module exchanges and other performance obligations.\n(4) Long and short-term reserves for the Bridgeport Fuel Cell Park Project to fund future module exchanges and other performance requirements.\n(5) Short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are amounts expected to be released and categorized as unrestricted cash within twelve months of the balance sheet date.\nNote 18. Commitments and Contingencies\nService Agreements\nUnder the provisions of its service agreements, the Company provides services to maintain, monitor, and repair customer power plants to meet minimum operating levels. Under the terms of such service agreements, the particular power plant must meet a minimum operating output during defined periods of the term. If minimum output falls below the contract requirement, the Company may be subject to performance penalties and/or may be required to repair or replace the customers fuel cell module(s).\nPower Purchase Agreements\nUnder the terms of the Companys PPAs, customers agree to purchase power from the Companys fuel cell power plants at negotiated rates. Electricity rates are generally a function of the customers current and estimated future electricity pricing available from the grid. As owner or lessee of the power plants, the Company is responsible for all operating costs necessary to maintain, monitor and repair the power plants. Under certain agreements, the Company is also responsible for procuring fuel, generally natural gas or biogas, to run the power plants. In addition, under the terms of some of the PPAs, the Company may be subject to a performance penalty if the Company does not meet certain performance requirements.\nProject Fuel Exposure\nCertain of our PPAs for project assets in our generation operating portfolio and project assets under construction expose us to fluctuating fuel price risks as well as the risk of being unable to procure the required amounts of fuel and the lack of alternative available fuel sources. We seek to mitigate our fuel risk using strategies including: (i) fuel cost reimbursement mechanisms in our PPAs to allow for pass through of fuel costs (full or partial) where possible, which we have done with our 14.9 MW operating project in Bridgeport, CT; (ii) procuring fuel under fixed price physical contracts with investment grade counterparties, which we have done for twenty years for our Tulare BioMAT project and the initial seven years of\nthe eighteen year PPA for our LIPA Yaphank Project; and (iii) potentially entering into future financial hedges with investment grade counterparties to offset potential negative market fluctuations.\nWe currently have three projects in development with fuel sourcing risk, which are the Toyota project, which requires procurement of RNG, and our Derby, CT 14.0 MW and 2.8 MW projects, both of which require natural gas for which there is no pass-through mechanism. Fuel sourcing and risk mitigation strategies for all three projects are being assessed and will be implemented as project operational dates become firm. Such strategies may require cash collateral or reserves to secure fuel or related contracts for these three projects. If the Company is unable to secure fuel on favorable economic terms, it may result in impairment charges to the Derby project assets and further charges for the Toyota project asset.\nWhile the Company is pursuing alternative sources of RNG for the Toyota project, charges are being recorded to cost of generation revenues for any project expenditure which may be unrecoverable. To date, $24.9 million in charges have been recorded, which includes $2.8 million in charges for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 and $22.1 million in charges for the year ended October 31, 2022. As of October 31, 2022, the carrying value of the Toyota project on the Consolidated Balance Sheet totaled $21.9 million which represents the carrying value of inventory components that could be redeployed for alternative use.\nGiven the rise in natural gas prices through and as of October 31, 2022, the Company performed a recoverability analysis with respect to the Derby 14.0 MW and 2.8 MW projects and concluded that the assets are recoverable and therefore an impairment has not occurred. Should natural gas prices continue to rise, there could be an impairment in future periods. The Company has risk mitigation strategies that it may implement in an effort to mitigate potential impacts including the ability to extend commercial operations dates. As of October 31, 2022, the carrying value of the 14.0 MW project in Derby, CT totaled $29.3 million and the carrying value of the 2.8 MW project in Derby, CT totaled $0.3 million.\nOther\nAs of October 31, 2022, the Company had unconditional purchase commitments aggregating $67.1 million, for materials, supplies and services in the normal course of business.\nLegal Proceedings\nSettlement Agreement with POSCO Energy\nFrom approximately 2007 through 2015, the Company relied on POSCO Energy Co., Ltd. (POSCO Energy) to develop and grow the South Korean and Asian markets for its products and services. The Company received upfront license fees and was entitled to receive royalty income from POSCO Energy pursuant to certain manufacturing and technology transfer agreements, including the Alliance Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Technology Transfer, License and Distribution Agreement dated February 7, 2007 (and amendments thereto), the Stack Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 27, 2009 (and amendments thereto), and the Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement dated October 31, 2012 (and amendments thereto), which are collectively referred to herein as the License Agreements. The License Agreements provided POSCO Energy with the exclusive technology rights to manufacture, sell, distribute and service the Companys SureSource 300, SureSource 1500, and SureSource 3000 fuel cell technology in the South Korean and broader Asian markets. Due to certain actions and inactions of POSCO Energy, we did not realize any new material revenues, royalties or new projects developed by POSCO Energy between late 2015 and January 2022, at which time we began to recognize revenues in connection with sales of replacement modules to a subsidiary of POSCO Energy.\nIn November 2019, POSCO Energy spun-off its fuel cell business into a new entity, Korea Fuel Cell Co., Ltd. (KFC), without the Companys consent. As part of the spin-off, POSCO Energy transferred manufacturing and service rights under the License Agreements to KFC, but retained distribution rights and severed its own liability under the License Agreements. The Company formally objected to POSCO Energys spin-off.\nOn April 27, 2020, POSCO Energy initiated a series of three arbitration demands against the Company at the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce seated in Singapore, in which it alleged certain warranty defects in a sub-megawatt conditioning facility at its facility in Pohang, South Korea and sought combined damages of approximately $3.3 million. Prior to filing the arbitrations, POSCO Energy obtained provisional attachments from the Seoul Central District Court attaching certain revenues owed to the Company by Korea Southern Power Company\n(KOSPO) as part of such warranty claims, which delayed receipt of certain payments owed to the Company. POSCO Energy subsequently sought additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on unspecified warranty claims in an additional amount of approximately $7 million, and additional provisional attachments on KOSPO revenues from the Seoul Central District Court based on its alleged counterclaims in the license termination arbitration described below in an additional amount of approximately $110 million. As of October 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding accounts receivable due from KOSPO of $11.2 million, which amount was recovered from the Seoul Central District Court during the second quarter of fiscal year 2022.\nIn June 2020, the Company terminated the License Agreements and filed a demand for arbitration against POSCO Energy and KFC in the International Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce. In October 2020, POSCO Energy filed a counterclaim in the arbitration.\nThe Company discontinued revenue recognition of the deferred license revenue related to the License Agreements in July 2020 given the then-pending arbitrations.\nIn order to resolve the Companys disputes with POSCO Energy and KFC, on December 20, 2021, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Agreement) with POSCO Energy and KFC (POSCO Energy and KFC may be collectively referred to herein as PE Group). The Settlement Agreement provides, among other things, that the parties will cooperate in good faith to effect a market transition to the Company of the molten carbonate fuel cell business in Korea in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Settlement Agreement. To that end, the Settlement Agreement provides that any and all past, current, or potential disputes and claims between the Company, on the one hand, and POSCO Energy and KFC, on the other, of any nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, asserted or not asserted, based on actions or omissions of any party on or before the date of Settlement Agreement are fully and finally settled, including such disputes and claims, directly or indirectly, in connection with the legal disputes and License Agreements described above, with the exception of (i) an unfiled claim by the Company in the amount of approximately $1.8 million with respect to certain royalties the Company believes are owed by POSCO Energy with respect to replacement modules deployed by POSCO Energy at Gyenonggi Green Energy and other sites for which POSCO Energy has not paid royalties, and (ii) an unfiled claim by POSCO Energy in an unknown amount with respect to a series of purchase orders for materials and components which began in 2014 under a supply chain contract, both of which claims remain unsettled. The Company does not believe the claim by POSCO Energy with respect to purchase orders for materials and components under the supply chain contract has merit and the Company retains the right to file a counterclaim for damages it believes it has incurred with respect to such supply chain contract.\nUnder the Settlement Agreement, the parties also agreed that, within five days of the date thereof, the Company would withdraw its objection to the spin-off of KFC from POSCO Energy, and that the License Agreements are not terminated, but instead are deemed to be amended such that POSCO Energy and KFC only have the right (i) to provide maintenance and repair services to PE Groups existing customers on existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under LTSAs currently in force as well as LTSAs that have expired and are pending renewal as of the settlement date (collectively, Existing LTSAs), (ii) to supply replacement modules purchased from the Company only for their existing customers for existing molten carbonate power generation and thermal projects under Existing LTSAs and (iii) to own, operate and maintain all facilities and factories solely for the purposes set forth in (i) and (ii) above (collectively, the Right to Service License). POSCO Energy and KFC further agreed that, as of the date of the Settlement Agreement, the License Agreements were deemed to be amended such that the Company exclusively enjoys all rights as to the Companys technology in Korea and Asia, other than the Right to Service License. The Settlement Agreement further provides that the License Agreements will terminate automatically upon sixty days prior written notice to PE Group if (i) the Company enters into a business collaboration agreement with a Korean company to construct, assemble, manufacture, market, sell, distribute, import, export, install, commission, service, maintain, or repair products incorporating the Companys technology, or otherwise conduct the Companys business, in the Korean market; or (ii) the Company expands the capacity of its existing Korean entity such as to perform such activities itself. In the event of the termination of the License Agreements, the license granted to PE Group under the Right to Service License will continue notwithstanding the termination of the License Agreements, except that PE Groups right to own, operate, and maintain all facilities and factories for the purpose of servicing any orders or requests made by the Company will terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, PE Group has no right to manufacture modules or any other product incorporating the Companys technology under the License Agreements as amended, the Right to Service License or otherwise unless requested and authorized by the Company to do so.\nThe Settlement Agreement further provides that, in order to service its existing customers under the Existing LTSAs, KFC would place a firm, non-cancelable order for twelve SureSource 3000 modules within two weeks after the date of the Settlement Agreement and an additional firm, non-cancelable order for eight SureSource 3000 modules on or before June 30, 2022, all at a price of $3.0 million per module. The Company received firm, non-cancelable orders from KFC for a total of twenty SureSource 3000 modules in fiscal year 2022. All of these modules were delivered Ex Works from the Companys facility in Torrington, CT in fiscal year 2022.\nIn addition, KFC agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to order fourteen additional SureSource 3000 modules by December 31, 2022, at a price of $3.0 million per module if ordered by such date. KFC has indicated that it does not intend to order additional modules by December 31, 2022.\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, with respect to new modules supplied by the Company and deployed by PE Group to its existing customers, the Company will provide its standard warranty against module defects until the earlier of eighteen months from the date of shipment or twelve months from the date of installation. As part of the global settlement of the disputes among the parties and subject to the qualifications set forth in the Settlement Agreement, the Company will reimburse PE Group for any annual output penalty amount paid by PE Group to its customers pursuant to Existing LTSAs (whether such Existing LTSA is extended or renewed), caused by a shortfall or defect in the new modules for a period of up to seven years. The maximum annual reimbursement obligation with regard to any PE Group customer for any new module provided by the Company will not exceed an amount equal to 7.5% per year of the module purchase price. The Company will not be required to reimburse PE Group for any penalty paid by PE Group under the Existing LTSAs that is not caused by a shortfall or defect in the modules to be supplied by the Company including, without limitation, any shortfall or defect caused by a site-related problem, a problem with the balance of plant, or other components of the project.\nAlthough the Company has the exclusive and unrestricted right under the Settlement Agreement to perform, pursue, and otherwise conduct its business in relation to new fuel cell projects (including new projects with PE Groups existing customers) in Korea and Asia, the parties have agreed that, except as further provided in the Settlement Agreement with respect to PE Groups existing customers Noeul Green Energy and Godeok Green Energy, the Company will not engage in discussions with PE Groups existing customers regarding Existing LTSAs without PE Groups consent. The parties have further agreed that if PE Group cannot enter into an agreement with its existing customers to extend or renew Existing LTSAs by December 31, 2022, PE Group will cooperate with the Company so that the Company may discuss and, at the Companys sole discretion, enter into an extension of an Existing LTSA, a new LTSA to replace an Existing LTSA, or a module sales agreement with PE Groups existing customers; provided that (i) should the Company enter into such an arrangement with a PE Group existing customer, and (ii) the Company is required to provide replacement modules to such existing customer under such arrangement, and (iii) PE Group has not already deployed all or some of the modules that PE Group ordered under the Settlement Agreement, the Company will purchase the number of required replacement modules from PE Group at a price of $3.0 million per module (to the extent such modules are available and have not yet been deployed). The purchase of such replacement modules by the Company is contingent upon the modules being in proper condition as determined by inspection process to be agreed to by the parties. Any modules purchased by the Company from PE Group under these terms will be included as part of the firm orders KFC is required to make pursuant to the Settlement Agreement.\nWith respect to operations and maintenance agreements, the Settlement Agreement provides that KFC will have the right of first refusal on providing operation and maintenance services on commercially reasonable terms for new LTSAs entered into by the Company in Korea for a period of the first to occur of either twenty-four months after the date of the Settlement Agreement or until such time as the Company engages a third party capable of providing such services in Korea. If the Company and KFC agree that KFC should provide operation and maintenance services pursuant to the right of first refusal, the Company and KFC will enter into one or more operation and maintenance agreements that reflect commercially reasonable terms and conditions as agreed by the Company and KFC at that time.\nWith respect to BOP, KFC currently has eight units of BOP available, and the Settlement Agreement provides that the Company has the option to purchase such units of BOP for any new molten carbonate fuel cell projects within Korea at a price of KRW 2,550,000,000 per unit (or USD $1,787,550 per unit as of October 31, 2022). The Company will also have a non-exclusive, non-transferrable, non-sublicensable license to use the intellectual property imbedded in the BOP units in Korea in consideration for a reasonable license fee to be separately agreed by the parties. Detailed terms and conditions of BOP and related software and firmware supply will be discussed and agreed to in good faith in separate BOP supply agreements in the event the Company exercises its option to purchase any of such BOP.\nThe Company retained outside counsel on a contingency basis to pursue its claims against POSCO Energy and KFC, and outside counsel entered into an agreement with a litigation finance provider to fund the legal fees and expenses of the arbitration proceedings brought by the Company against POSCO Energy and KFC. Because the Company entered into the Settlement Agreement, it was required to remit fees to its counsel, Wiley Rein, LLP (Wiley), subject to the terms of its engagement letter with Wiley. On December 23, 2021, the Company agreed that it would pay Wiley a total of $24.0 million to satisfy all obligations to Wiley under the Companys engagement letter (which is included in Administrative and selling expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss for the year ended October 31, 2022). The total amount of $24.0 million was paid in full during the year ended October 31, 2022.\nOther Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is involved in other legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, regulatory proceedings, claims, mediations, arbitrations and litigation, arising out of the ordinary course of its business (Other Legal Proceedings). Although the Company cannot assure the outcome of such Other Legal Proceedings, management presently believes that the result of such Other Legal Proceedings, either individually, or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, and no material amounts have been accrued in the Companys consolidated financial statements with respect to these matters.\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company launched a proactive response to the escalating COVID-19 outbreak and temporarily suspended operations at its Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility in March 2020. The Company also commenced remote work protocol for those employees worldwide that were capable of working from home. The Company took these actions to secure the safety of the Companys employees, our corporate community as a whole, and the communities in which our team members live, and to adhere to Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommendations of social distancing and limited public exposure in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. All employees that were not able to work from home during the manufacturing facility shutdown due to their job function received full wages and benefits during such time. We did not implement any furlough, layoff or shared work program during such time. The Company resumed manufacturing in June 2020 and the Torrington, Connecticut manufacturing facility employees returned to work. We established a phased-in return-to-work schedule commencing March 15, 2021 for those employees working from home which was completed in April 2021. While the Company did not experience any significant disruption to its operations in fiscal year 2022, we continue to evaluate our ability to operate in the event of a resurgence of serious illness related to COVID-19 and the advisability of continuing operations based on federal, state and local guidance, evolving data concerning the pandemic and the best interests of our employees, customers and stockholders.\nNote 19.

Subsequent Events\nGroton Project - Commercial Operations Achieved at 6 MW\nOn December 16, 2022, the Company declared and, per the terms of the Amended and Restated Power Purchase Agreement between the Company and CMEEC entered into on that date (the Amended and Restated PPA), CMEEC agreed that the Groton Project is commercially operational at 6 MW. As of December 16, 2022, the Groton Project will be reported as a part of the Companys operating generation portfolio. The Amended and Restated PPA allows the Company to operate the plant at a reduced output of approximately 6 MW while a Technical Improvement Plan (TIP) is implemented over the next year with the goal of bringing the platform to its rated capacity of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023. In conjunction with entering into the Amended and Restated PPA, the Navy also provided its authorization to proceed with commercial operations at 6 MW. The Company paid CMEEC an amendment fee of $1.225 million and will incur performance guarantee fees under the Amended and Restated PPA as a result of operating at an output below 7.4 MW during implementation of the TIP. Although the Company believes it will successfully implement the TIP within approximately one year and bring the plant up to its nominal output of 7.4 MW, no assurance can be provided that such work will be successful. In the event that the plant does not reach an output of 7.4 MW by December 31, 2023, the Amended and Restated PPA will continue in effect, and the Company will be subject to ongoing performance guarantee fees as set forth in the Amended and Restated PPA.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, in August 2021, the Company closed on a tax equity financing transaction with East West Bancorp, Inc. (East West Bank) for the Groton Project. East West Banks tax equity commitment totals $15 million. In connection with the initial closing, the Company drew down $3.0 million. Under subsequent amendments, the terms of East West Banks remaining investment commitment of $12.0 million were modified such that East West Bank will now contribute $4.0 million on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Groton Project achieving commercial operations, rather than contributing the full $12.0 million when the Groton Project achieves commercial operations. In conjunction with the amendments, the Company agreed to pay aggregate fees of $0.5 million, which were paid upon the Company declaring commencement of commercial operations of the plant on December 16, 2022.\nWith the declaration of commercial operations, East West Banks investment in the project has been reclassified as a non-redeemable noncontrolling interest as of December 16, 2022.\nAmendment No. 3 to Joint Development Agreement with EMTEC\nOn December 19, 2022, the Company and EMTEC entered into Amendment No. 3 to the Joint Development Agreement between the Company and EMTEC, effective as of December 1, 2022 (such amendment, Amendment No. 3 and such agreement, as amended, the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement). In Amendment No. 3, the Company and EMTEC agreed to further extend the term of the EMTEC Joint Development Agreement such that it will end on August 31, 2023 (unless terminated earlier) and to further increase the maximum amount of research costs to be reimbursed by EMTEC from $50.0 million to $60.0 million. Amendment No. 3 is intended to (i) allow for continuation of research that would enable the parties to finalize data collection in support of the project gate decision to use the developed technology in a Company fuel cell module demonstration for capturing carbon at ExxonMobils Rotterdam facility, (ii) allow for the continuation of the development, engineering and mechanical derisking of the Generation 2 Technology fuel cell module prototype, and (iii) allow for studying the manufacturing scale-up and cost reduction of a commercial Generation 2 Technology fuel cell carbon capture facility.

Based on that evaluation, the Companys principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nManagement of FuelCell Energy, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we evaluated the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this assessment, we have concluded that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022 based on the specified criteria. The Companys independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has issued an audit report on the Companys internal control over financial reporting, which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
