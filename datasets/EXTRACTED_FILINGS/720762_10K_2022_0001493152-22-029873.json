    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nGeneral\nNon-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company, NIMS, we, us or our) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on July 16, 1980. The Companys offices are located at 4400 Biscayne Boulevard, Miami, Florida, 33137 and its telephone number is (305) 575-4207.\nCompany Overview\nOur primary business previously consisted of research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of non-invasive, motorized, whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) platforms. These therapeutic acceleration platforms are intended as aids to temporarily increase local circulation for temporary relief of minor aches and pains, produce local muscle relaxation and reduce morning stiffness.\nIn May 2019, we effectively discontinued operations. The Company is a shell company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nProducts\nWe currently have no inventory and do not have any of our products available for sale. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur future operating results may vary substantially from anticipated results due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. The following discussion highlights some of these factors and the possible impact of these factors on our future results of operations. If any of the following events actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially harmed. In that case, the value of our common stock could decline substantially.\nRisks Relating to Our Business.\nWe have a history of operating losses, we do not expect to become profitable in the near future and absent additional equity or debt financing, we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were prepared on a going concern basis; however substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result of recurring losses and an accumulated deficit. We are not profitable and have been incurring material losses. Our net losses for our fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 were $0.2 million and $0.2 million respectively. As of July 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $28.5 million. The Company had $15,000 of cash at July 31, 2022 and negative working capital of approximately $249,000. Absent additional equity or debt financing, we will be unable to continue as a going concern, and you may lose all of your investment in us.\nWe will require additional funding, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe will need to raise additional capital in order for us to continue as a going concern. We will need to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. We do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that we could obtain such approval. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our shareholders may experience significant dilution, and debt financing, if available, may require that we agree to covenants that restrict our operations. To the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our products or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not declared and paid cash dividends on our common stock in the past, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain all of our earnings, if any, for the foreseeable future to finance the operation and expansion of our business. As a result, you may only receive a return on your investment in our common stock if the market price of our common stock increases and you sell your shares.\nBecause our common stock is a penny stock, it may be more difficult for investors to sell shares of our common stock, and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur common stock, which trades on the OTC PINK, is a penny stock since, among other things, the stock price is below $5.00 per share, it is not listed on a national securities exchange, and it has not met certain net tangible asset or average revenue requirements. Broker-dealers who sell penny stocks must provide purchasers of these stocks with a standardized risk-disclosure document prepared by the SEC. This document provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks involved in investing in the penny-stock market. A broker must also give a purchaser, orally or in writing, bid and offer quotations and information regarding broker and salesperson compensation, make a written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and obtain the purchasers written agreement to the purchase. Broker-dealers must also provide customers that hold penny stock in their accounts with such broker-dealer a monthly statement containing price and market information relating to the penny stock. If a penny stock is sold to an investor in violation of the penny stock rules, the investor may be able to cancel its purchase and get its money back.\nIf applicable, the penny stock rules may make it difficult for investors to sell their shares of our common stock. Because of the rules and restrictions applicable to a penny stock, there is less trading in penny stocks and the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected. Also, many brokers choose not to participate in penny stock transactions. Accordingly, investors may not always be able to resell their shares of our common stock publicly at times and prices acceptable to them.\nOur stock price has been volatile and there may not be an active, liquid trading market for our common stock.\nOur stock price has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and may continue to experience volatility in the future. The price of our common stock has ranged between $0.01 and $0.04 for the 52-week period ended July 31, 2022. Many factors, including those described in this report and others, have a significant impact on the price of our common stock. Also, you may not be able to sell your shares at the best market price if trading in our stock in not active or if the volume is low. There is no guarantee that an active trading market for our common stock will be maintained on the OTC PINK or elsewhere.\nOur quarterly results of operations may fluctuate, and these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate in the future. These fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline. As a result, in some future quarters our financial or operating results may not meet the expectations of potential securities analysts and investors which could result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nShareholders may experience dilution of ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock and our preferred stock.\nIn the future, we may issue our authorized but previously unissued equity securities, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present shareholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 designated shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors. As of October 28, 2022, there were outstanding 154,810,655 shares of our common stock, 100 shares of our Series B preferred stock and there were no outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock. We may also issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for common stock in connection with hiring or retaining employees, future acquisitions, future sales of our securities for capital raising purposes, or for other business purposes. The future issuance of any such additional shares of our common stock may create downward pressure on the trading price of the common stock. We may issue additional shares, warrants or other convertible securities in the future in conjunction with capital raising efforts, including at a price (or exercise price) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then currently traded on the OTC PINK.  Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal corporate office is located at 4400 Biscayne Blvd., Miami, Florida. We occupy this space from Frost Real Estate Holdings, LLC, which is a company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, one of our largest beneficial shareholders. We previously leased the approximately 1,800 square feet under a lease agreement, which commenced with a five-year term on January 1, 2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, and then we went on a month-to-month basis and then in February 2016 the office space rent was reduced to $0 per month. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nNone. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket for common stock\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC PINK under the symbol NIMU.OB. The table below sets forth, for the respective periods indicated, the high and low bid prices for the Companys common stock as reported by the OTC PINK. The following bid quotations represent inter-dealer prices, without adjustments for retail mark-ups, mark-downs or commissions and may not necessarily represent actual transactions.\nQuarter Ended High Low\nOctober 31, 2020 $ 0.06 $ 0.02\nJanuary 31, 2021 $ 0.05 $ 0.02\nApril 30, 2021 $ 0.07 $ 0.03\nJuly 31, 2021 $ 0.05 $ 0.02\nOctober 31, 2021 $ 0.04 $ 0.02\nJanuary 31, 2022 $ 0.04 $ 0.02\nApril 30, 2022 $ 0.03 $ 0.01\nJuly 31, 2022 $ 0.02 $ 0.01\nSince our inception, we have not paid any dividends on our common stock, and we do not anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable future. At July 31, 2022, we had 1,390 shareholders of record based on information provided by our transfer agent, Equity Stock Transfer. We believe that the actual number of beneficial shareholders is considerably higher. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include information otherwise required by this item. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements about our expectations, beliefs or intentions regarding, among other things, our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those set forth below as well as those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by applicable law. These forward-looking statements reflect our views only as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.\nOverview\nWe previously were engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of non-invasive, whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) therapeutic platforms, which are motorized platforms that move a subject repetitively head to foot. The Company discontinued operations in May 2019, accordingly, certain assets, liabilities and expenses are classified as discontinued operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies can be found in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates.\nResults of Operations\nWe have discontinued operations in May 2019. The Company is assessing potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations.\nYear Ended July 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended July 31, 2021\nGeneral and administrative costs and expenses. General and administrative (G&A) costs and expenses was $159,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022, as compared to $158,000 for the year ended July 31, 2021. This $1,000 net increase was primarily associated with professional fees incurred in the year ended July 31, 2022.\nTotal operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses from continuing operations was $159,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022, as compared to $158,000 for the year ended July 31, 2021. This $1,000 increase is primarily attributable to G&A noted above.\nInterest expense. Net interest expense was $14,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022, as compared to $0 for the year ended July 31, 2021. The interest expense is related to the Promissory Notes described in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNet loss. Net loss was $173,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022, as compared to $158,000 for the year ended July 31, 2021. This $15,000 increase is primarily attributable to interest expense as noted above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur operations have been primarily financed through private sales of our equity securities and advances under credit facilities previously available to us.\nAt July 31, 2022, we had cash of $15,000 and negative working capital of approximately $249,000. We expect that our existing funds will not be sufficient to support our current operations over the next twelve months. No assurance can be given that such additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Our ability to sell additional shares of our stock and/or borrow cash could be materially adversely affected by the economic uncertainty in the global equity and credit markets. Current economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile, and continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business and to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities.\nNet cash used in operating activities increased to $190,000 for the year ended July 31, 2022 as compared to $148,000 for the year ended July 31, 2021. This $42,000 increase was principally due to the increase in the operating loss offset by an increase in cash used by accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nOn October 4, 2021, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the Hsiao Note), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the Frost Gamma Note and Hsiao Note is 11% per annum, payable on the maturity date of October 4, 2023 (the Maturity Date). The Frost Gamma Note and Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nOn September 16, 2022, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the Frost Gamma Note 2), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the Hsiao Note 2), both which beneficially own in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date. The Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nThe Company plans include assessing potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. We will need to raise additional capital. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, we are not required to include the information otherwise required by this item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 274)\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at July 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareholders Deficit for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nNon-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in shareholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has experienced recurring net losses, cash outflows from operating activities, has an accumulated deficit and a substantial purchase commitment that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ EisnerAmper LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2018.\nEISNERAMPER LLP\nFort Lauderdale, FL\nOctober 28, 2022\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nJuly 31, 2022 July 31, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent assets\nCash $ 15 $ 55\nPrepaid expenses\nTotal current assets\nTotal assets $ 21 $ 59\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 219\n$ 248\nCurrent liabilities - discontinued operations\nTotal current liabilities\nNotes payable - related parties $ 150 $ -\nAccrued interest -\nTotal liabilities\nCommitments and Contingencies (Note 8) - -\nShareholders deficit\nSeries B Preferred Stock, par value $1.00 per share; 100 shares authorized, issued and outstanding; liquidation preference $10 - -\nCommon Stock, par value $0.01 per share; 400,000,000 shares authorized; 154,810,655 shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 1,548 1,548\nAdditional paid in capital 26,574 26,574\nAccumulated deficit (28,535 ) (28,362 )\nTotal shareholders deficit (413 ) (240 )\nTotal liabilities and shareholders deficit $ 21 $ 59\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYears ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nOperating costs and expenses\nGeneral and administrative $ 159 $ 158\nTotal operating costs and expenses\nOperating loss (159 ) (158 )\nInterest expense (14 ) -\nNet loss $ (173 ) $ (158 )\nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic and diluted $ 154,811 $ 154,811\nBasic and diluted loss per common share $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN SHAREHOLDERS DEFICIT\nYears ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except share amounts)\nPreferred Stock\nAdditional\nSeries B Common Stock Paid in Accumulated\nShares Amount Shares Amount Capital Deficit Total\nBalance at July 31, 2020 $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,204 ) $ (82 )\nNet loss - - - - - (158 ) (158 )\nBalance at July 31, 2021 - 154,810,655 1,548 26,574 (28,362 ) (240 )\nBalance - 154,810,655 1,548 26,574 (28,362 ) (240 )\nNet loss - - - - - (173 ) (173 )\nBalance at July 31, 2022 $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,535 ) $ (413 )\nBalance $ - 154,810,655 $ 1,548 $ 26,574 $ (28,535 ) $ (413 )\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYears ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\n(Dollars in thousands)\nOperating activities\nNet loss $ (173 ) $ (158 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities\nPrepaid expenses (2 ) (1 )\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (29 )\nAccrued interest -\nNet cash used in operating activities (190 ) (148 )\nFinancing activities\nProceeds from notes payable - related parties -\nNet cash provided by financing activities -\nNet decrease in cash (40 ) (148 )\nCash, beginning of year\nCash, end of year $ 15 $ 55\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nNON-INVASIVE MONITORING SYSTEMS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS\nOrganization. Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc., a Florida corporation (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company or NIMS). The Company previously developed and marketed its Exer-Rest\u00ae line of acceleration therapeutic platforms based upon unique, patented whole body periodic acceleration (WBPA) technology of which the Company maintains patents. The Company maintains limited administration, but does not have any operations or inventory.\nBusiness. The Company is currently a shell company (as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act).\nGoing Concern. The Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming it will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company had net losses from continuing operations of approximately $0.2 million for each of the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021 and has experienced cash outflows from operating activities. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of $28.5 million as of July 31, 2022. The Company had $15,000 of cash at July 31, 2022 and negative working capital of approximately $249,000. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn September 16, 2022, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the Frost Gamma Note 2), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the Hsiao Note 2), both which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date. The Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\nThe Company is seeking potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in this regard, and, if not successful, that it will be able to continue its business activities. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nDiscontinued Operations. On May 3, 2019 the Company exchanged inventory for forgiveness of accrued unpaid rent. The Company has no inventory, no immediate plans to replenish inventory and has no current plans to develop or market new products.\nAccordingly, the Company determined that the assets and liabilities met the discontinued operations criteria in Accounting Standards Codification 205-20-45 and were classified as discontinued operations at May 3, 2019. See Discontinued Operations Note 3.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems of Florida, Inc., which has no current operations, and NIMS of Canada, Inc., a Canadian corporation, which has no current operations. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nDiscontinued Operations. For the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, results from operations for our Exer-Rest Business are classified as discontinued operations. The carve out of the discontinued operations (i) were prepared in accordance with the SECs carve out rules under Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 1B1 and (ii) are derived from identifying and carving out the specific assets, liabilities, operating expenses and interest expense associated with the Exer-Rest Businesss operations (see Note 3).\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions, such as deferred taxes as estimates, that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments purchased with an original maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The Company had approximately $15,000 and $55,000, on deposit in bank operating accounts at July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.\nIncome Taxes. The Company provides for income taxes using an asset and liability based approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences in future years of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. The deferred tax asset for loss carryforwards and other potential future tax benefits has been fully offset by a valuation allowance since it is uncertain whether any future benefit will be realized. The utilization of the loss carryforward is limited to future taxable earnings of the Company and may be subject to severe limitations if the Company undergoes an ownership change pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code Section 382.\nThe Company files its tax returns as prescribed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which it operates. Tax years ranging from 2018 to 2022 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired. It is the Companys policy to include income tax interest and penalty expense in its tax provision.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments. Fair value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of July 31, 2022 and 2021. The respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments such as cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair values because they are short term in nature.\nNotes Payable. The carrying value of such financial instruments approximates their fair value since the stated interest rates approximates market rates for loans with similar terms for borrowers with similar credit profiles. The respective carrying value of the notes payable - related party approximate our current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity.\nLoss Contingencies. We recognize contingent losses that are both probable and estimable. In this context, we define probability as circumstances under which events are likely to occur. In regard to legal costs, we record such costs as incurred.\nRelated Parties.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company measures the cost of employee, officer and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of the Companys stock option awards is expensed over the vesting life of the underlying stock options using the graded vesting method, with each tranche of vesting options valued separately. The Company did not record any stock-based compensation during the twelve months ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIn November 2010, the Companys Board and Compensation Committee approved the Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2011 Plan). Awards granted under the 2011 Plan may have consisted of incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights (SAR), restricted stock grants, restricted stock units (RSU) performance shares, performance units or cash awards. Subject to adjustment in certain circumstances, the 2011 Plan authorized up to 4,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock for issuance pursuant to the terms of the 2011 Plan. The 2011 Plan was approved by our shareholders in March 2012 and the 2011 Plan expired in November 2020. No awards have been granted under the 2011 Plan as of July 31, 2022.\nAs of July 31, 2022, there were no outstanding stock options and there were no unrecognized costs related to outstanding stock options. As of July 31, 2022 the Company does not have an equity compensation plan.\n5. SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nThe Company has one class of Preferred Stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to vote with the holders of common stock as a single class on all matters. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 401,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of 400,000,000 shares of common stock and 1,000,000 designated shares of preferred stock with preferences and rights to be determined by our Board of Directors.\nSeries B Preferred Stock is not redeemable by the Company and has a liquidation value of $100 per share, plus declared and unpaid dividends, if any. Dividends are non-cumulative, and are at the rate of $10 per share, if declared.\nNo preferred stock dividends were declared for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company did not issue any shares of the Companys common stock during the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\n6. BASIC AND DILUTED LOSS PER SHARE\nBasic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed giving effect to all dilutive potential common shares that were outstanding during the period. Diluted potential common shares consist of incremental shares issuable upon conversion of preferred stock. In computing diluted net loss per share for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, no dilution adjustment has been made to the weighted average outstanding common shares because the assumed conversion of preferred stock would be anti-dilutive.\n7. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nDr. Hsiao, Dr. Frost and directors Steven Rubin and Rao Uppaluri are each stockholders, current or former officers and/or directors or former directors of Asensus Surgical, Inc. (formerly TransEnterix, Inc.) (Asensus), a publicly-traded medical device company. The Companys Chief Financial Officer also serves as the Chief Financial Officer and Co-Interim Chief Executive Officer of Cocrystal Pharma, Inc., a clinical stage Nasdaq listed biotechnology company, and in which Steve Rubin serves on the Board. From December 2009 until August 31, 2021, the Companys Chief Legal Officer had served under a cost sharing arrangement as the Chief Legal Officer of Asensus. The Company recorded additions to general and administrative costs and expenses to account for the sharing of costs under this arrangement of $400 and $4,800 for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Aggregate accounts payable to Asensus totaled approximately $0 and $400 at July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company signed a five year lease for administrative office space in Miami, Florida with a company controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost, who is the beneficial owner of more than 10% of the Companys common stock. The rental payments under the Miami office lease, which commenced January 1, 2008 and expired on December 31, 2012, were approximately $1,250 per month and then continued on a month-to-month basis. In February 2016 the rent was reduced to $0 per month. For the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not record any rent expense related to the Miami lease. At July 31, 2022 and 2021 there was $0 rent payable.\nThe Company is under common control with multiple entities and the existence of that control could result in operating results or financial position of each individual entity significantly different from those that would have been obtained if the entities were autonomous. One of those related parties, OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO) and the Company are under common control and OPKO has a one percent ownership interest in the Company that OPKO has accounted for as an equity method investment due to the ability to significantly influence the Company.\n8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLeases.\nThe Company was under an operating lease agreement for our corporate office space that expired in 2012. The lease currently continues on a month to month basis at no cost.\nProduct Development and Supply Agreement.\nIn September 2007, the Company entered into a Product Development and Supply Agreement (the Agreement) with Sing Lin Technologies Co. Ltd., a company based in Taichung, Taiwan (Sing Lin). Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company consigned to Sing Lin the development and design of the next generation Exer-Rest and related devices. The Agreement commenced as of September 3, 2007 and had a term that extended three years from the acceptance by NIMS of the first run of production units. Thereafter, the Agreement automatically renewed for successive one year terms unless either party sent the other a notice of non-renewal. Either party was permitted to terminate the Agreement with ninety days prior written notice. Upon termination, each partys obligations under the Agreement were to be limited to obligations related to confirmed orders placed prior to the termination date.\nPursuant to the Agreement, Sing Lin designed, developed and manufactured the tooling required to manufacture the acceleration therapeutic platforms for a total cost to the Company of $471,000. Sing Lin utilized the tooling in the performance of its production obligations under the Agreement. The Company paid Sing Lin $150,000 of the tooling cost upon execution of the Agreement and $150,000 upon the Companys approval of the product prototype concepts and designs. The balance of the final tooling cost became due and payable in September 2008 upon acceptance of the first units produced using the tooling, and was paid in full during the year ended July 31, 2009.\nUnder the now-terminated Agreement, the Company also granted Sing Lin the exclusive distribution rights for the products in certain countries in the Far East, including Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and certain other countries. Sing Lin agreed not to sell the Products outside its geographic areas in the Far East.\nThe Agreement provided for the Company to purchase approximately $2.6 million of Exer-Rest units within one year of the September 2008 acceptance of the final product. The Agreement further provided for the Company to purchase $4.1 million and $8.8 million of Exer-Rest products in the second and third years following such acceptance, respectively. These minimum purchase amounts were based upon 2007 product costs multiplied by volume commitments. Through July 31, 2022, the Company had paid Sing Lin $1.7 million in connection with orders placed through that date. As of July 31, 2022, the Company has approximately $41,000 of payables due to Sing Lin. As of July 31, 2022, aggregate minimum future purchases under the Agreement totaled approximately $13.9 million.\nAs of July 31, 2022, the Company had not placed orders sufficient to meet the purchase obligations under the Agreement. The Company notified Sing Lin in June 2010 that it was terminating the Agreement effective September 2010, and Sing Lin in July 2010 demanded that the Company place orders sufficient to fulfill the three year minimum purchase obligations in the Agreement. As of the date of this filing, Sing Lin has not followed up on its July 2010 demand. There can be no assurance that Sing Lin will not attempt to enforce its remedies under the Agreement, or pursue other potential remedies. The Company believes that Sing Lin in no longer in business.\n9. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses from continuing operations are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED EXPENSES\nJuly 31, 2022 July 31, 2021\nAccounts payable $ 203 $ 217\nAccrued redemption\nAccrued other\nTotal $ 219 $ 248\n10. INCOME TAXES\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Pursuant to this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of the Companys assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe accounting for uncertain tax positions guidance under ASC 740 requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The application of this guidance does not affect the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company files its tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and with U.S. states. The Company is subject to tax audits in all jurisdictions for which it files tax returns. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. There are currently no tax audits that have commenced with respect to income tax or any other returns in any jurisdiction. Tax years ranging from 2018 to 2022 remain open to examination by various taxing jurisdictions as the statute of limitations has not expired. Because the Company is carrying forward income tax attributes, such as net operating losses and tax credits from 2018 and earlier tax years, these attributes can still be audited when utilized on returns filed in the future. It is the Companys policy to include income tax interest and penalties expense in its tax provision.\nThe difference between income taxes at the statutory federal income tax rate of 21% in 2022 and 2021 and income taxes reported in the consolidated statements of operations are attributable to the following (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE AND INCOME TAXES\nJuly 31, 2022 % July 31, 2021 %\nIncome tax benefit at the federal statutory rate from continuing operations $ (36 ) 21.0 $ (33 ) 21.0\nState income taxes, net of effect of federal taxes (7 ) 4.3 (7 ) 4.3\nExpired net operating losses (164.3 ) (1.8 )\nChange in valuation allowance (239 ) 139.0 (23.5 )\nTotal $ - - $ - -\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets consist of the following (in thousands):\nSCHEDULE OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nJuly 31, 2022 July 31, 2021\nFederal and State net operating loss $ 4,081 $ 4,320\nForeign net operating loss\nOther\nDeferred tax assets gross,total 4,102 4,341\nLess: Valuation allowance (4,102 ) (4,341 )\nNet deferred tax asset $ - $ -\nAt July 31, 2022, the Company had available Federal and State net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $16.1 million and foreign net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $0.1 million which expire in various years beginning in 2023. Net operating loss carry forwards generated in 2019 and later years never expire. However, these net operating losses can only be used to reduce taxable income by 80 percent. The net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation due to change of ownership provisions under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and similar state provisions. The Company has not conducted a study to determine if any changes in ownership has occurred.\nA valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if, based on the weight of the evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that a full $4.1 million valuation allowance at July 31, 2022 ($4.3 million at July 31, 2021) was necessary. The valuation allowance decreased by $239,000 and increased by $26,000 for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company paid no taxes for the years 2022 or 2021.\n11. PROMISORY NOTES PAYABLE - RELATED PARTY\nOn October 4, 2021, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the Frost Gamma Note), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the Hsiao Note), both which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the Frost Gamma Note and Hsiao Note is 11% per annum, payable on the maturity date of October 4, 2023 (the Maturity Date). The Frost Gamma Note and Hsiao Note may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty.\n12. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn September 16, 2022, the Company entered into two Promissory Notes in the principal amount of $75,000 each with Frost Gamma Investments Trust (the Frost Gamma Note 2), a trust controlled by Dr. Phillip Frost and with Jane Hsiao, Ph.D., the Companys Chairman and Interim CEO (the Hsiao Note 2), both which beneficially owns in excess of 10% of NIMS common stock. The interest rate payable by NIMS on the Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 is 11% per annum, payable on the Maturity Date. The Frost Gamma Note 2 and Hsiao Note 2 may be prepaid in advance of the Maturity Date without penalty. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nThe Companys management, with the participation of its Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of July 31, 2022. Based upon that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of that date, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness identified below.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.\n1. Process and procedures - The internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nNotwithstanding the existence of these material weaknesses in the Companys internal control over financial reporting, the Companys management believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K fairly present in all material respects the Companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\nRemedial Actions to Address Material Weaknesses\nManagement has actively implemented an ongoing remediation plan to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated such that these controls will operate effectively. Consistent with the remediation plan we continue to conduct internal control training to address the lower levels of materiality in order to maintain internal control effectively against a material weakness as reported in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2022. This remains an ongoing process.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the last quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
