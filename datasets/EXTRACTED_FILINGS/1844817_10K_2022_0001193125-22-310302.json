    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nWe are a blank check company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as our initial business combination throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We disclosed in our final prospectus to our registration statement on Form S-1 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 16, 2021 (the final prospectus) that while we may pursue an initial business combination target in any business or industry, we intended to concentrate our efforts identifying businesses in the FinTech industry with an enterprise value of approximately $500 million to $1.0 billion, with particular emphasis on businesses that are providing digital, on-line or mobile payment solutions, processing and gateway services, point-of-sale technologies, consumer engagement platforms, and ecommerce and loyalty solutions.\nWe believe the creation, delivery and servicing of financial payment products and related services for consumers and businesses is undergoing continuous evolution, which will further and dramatically develop in the years ahead. Amid an increased level of sophistication in financial technology and services, we believe that there are many potential targets within the financial technology industry that could become attractive public companies, and that many other potential targets will continue to emerge. We believe that these potential targets exhibit a diverse range of business models and growth characteristics, ranging from high-growth companies to established firms with stable revenues and strong cash flow. In addition, these businesses tend to have above-industry growth rates and would greatly benefit from access to public market capital and managements extensive operational experience in both public and private companies. We believe our management team is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends and to identify, acquire, and manage a business in the financial technologies industry that can benefit from their operational, strategic, managerial and transaction experience, as well as their differentiated networks.\nWe are not, however, required to complete our initial business combination with a financial technologies business and, as a result, we may pursue a business combination outside of that industry. We will seek to acquire established businesses that we believe are fundamentally sound but potentially in need of financial, operational, strategic or managerial redirection to maximize value. We may also look at earlier stage companies that exhibit the potential to change the industries in which they participate and which will offer the potential of sustained high levels of revenue and earnings growth.\nRezolve Limited Business Combination Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021, we announced that we entered into a business combination agreement, dated as of December 17, 2021 with Rezolve Limited, a private limited liability company registered under the laws of England and Wales (Rezolve), and Rezolve Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Rezolve Merger Sub) and the other parties thereto, which we amended on November 10, 2022 (such business combination agreement, as amended, the Business Combination Agreement, and such business combination, the Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, Armada, Rezolve and Rezolve Merger Sub will effect a series of transactions including, among other things:\na company reorganization will be effected whereby (a) the A Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.0001 each of Rezolve shall be reclassified as Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.0001 each and all the then existing Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.0001 of Rezolve will be consolidated on a 10 to 1 basis into Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.001 each and (b) part of the amount standing to the credit of the share premium account of Rezolve shall be applied in paying up additional Ordinary Shares of \u00a30.001 each in Rezolve to be allocated to each of the existing shareholders on the basis of a ratio such that, together with any other necessary steps, immediately following all such steps each Company Shareholder will hold his, her or its applicable pro\nrata portion of the aggregate stock consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement (such steps in (a) and (b) and any additional necessary steps being collectively referred to as the Company Reorganization); and\nfollowing the Company Reorganization: (a) Rezolve Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Armada whereupon Rezolve Merger Sub will cease to exist and with Armada surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Rezolve; and (b) Armada shall loan all of its remaining cash in the Trust Account to Rezolve in exchange for a promissory note (the Promissory Note), to enable Rezolve to fund working capital and transaction expenses. Each of the outstanding shares of Armada Common Stock held by the shareholders of Armada will be exchanged for one Ordinary Share of Rezolve. As a result of the Company Reorganization and the Business Combination the shareholders of Rezolve will hold a number of Rezolve Ordinary Shares equal to (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $1,750,000,000 by (y) $10.00 minus (B) the Outstanding Warrant Number (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement).\nUpon the closing of the transactions, it is expected that the Combined Company will be named Rezolve PLC and will be listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.\nAmendment to Rezolve Limited Business Combination Agreement\nAs mentioned above, on November 10, 2022 (the Amendment Date), Armada and Rezolve entered into a First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment). Except as specifically set forth in the Amendment, all other terms and provisions of the Business Combination Agreement remain unaffected and continue in full force and effect. Below is a summary of the key amendments:\nStructure of the Business Combination\nThe Amendment amends the Business Combination Agreement so that Rezolve is substituted for Cayman Newco as applicable. As a result of this amendment, Cayman Newco is no longer a party to the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination, and Rezolve will be the listed entity upon the Closing. As necessary, Armada and Rezolve have agreed to make any amendments to the Ancillary Documents as are necessary or appropriate to effect the substitution of Rezolve for Cayman Newco in the Business Combination.\nTermination\nThe original Business Combination Agreement allowed the parties to terminate such agreement if certain conditions described therein are satisfied. One such condition allowed either Armada or Rezolve to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the Business Combination was not consummated by August 31, 2022 (the Termination Date). The Amendment extended the Termination Date to the later of (i) January 31, 2023 or (ii) fifteen (15) days prior to the last date on which Armada may consummate a Business Combination, as defined in and pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Armada, as approved or extended by the stockholders of Armada from time to time.\nThe original Business Combination Agreement allowed either Armada or Rezolve to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in the event the aggregate transaction proceeds provided or committed to be provided were not more than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). The Amendment deleted this provision in its entirety.\nIncentive Plan\nUnder the Amendment, Armada and Rezolve agreed and acknowledged that following June 30, 2023, the Board has the right to increase the number of shares under the Rezolve incentive plan by up to 5% per annum for each calendar year commencing in and including 2023, subject to appropriate shareholder approval as required by applicable law or the NASDAQ rules and regulations.\nArticles of Association\nPursuant to the Amendment, Armada and Rezolve agreed upon the form of the articles of association of Rezolve to be adopted and become effective upon closing of the Business Combination.\nThere are no assurances that the Business Combination will close, the consummation of which remains subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including, among others, a registration statement of Rezolve becoming effective and approval of the Business Combination by the stockholders of Armada and Rezolve.\nOur Management Team\nOur management team has significant operational experience working as executives and advisors in the financial technologies industry, particularly in the FinTech payments ecosystem. Our management team consists of seasoned leaders that have years of experience identifying and capitalizing on emerging technological and secular trends across the financial technologies industry, building and scaling high growth FinTech companies, a history of value creation in C-level operating roles in public companies, and delivering operational strategies designed to improve businesses over the long-term. Our management team is experienced in a variety of delivery models, including direct-to-consumer and business-to-business services as well as scalable networks, consumer engagement services, open platform technologies and robust ecosystems. Our management team is also well-versed in the regulatory and quasi-regulatory landscape that directly and indirectly impacts the financial technologies industry. In addition, our management team has significant transaction experience having executed and integrated numerous transactions in the financial technologies industry as operators and advisors. Messrs. Stephen P. Herbert and Douglas M. Lurio, our Chief Executive Officer and President, respectively, have worked together in the FinTech space for over 25 years. From 1996 to 2019, the two worked together at USA Technologies, Inc. (which changed its name to Cantaloupe Inc. on April 15, 2021, NASDAQ: CTLP), a publicly traded FinTech company (USAT), of which Mr. Herbert served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for eight years (and as an executive officer prior thereto) and Mr. Lurio served as outside general counsel for 29 years. While at USAT, the two were involved in the companys private and public funding of over $390 million, including public financings in excess of $100 million, as well as the companys acquisitions, including the companys nearly $90 million acquisition of Cantaloupe Systems, Inc. in November 2017. While Messrs. Herbert and Lurio worked together at USAT, the companys revenues grew from approximately $80,000 to approximately $170 million on an annualized basis, customer connections grew from 135 to 1.2 million, customers grew from approximately 135 to 20,000, annual transaction processing dollars grew from a nominal amount to $1.73 billion, the number of annual customer transactions increased from a nominal amount to nearly 890 million, recurring revenues on an annualized basis increased from a nominal amount to $140 million, and USAT attained its largest market cap of nearly $1 billion as of August 17, 2018.\nDuring his tenure at USAT, Mr. Herbert was recognized for his innovative leadership, including by Smart CEO, and as an EY Entrepreneur of the Year Finalist in the Greater Philadelphia area, and USAT received the following awards: Frost and Sullivan for Customer Value Leadership in the Integrated Financial Services and Retail Market, IoT Evolution Smart Machines Innovation, and a Deloitte Fast 500 Company. Previously, Mr. Herbert was employed by Pepsi-Cola, the beverage division of PepsiCo, Inc. (Nasdaq: PEP), and was a Manager of Market Strategy at Pepsi-Cola from 1994 to April 1996, responsible for directing development of market strategy for the vending channel, and subsequently, the supermarket channel for Pepsi-Cola in North America. Mr. Herbert resigned as Chief Executive Officer of USAT on October 17, 2019, and pursuant to his separation agreement was engaged as a consultant to serve as a resource for the incoming interim Chief Executive Officer for a one year period and was subject to a non-compete and a non-solicitation of clients, customers and employees during such one year period. Commencing in October 2020, Mr. Herbert has focused on the business of our Company as our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.\nAs a result of adjustments to previously reported revenues that were identified in connection with certain customer transactions, in February 2019, USAT determined to restate certain of its financial statements.\nSubsequent thereto, and during the audit and restatement process, additional adjustments related to financial reporting and accounting policy issues were identified which were unrelated to the foregoing adjustments. Based upon these additional adjustments, USAT determined to restate additional financial statements. Due to the foregoing, USAT was not able to file certain of its periodic reports within the time period required by Nasdaq, and USATs shares were suspended from trading on Nasdaq on September 26, 2019 and were subsequently relisted on Nasdaq. On October 9, 2019, USAT filed its outstanding periodic financial reports and announced that it had raised $20 million in an equity funding and obtained a commitment from the investor to extend a $30 million senior debt term loan facility. USAT has publicly disclosed that it has responded to a subpoena received from a regulatory agency that sought records regarding prior financial reporting periods, including the aforementioned restatements. USAT indicated that it is cooperating fully with the agencys requests.\nMr. Lurio is a former securities and corporate law partner of the Dilworth Paxson law firm and has been the founder and President of the Lurio & Associates, P.C. law firm since 1991 which specializes in corporate and securities law.

He has also served in senior leadership roles in a number of global organizations such as Cozen OConnor, Asbury Automotive, Inc., Unisource Worldwide, Inc. and Saint-Gobain Corporation.

He serves on the Board of Colorado UpLift, whose mission is to build long-term, life-changing relationships with urban youth, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also a member of the Bradley University Board of Trustees.\nWe believe that our management teams extensive relationships across the financial technologies industries, comprehensive operating experience building leading companies, transaction experience in acquiring and integrating businesses and focus on partnering with management teams to share our industry knowledge and network of long-standing industry relationships will enable us to consummate an initial business combination and facilitate innovative operational improvements and potential additional acquisitions post-close. Our collective experience in addressing complex situations across consumer- and business-facing business models involving a variety of revenue models and constituents, including the FinTech payment ecosystem and related consumer engagement platforms, and developing creative solutions forms the foundation of our competitive advantage.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the past performance of our management team is not a guarantee of either: (i) success with respect to any business combination we may consummate; or (ii) success with respect to any business combination we may consummate. No member of our management team has had management experience with any special purpose acquisition company in the past. You should not rely on the historical record of our management teams performance as indicative of future performance.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe have concentrated our efforts in identifying potential business combination targets in the FinTech industry with an equity value of approximately $500 million to $1.0 billion, with particular emphasis on businesses that provide digital, on-line or mobile payment solutions, processing and gateway services, point-of-sale technologies, consumer marketing platforms, and ecommerce and loyalty solutions.\nOver the past several years, there has been a rise in the level of sophistication and interconnectivity between innovative technology and financial services providers, and we expect this trend to continue and accelerate.\nThere has been significant disruption and change in the delivery of financial services in recent years, including, among others:\nRetail banking (mobile payments, Neo-Banks);\nPayments processing for consumers and businesses, including unattended Point of Sale payment systems;\nWealth management (robo advisors);\nDigital Marketing;\nExchanges and trading platforms;\nBig data moving to the cloud, APIs, data security; and\nDigital assets and blockchain technology.\nWith increased adoption of technology solutions by both consumers and businesses, we believe that the sector is poised for continued growth in both overall market size and penetration. Key industry characteristics include long-term organic growth, attractive competitive dynamics and further consolidation opportunities. Key business characteristics include high barriers to entry, low risk of technological obsolescence and public market-ready scale. Key financial metrics include organic revenue growth, recurring revenues and strong cash flow conversion.\nIn determining which potential business combination opportunities to pursue, our management considered a variety of factors in selecting potential business combination targets, including, but not limited to, the potential transaction size and enterprise value for the target relative to the size of our Trust Account; the industry in which the target operates, with a focus on those targets that fit within the acquisition criteria set forth in its final prospectus for our initial public offering in the digital, on-line or mobile payment solutions, processing and gateway services sectors, and/or with point-of-sale technologies, consumer marketing platforms, and e-commerce and loyalty solutions; and the public company readiness of the potential business combination targets, including the experience and composition of the management teams of the potential business combination targets.\nAcquisition / Investment Criteria\nAs discussed in our final prospectus, we identified the following general criteria that we believed were important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We used these criteria in evaluating our prospective Business Combination with Rezolve; however, no individual criterion was entirely determinative of our decision to pursue the prospective Business Combination with Rezolve:\nIs fundamentally sound and can unlock and enhance stockholder value through a combination with us, thereby offering attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders;\nIs at an inflection point, such as requiring additional management expertise, and able to accelerate growth and financial performance through differentiated business models and the addition of our operational, financial, transactional and legal expertise and networks;\nIs in need of a flexible, creative or opportunistic structure where we can deliver additional value;\nHas a strong, experienced management team, or provides a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability;\nCan benefit from being a publicly traded company, with access to broader capital markets, to achieve the business growth strategy;\nIs poised to grow both organically through the application of technology, as well as inorganically, through bolt-on or transformational acquisitions;\nHas a leading or niche market position and demonstrates advantages when compared to competitors, which may help to create barriers to entry against new competitors; and\nExhibits unrecognized value or other characteristics that we believe can be enhanced based on our analysis and due diligence review.\nWe believe we are offering the following benefits to Rezolve:\nPartnership with our management team members who have extensive and proven experience in operating, leading, advising and investing in market-leading financial services and FinTech companies;\nAccess to our deep and broad networks, insights and operational, financial, transactional, and legal and regulatory expertise;\nIncreased company profile and improved credibility with investors, customers, suppliers and other key stakeholders;\nHigher level of engagement with core, relevant, fundamental investors as anchor stockholders than what a traditional IPO book-building process offers;\nLower risk and expedited path to a public listing with flexible structuring;\nInfusion of cash and ongoing access to public capital markets;\nListed public currency for future acquisitions and growth;\nAbility for management team to retain control and focus on growing the business; and\nOpportunity to motivate and retain employees using stock-based compensation.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these criteria and guidelines were not intended to be exhaustive. Our evaluation relating to the merits of any particular business combination, including with Rezolve, included other considerations, factors, criteria and guidelines that our management deemed relevant.\nWe have until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering) to consummate an initial business combination after extending the period of time to consummate a business combination for three months on November 10, 2022 (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, our sponsor or its affiliates or designees deposited into the trust account $1,500,000, or $0.10 per share. On November 10, 2022, our sponsor loaned us $1.5 million in order to cover the additional contribution to the trust account in connection with the automatic extension of the deadline to complete our initial business combination and $0.45 million dollars for working capital purposes. Each loan is non-interest bearing and evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\nOur Acquisition Process\nIn evaluating a prospective target business, we conducted a thorough due diligence that encompassed, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, , as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us. We utilized our operational and capital allocation experience. While we were not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we elected not to do so.\nMembers of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private shares and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination\nif the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. On December 17, 2021, we announced that we entered into the Business Combination Agreement and on November 14, 2022, we announced that we entered into the Amendment. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.\nInitial Business Combination\nOur initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.\nEffecting a Business Combination\nRedemption Rights\nAt any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.\nOur sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to this offering or purchased by them in this offering or in the aftermarket.\nWe may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in street name, to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.\nThe proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed business combination will contain additional information regarding the applicable delivery requirements.\nAccordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in street name, in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to redeem their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.\nSince our anchor investors purchased all of the units that they collectively expressed an interest in purchasing in our initial public offering and are expected to vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination, no affirmative votes from other public stockholders are expected to be required to approve our initial business combination. However, because our anchor investors are not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing and are not obligated to vote any public shares in favor of our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that any of these anchor investors will be stockholders at the time our stockholders vote on our initial business combination, and, if they are stockholders, we cannot assure you as to how such anchor investors will vote on any business combination. We intend to give not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreement of our sponsor, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.\nAny request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.\nLiquidation if No Business Combination\nFollowing the automatic extension of the deadline to consummate our initial business combination pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation we will have only until February 17, 2023 (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) to complete an initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nOur sponsor, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders ability to redeem or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by February 17, 2023, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, executive officers, directors or any other person.\nUnder the Delaware General Corporation Law, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 15th month or if extended, 18th month, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.\nFurthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.\nBecause we will not be complying with Section 280 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, Section 281(b) of the Delaware General Corporation Law requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.\nWe are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after this offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will\nexecute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement entered into by our sponsor specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.\nWe anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after February 17, 2023, unless we see to further extend the deadline by which we may consummate our initial business combination. If we elect to liquidate, we anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $100,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private shares, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.\nOur public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the required time period, if the stockholders seek to have us redeem or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00 per share.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after February 17, 2023, unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination), this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from\nour assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. On November 10, 2022, we exercised the automatic extension of the deadline for us to complete an initial business combination under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and have until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering) to consummate a business combination. These provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders ability to redeem or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by February 17, 2023, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:\nwe shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;\nwe will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;\nif our initial business combination is not consummated by February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering), then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;\nupon the consummation of this offering, $150.0 million, or approximately $172.5 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, shall be placed into the trust account;\nwe may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and\nprior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in this offering on an initial business combination.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we encountered, and may continue to encounter, intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies.\nMany of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private shares, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.\nThe following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:\nour obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;\nour obligation to redeem or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and\nour outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.\nAny of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.\nIf we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.\nFacilities\nWe currently maintain our principal executive offices at 1760 Market Street, Suite 602, Philadelphia, PA 19103. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee to our sponsor. We will be charged for general and administrative services commencing on the date of this Annual Report pursuant to a letter agreement between us and our sponsor. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nEmployees\nWe have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.\nPeriodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements\nWe have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.\nWe will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.\nWe may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.\nLegal Proceedings\nThere is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our management team in their capacity as such. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K, before making a decision to invest in our securities. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below.\nSUMMARY OF RISK FACTORS\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks described below in this [Annual Report]. The following summary should not be considered an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing us, and it should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and the other information contained in this [Annual Report].\nOur public stockholders may be forced to wait after February 17, 2023 before receiving distributions from the trust account if we are unable to consummate a business combination.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination.\nWe may be unable to complete a business combination if our working capital is insufficient to allow us to operate through at least February 17, 2023 (unless we further extend the period of time).\nProvisions of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nWe depend upon the efforts of our key personnel to effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire.\nOur officers and directors have conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs, which could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.\nThe representative in our initial public offering may have a conflict of interest in rendering services to us in connection with our initial business combination.\nWe anticipate that we will only be able to complete one business combination and will be be solely dependent on a single business.\nThe redemption rights of our stockholders may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nEach public stockholder will have the option to vote in favor of a proposed business combination and still seek redemption of his, her or its shares.\nOur board of directors may exercise discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the business combination, which may result in a conflict of interest.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold, which may make it easier for us to consummate a business combination even where a substantial number of public stockholders seek to redeem their shares.\nOur current stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of shares in Rezolve as consideration in the business combination and minority share position may reduce the influence that our public stockholders have on the management of Rezolve following the business combination.\nWe may require stockholders who wish to redeem their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline.\nWe require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares to comply with specific requirements for redemption, and such redeeming stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nCompetition for attractive business combination targets could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\nWe may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time.\nThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets on the consummation of a business combination.\nSubsequent to the Closing, Rezolve may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nThe requirement that we complete an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination.\nThe extension of the time period to consummate our initial business combination for an additional three months without submitting such proposed extension to our stockholders for approval or offering our public stockholders redemption rights in connection therewith.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to.\nA business combination with a company located in a foreign jurisdiction would subject us to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations. and the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements impacting our ability to enforce our legal rights.\nWe will not be able to complete a business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards.\nPast performance by our management team or their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination that may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nCertain members of Rezolves management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce our sponsors indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.\nOur officers and directors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and may in the future become affiliated with other entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us.\nOur initial stockholders will control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote.\nThe value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share.\nOur anchor investors have purchased approximately 99% of the units sold in our initial public offering. As a result, the trading volume, volatility and liquidity for our shares could be reduced, the trading price of our shares could be adversely affected and other investors could be prevented from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nSince our anchor investors acquired an interest in founder shares from our sponsor in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nYou will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the underlying common stock or certain exemptions are available.\nOur managements ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nRezolve will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on Nasdaq, which it may not be able to do. Even if Rezolves securities are so listed, Rezolve may be unable to maintain the listing in the future.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\nThere may be tax consequences to our business combinations that may adversely affect us.\nA new 1% U.S. federal excise tax could be imposed on us in connection with redemptions by us of our shares.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants.\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nRisks Relating to our Search For, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks\nIf we are unable to consummate a business combination, our public stockholders may be forced to wait more than until February 17, 2023 before receiving distributions from the trust account.\nFollowing the exercise of the automatic extension of the deadline for us to complete an initial business combination under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering) to consummate a business combination unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). We have no obligation to return funds to investors prior to such date unless we consummate a business combination prior thereto and only then in cases where investors have sought to redeem or sell their shares to us. Only after the expiration of this full time period, which we may seek to extend further in accordance with our second amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation, will public security holders be entitled to distributions from the trust account if we are unable to complete a business combination. Accordingly, investors funds may be unavailable to them until after such date and to liquidate your investment, public security holders may be forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss.\nOur public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination.\nWe will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Annual Report. Accordingly, it is possible that we will consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of the business combination we consummate. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. For instance, Nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination. Therefore, if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than 20% of our outstanding shares, we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination instead of conducting a tender offer.\nIf we determine to change our acquisition criteria or guidelines, many of the disclosures contained in this Annual Report would not be applicable and you would be investing in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire.\nWe could seek to deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines disclosed in this Annual Report although we have no current intention to do so. Accordingly, investors may be making an investment in our company without any basis on which to evaluate the potential target business we may acquire. Regardless of whether or not we deviate from the acquisition criteria or guidelines in connection with any proposed business combination, investors will always be given the opportunity to redeem their shares or sell them to us in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination as described in this Annual Report.\nIf our working capital is insufficient to allow us to operate through at least February 17, 2023 (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination), we may be unable to complete a business combination.\nOn November 10, 2022, our sponsor loaned us $1.5 million in order to cover the additional contribution to the trust account in connection with the automatic extension of the deadline to complete our initial business combination and $0.45 million for working capital purposes. Also, as of September 30, 2022, we owed our Sponsor $251,754 for loans previously made to us in May 2022 to fund working capital. Each loan is non-interest bearing and evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. We believe that such funds will be sufficient to allow us to operate through February 17, 2023 (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination); however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Accordingly, if we use all of the funds held outside of the trust account and all interest available to us and the proceeds from our working capital loan made on November 10, 2022, we may not have sufficient funds available with which to close an initial business combination. In such event, we would need to borrow additional funds\nfrom our sponsor, officers or directors or their affiliates to operate or may be forced to liquidate. Our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount that they deem reasonable in their sole discretion for our working capital needs. Each loan would be non-interest bearing and be evidenced by a promissory note and would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest.\nA provision of our warrant agreement may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination.\nIf:\nwe issue additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock,\nthe aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and\nthe Market Value is below $9.20 per share,\nthen the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the price at which we issue the additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities. This may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial business combination with a target business.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel.\nOur ability to successfully effect a business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our key personnel, at least until we have consummated our initial business combination. We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain with us for the immediate or foreseeable future. In addition, none of our officers is required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, our officers will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have employment agreements with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our officers. The unexpected loss of the services of our key personnel could have a detrimental effect on us.\nThe role of our key personnel after a business combination, however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may serve in senior management or advisory positions following a business combination, it is likely that most, if not all, of the management of the target business will remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any such individuals, we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. Some or all of these individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements. This could be expensive and time-consuming and could lead to various regulatory issues which may adversely affect the operations of the post-business combination company.\nOur officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge regarding the jurisdiction or industry of the target business we may seek to acquire.\nWe may consummate a business combination with a target business in any geographic location or industry we choose. We cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have enough experience or have sufficient knowledge relating to the jurisdiction of the target or its industry to make an informed decision regarding a business combination.\nOur officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate a business combination.\nOur officers and directors will not commit their full time to our affairs. We presently expect each of our officers and directors to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of our initial business combination. The foregoing could have a negative impact on our ability to consummate our initial business combination.\nThe representative may have a conflict of interest in rendering services to us in connection with our initial business combination.\nWe have engaged the representative to assist us in connection with our initial business combination. We will pay the representative a cash fee for such services in an aggregate amount equal to up to 2.25% of the total gross proceeds raised in our initial public offering only if we consummate our initial business combination. We will also pay the representative a separate capital market advisory fee of $2,500,000 upon completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, we will pay the representative a cash fee equal to 1.0% of the total consideration payable in the proposed business combination if the representative introduces us to the target business with which we complete a business combination. These financial interests may result in the representative having a conflict of interest when providing the services to us in connection with an initial business combination.\nWe anticipate that we will only be able to complete one business combination, which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business.\nWe anticipate that we will consummate a business combination with a single target business, although we have the ability to simultaneously acquire several target businesses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be:\nsolely dependent upon the performance of a single business, or\ndependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nThis lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination.\nThe ability of our stockholders to exercise their redemption rights or sell their shares to us in a tender offer may not allow us to effectuate the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.\nIf our business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay the purchase price, because we will not know how many stockholders may exercise redemption rights or seek to sell their shares to us in a tender offer, we may either need to reserve part of the trust account for possible payment upon such redemption, or we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. In the event that the acquisition involves the issuance of our stock as consideration, we may be required to issue a higher percentage of our stock to make up for a shortfall in funds. Raising additional funds to cover any shortfall may involve dilutive equity financing or incurring indebtedness at higher than desirable levels. This may limit our ability to effectuate the most attractive business combination available to us, if we are able to consummate a business combination at all.\nIn connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder the option to vote in favor of a proposed business combination and still seek redemption of his, her or its shares.\nIn connection with any vote to approve a business combination, we will offer each public stockholder (but not our sponsor, officers or directors) the right to have his, her or its shares of common stock redeemed to cash (subject to the limitations described elsewhere in this Annual Report) regardless of whether such stockholder votes for or against such proposed business combination or does not vote at all. The ability to seek redemption while voting in favor of our proposed business combination may make it more likely that we will consummate a business combination.\nThe exercise by our board of directors of discretion in agreeing to changes or waivers in the terms of the business combination may result in a conflict of interest when determining whether such changes to the terms of the business combination or waivers of conditions are appropriate and in the best interests of our stockholders.\nIn the period leading up to the closing of the business combination, events may occur that, pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, would require us to agree to amend the Business Combination Agreement, to consent to certain actions taken by Rezolve, or to waive rights that we are entitled to under the Business Combination Agreement. Such events could arise because of changes in the course of Rezolves business, a request by Rezolve to undertake actions that would otherwise be prohibited by the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, or the occurrence of other events that would have a material adverse effect on Rezolves business and would entitle us to terminate the Business Combination Agreement. In fact, we announced that we entered into we entered into an amendment to the Business Combination Agreement. In any such circumstances, it would be at our discretion, acting through our board of directors, to grant its consent or waive those rights. The existence of the financial and personal interests of our officers and directors described in the preceding risk factors may result in a conflict of interest on the part of one or more of the directors between what they may believe is best for us and what we may believe is best for ourselves in determining whether or not to take the requested action.\nWe do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it easier for us to consummate a business combination even where a substantial number of public stockholders seek to redeem their shares to cash in connection with the vote on the business combination.\nWe have no specified percentage threshold for redemption in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. As a result, we may be able to consummate a business combination even though a substantial number of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their shares. However, in no event will we consummate an initial business combination unless we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of our initial business combination.\nOur current stockholders will experience immediate dilution as a consequence of the issuance of shares in Rezolve as consideration in the business combination. Having a minority share position may reduce the influence that our current stockholders have on the management of Rezolve following the business combination.\nAfter the business combination, assuming no redemptions of shares in Armada for cash and excluding any shares that may be issued pursuant to the Purchase Price Adjustment, our current public stockholders will own approximately 7.5% of Rezolve, our sponsor will own approximately 2.8% of Rezolve, our PIPE investors will own approximately 1% of Rezolve, and Rezolves existing shareholders (including its convertible noteholders) will own approximately 88.8% of Rezolve. The minority position of the former Armada stockholders will give them limited influence over the management and operations of Rezolve following the business combination.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to redeem their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights.\nIn connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, each public stockholder will have the right, regardless of whether he is voting for or against such proposed business combination or does not vote at all, to demand that we redeem his shares into a pro rata share of the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination. We may require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination. In order to obtain a physical stock certificate, a stockholders broker and/or clearing broker, DTC and our transfer agent will need to act to facilitate this request. It is our understanding that stockholders should generally allot at least two weeks to obtain physical certificates from the transfer agent. However, because we do not have any control over this process or over the brokers or DTC, it may take significantly longer than two weeks to obtain a physical stock certificate. While we have been advised that it takes a short time to deliver shares through the DWAC System, we cannot assure you of this fact. Accordingly, if it takes longer than we anticipate for stockholders to deliver their shares, stockholders who wish to redeem may be unable to meet the deadline for exercising their redemption rights and thus may be unable to redeem their shares.\nIf, in connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed business combination, we require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares to comply with specific requirements for redemption, such redeeming stockholders may be unable to sell their securities when they wish to in the event that the proposed business combination is not approved.\nIf we require public stockholders who wish to redeem their shares to comply with specific requirements for redemption and such proposed business combination is not consummated, we will promptly return such certificates to the tendering public stockholders. Accordingly, investors who attempted to redeem their shares in such a circumstance will be unable to sell their securities after the failed acquisition until we have returned their securities to them. The market price for our shares of common stock may decline during this time and you may not be able to sell your securities when you wish to, even while other stockholders that did not seek redemption may be able to sell their securities.\nBecause of our structure, other companies may have a competitive advantage and we may not be able to consummate an attractive business combination.\nWe expect to encounter intense competition from other than blank check companies having a business objective similar to ours and other entities, including venture capital funds, leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe that there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private shares, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, seeking stockholder approval or engaging in a tender offer in connection with any proposed business combination may delay the consummation of such a transaction. Additionally, our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of the foregoing may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination.\nAs the number of special purpose acquisition companies evaluating targets increases, attractive targets may become scarcer and there may be more competition for attractive targets. This could increase the cost of our initial business combination and could even result in our inability to find a target or to consummate an initial business combination.\nIn recent years and specifically in the last six months, the number of special purpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many potential targets for special purpose acquisition companies have already entered into an initial business combination, and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initial business combination, as well as many such companies currently in registration. As a result, at times, fewer attractive targets may be available, attractive targets under contract may nevertheless be approached by other potential acquirors, and it may require more time, more effort and more resources to identify a suitable target and to consummate an initial business combination.\nIn addition, because there are more special purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition for available targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause targets companies to demand improved financial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopolitical tensions, or increases in the cost of additional capital needed to close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicate or frustrate our ability to find and consummate an initial business combination, and may result in our inability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors altogether.\nChanges in the market for directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial business combination.\nIn recent months, the market for directors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. The premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms of such policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue.\nThe increased cost and decreased availability of directors and officers liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate an initial business combination. In order to obtain directors and officers liability insurance or modify its coverage as a result of becoming a public company, the post-business combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorable terms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors and officers liability insurance could have an adverse impact on the post-business combinations ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors.\nIn addition, even after we were to complete an initial business combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arising from conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial business combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers, the post-business combination entity would likely purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (run-off insurance). The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-business combination entity, and could interfere with or frustrate our ability to consummate an initial business combination on terms favorable to our investors.\nWe may issue our shares to investors in connection with our initial business combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time.\nIn connection with our initial business combination, we may issue shares to investors in private placement transactions (so-called PIPE transactions) at a price of $10.00 per share or which approximates the per-share amounts in our trust account at such time. The purpose of such issuances will be to enable us to provide sufficient liquidity to the post-business combination entity. The price of the shares we issue may therefore be less, and potentially significantly less, than the market price for our shares at such time.\nOur search for an initial business combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus surfaced in Wuhan, China and has spread throughout the world, including the United States. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. On January 31, 2020, the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary declared a public health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic. The COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected, and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) could adversely affect, the economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate an initial business combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete an initial business combination if concerns relating to COVID-19 continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target companys personnel, vendors and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for an initial business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. While vaccines for COVID-19 are being, and have been, developed, there is no guarantee that any such vaccine will be durable and effective consistent with current expectations and we expect that it will take significant time before the vaccines are available and accepted on a significant scale globally. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases) continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate an initial business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an initial business combination, may be materially adversely affected. Finally, the outbreak of COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this Risks Factors section, such as those related to the market for our securities and cross-border transactions.\nIn addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events (such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters or a significant outbreak of other infectious diseases), including as a result of increased market volatility, decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe determination for the offering price of our units is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities for an operating company in a particular industry.\nPrior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities. The public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the representative. Factors considered in determining the prices and terms of the units, including the shares of common stock and warrants underlying the units, include:\nthe history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies;\nprior offerings of those companies;\nour prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values;\nour capital structure;\nan assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies; and\ngeneral conditions of the securities markets at the time of the offering.\nHowever, although these factors were considered, the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities for an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results to compare them to.\nSubsequent to the Closing, Rezolve may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment, or other charges that could materially adversely affect its financial condition, results of operations and stock price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nWe cannot assure you that the due diligence we conducted on Rezolve revealed all material issues that may be present in Rezolve, that it would uncover all material issues through customary due diligence, or that factors outside of our and Rezolves control will not later arise. As a result, Rezolve may be forced to later write down or write off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses. Unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analyses. Even though these charges may be noncash items and not have an immediate impact on the liquidity of Rezolve, the incurrence of charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about Rezolve or its securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause Rezolve to be unable to obtain future financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nThe requirement that we complete an initial business combination within the prescribed period of time may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination.\nFollowing the automatic extension of the deadline, we have through February 17, 2023 to complete an initial business combination (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). Any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware of this requirement. Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination, knowing that if we do not complete a business combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete a business combination with any other target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the time limit referenced above.\nWe extended our time period to consummate our initial business combination for an additional three months and accordingly have a total of 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering to consummate a business combination without submitting such proposed extension to our stockholders for approval or offering our public stockholders redemption rights in connection therewith.\nWe exercised the automatic extension under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have until February 17, 2023 to consummate a business combination (for a total of 18 months from our initial public offering to complete a business combination) without submitting such proposed extension to our stockholders for approval or offering our public stockholders redemption rights in connection therewith. There are no assurances that we will be able to consummate our initial business combination during such period of time.\nWe may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nWe will only be required to obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire if it is an entity that is affiliated with any of our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates. In all other instances, we will have no obligation to obtain an opinion. Accordingly, investors will be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed business combination.\nResources could be spent researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nIt is anticipated that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting, and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents, and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to complete a\nspecific business combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached relating to a specific target business, we may fail to consummate the business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located in a foreign jurisdiction, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations.\nIf we consummate a business combination with a target business in a foreign country, we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in the target business home jurisdiction, including any of the following:\nrules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals;\ntariffs and trade barriers;\nregulations related to customs and import/export matters;\nlonger payment cycles;\ntax issues, such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the United States;\ncurrency fluctuations and exchange controls;\nchallenges in collecting accounts receivable;\ncultural and language differences;\nemployment regulations;\ncrime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks and wars; and\ndeterioration of political relations with the United States.\nWe cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.\nIf we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the United States, the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations. We cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction. The system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the United States. The inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business, business opportunities or capital. Additionally, if we acquire a company located outside of the United States, it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the United States and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors in the United States to enforce their legal rights, to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of United States courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws.\nBecause we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards, we will not be able to complete a business combination with prospective target businesses unless their financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards.\nThe federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical and/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, or international financial reporting standards, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with any tender offer documents we use, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. Additionally, to the extent we furnish our stockholders with financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS, such financial statements will need to be audited in accordance with U.S. GAAP at the time of the consummation of the business combination. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire.\nRisks Relating to Our Sponsor and Management Team\nPast performance by our management team or their affiliates may not be indicative of future performance of an investment in us.\nInformation regarding performance by, or businesses associated with, our management team or their affiliates, is presented for informational purposes only. Any past experience of and performance by our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee either: (1) that we will be able to successfully identify a suitable candidate for our initial business combination; or (2) of any results with respect to any initial business combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of our management team as indicative of the future performance of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward.\nOur key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following a business combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous.\nOur key personnel will be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements or other appropriate arrangements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. The personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business.\nCertain members of Resolves management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nOther than its chief executive officer, the members of Rezolves management team have limited experience managing a U.S. publicly-traded company, and most do not have experience interacting with public company investors and complying with the complex laws, rules and regulations that govern public companies. The management team in place following the business combination may not be able to successfully or efficiently manage Rezolves transition to being a public company.\nAs a public company, Rezolve will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Nasdaq rules. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that a company maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures (DCP) and internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR). The management teams limited experience operating a public company may result in operational inefficiencies or errors, or a failure to improve or maintain effective ICFR and DCP necessary to ensure timely and accurate reporting of operational and financial results. To date, Rezolves management team has not had to conduct a review of its DCP and ICFR for the purposes of such reporting requirements, and Rezolves management team will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives and may need to add personnel in areas such as accounting, financial reporting, investor relations and legal in connection with operations as a public company. Ensuring that Rezolve has adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place is a costly and time consuming effort that needs to be reevaluated frequently. Rezolves compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of managements time and attention.\nAdditionally, pursuant to Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404), Rezolve will be required to furnish certain certifications and reports by its management on its ICFR, which, after it is no longer an emerging growth company, must be accompanied by an attestation report on ICFR issued by its independent registered public accounting firm. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, Rezolve will document and evaluate its ICFR, which is both costly and challenging. Implementing any appropriate changes to its internal controls may require specific compliance training for Rezolves directors, officers and employees, entail substantial costs to modify its existing accounting systems, and take a significant period of time to complete. Such changes may not, however, be effective in maintaining the adequacy of its ICFR, and any failure to maintain that adequacy, or consequent inability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis, could increase its operating costs and could materially impair its ability to operate its business. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for Rezolve to produce reliable and timely financial reports and are important to help prevent fraud. Any failure by Rezolve to file its periodic reports in a timely manner may cause investors to lose confidence in its reported financial information and may lead to a decline in the price of its common stock.\nOur directors may decide not to enforce our sponsors indemnification obligations, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders.\nIn the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below $10.00 per public share and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce such indemnification obligations. It is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Additionally, each of our independent directors is a member of our sponsor. As a result, they may have a conflict of interest in determining whether to enforce our sponsors indemnification obligations. If our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.00 per share.\nOur officers and directors may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for a business combination.\nOur sponsor has waived its right to redeem its founder shares or any other shares purchased in this offering or thereafter, or to receive distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder shares upon our liquidation if we are unable to consummate a business combination. Accordingly, the shares acquired prior to this offering, as well as any private shares purchased by our officers or directors, will be worthless if we do not consummate a business combination. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a business combination and in determining whether the terms, conditions and timing of a particular business combination are appropriate and in our stockholders best interest.\nOur officers and directors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and may in the future become affiliated with other entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\nOur officers and directors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions and have obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial business combination. As a result, a potential target business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded the opportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business. Additionally, our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business, including another blank check company that may have acquisition objectives that are similar to ours. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to other entities prior to its presentation to us, subject to our officers and directors fiduciary duties under Delaware law. For a more detailed description of our officers and directors business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, see the sections titled Management - Directors and Executive Officers and Management - Conflicts of Interest.\nOur initial stockholders will control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a stockholder vote, in particular because our initial shareholders will own a higher interest in us than most other similarly structured blank check companies.\nUpon consummation of our initial public offering, our initial stockholders owned approximately 28% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock (assuming they and the anchor investors do not purchase any units in our initial public offering). This is different from most other offerings similar to ours where the founder shares represent less than 28% of all the issued and outstanding shares after the initial public offering, which may allow our initial stockholders to exert more control over us as more fully discussed below.\nOther than the anchor investors, none of our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units in our initial public offering or any units or shares of common stock in the open market or in private transactions. However, our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates could determine in the future to make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions, to the extent permitted by law, in order to influence the vote or magnitude of the number of stockholders seeking to tender their shares to us. In connection with any vote for a proposed business combination, our sponsor, as well as all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote the shares of common stock owned by them immediately before this offering as well as any shares of common stock acquired by them in this offering or in the aftermarket in favor of such proposed business combination. As a result, in addition to founder shares and private shares (assuming all of these shares are voted in favor of the transaction and that none of the sponsor and our officers or directors purchase any public shares in the offering or the aftermarket), we would need 5,547,000 of our public shares (or approximately 32.1% of our public shares) to be voted in favor of the transaction in order to have such transaction approved (assuming all outstanding shares are voted), or we would not need any public shares to be voted in favor of the transaction (assuming shares representing only a quorum are voted), and that the sponsor and our officers or directors do not purchase any public shares in the offering or the aftermarket). In addition, in the event that our anchor investors vote their public shares that they purchased in our initial public offering in favor of our initial business combination, no affirmative votes from other public stockholders would be required to approve our initial business combination. However, because our anchor investors are not obligated to continue owning any public shares following the closing of our initial public offering and are not obligated to vote any public shares in favor of our initial business combination, we cannot assure you that any of these anchor investors will be stockholders at the time our stockholders vote on our initial business combination, and, if they are stockholders, we cannot assure you as to how such anchor investors will vote on any business combination.\nOur board of directors is and will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. It is unlikely that there will be an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the consummation of a business combination, in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the consummation of the business combination. Accordingly, following the exercise of the automatic extension of the deadline for us to complete an initial business combination, stockholders will not be able to exercise voting rights under applicable corporate law for up to 18 months following our initial public offering. If there is an annual meeting, as a consequence of our staggered board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our sponsor, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regarding the outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the consummation of a business combination.\nRisks Relating to Our Securities\nThe value of the founder shares following completion of our initial business combination is likely to be substantially higher than the nominal price paid for them, even if the trading price of our common stock at such time is substantially less than $10.00 per share.\nAt the time of the closing of our initial public offering, our sponsor invested in us an aggregate of $4,631,400, comprised of the $36,400 purchase price for the founder shares and the $4,595,000 purchase price for the private shares. Assuming a trading price of $10.00 per share upon consummation of our initial business combination, the 5,087,500 founder shares would have an aggregate implied value of $50,875,000. Even if the trading price of our common stock was as low as $0.91 per share, the value of the founder shares would be equal to the sponsors initial investment in us. As a result, our sponsor is likely to be able to recoup its investment in us and make a substantial profit on that investment, even if our public shares have lost significant value. Accordingly, our management team, which owns interests in our sponsor, may have an economic incentive that differs from that of the public shareholders to pursue and consummate an initial business combination rather than to liquidate and to return all of the cash in the trust to the public shareholders, even if that business combination were with a riskier or less-established target business. For the foregoing reasons, you should consider our management teams financial incentive to complete an initial business combination when evaluating whether to redeem your shares prior to or in connection with the initial business combination.\nOur anchor investors have purchased approximately 99% of the units sold in our initial public offering. As a result , the trading volume, volatility and liquidity for our shares could be reduced, the trading price of our shares could be adversely affected and other investors could be prevented from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur anchor investors have purchased approximately 99% of the units in our initial public offering. The post-offering trading volume, volatility and liquidity of our securities may be reduced relative to what they would have been had the units been more widely offered and sold to other public investors. As a result, we may not be able to meet Nasdaqs continued listing standards. See - Nasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nSo long as our anchor investors hold a substantial portion of the units purchased, our sponsor and the anchor investors would collectively have substantial control over us and be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval (although we have no knowledge of any affiliation or other agreement or arrangement, as to voting of our securities or otherwise, among any such persons). For example, in the event that the anchor investors continue to hold the shares included in the units and vote such shares in favor of our initial business combination, we would not need any additional public shares sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination to have our initial business combination approved. Moreover, although the anchor investors are not contractually obligated to vote in favor of our business combination, their interest in our\nfounder shares may provide an incentive for them to do so. This potential concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other public stockholders, who may have interests that are different from those of our sponsor and the anchor investors. In addition, this potential significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with concentrated ownership, and might make it more difficult to complete a business combination with targets that would prefer to enter into a transaction with a SPAC with less concentrated ownership.\nSince our anchor investors acquired an interest in founder shares from our sponsor in connection with the closing of our initial public offering, a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate for our initial business combination.\nOur anchor investors purchased directly from our sponsor membership interests reflecting the allocation of certain founder shares to them, and paid only a nominal amount for those membership interests. Accordingly, the anchor investors will share in any appreciation in the value of the founder shares above that nominal amount, provided that we successfully complete a business combination. Moreover, as the anchor investors acquired all of the units in our initial public offering for a purchase price of $10.00 per unit and acquired an interest in 1,312,500 founder shares for a price of $0.006 per share, and assuming each warrant has no value and without taking into account any liquidity discount on the founder shares, the anchor investors will be paying an effective price of $9.19 per share of common stock acquired, as compared to the $10.00 per share to be paid by the other public stockholders in this offering. As a result, the anchor investors may have an incentive to vote any public shares they own in favor of a business combination, and, if a business combination is approved, they may make a substantial profit on such interest, even if the market price of our public securities declines in value below the price to the public in this offering and the business combination is not profitable for other public stockholders. In addition, as discussed above, if the anchor investors retain a substantial portion of their interests in our public shares and if the anchor investors vote those public shares in favor of a business combination, we will receive sufficient votes to approve the business combination, regardless of how any other public stockholder votes their shares. You should consider the anchor investors financial incentive to complete an initial business combination when evaluating whether to invest in our securities and/or redeem your shares prior to or in connection with an initial business combination.\nOur outstanding warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nWe issued warrants to purchase up to 7,500,000 shares of common stock as part of the units offered in our initial public offering. To the extent we issue shares of common stock to effect a business combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business. Such warrants, when exercised, will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete the business combination. Accordingly, our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. Additionally, the sale, or even the possibility of sale, of the shares underlying the warrants could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing. If and to the extent these warrants are exercised, you may experience dilution to your holdings.\nWe may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.\nWe have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, provided that the last reported sales price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period commencing at any time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to proper notice of such redemption provided that on the\ndate we give notice of redemption and during the entire period thereafter until the time we redeem the warrants, we have an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to them is available. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you (i) to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so, (ii) to sell your warrants at the then-current market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants.\nYou will not be permitted to exercise your warrants unless we register and qualify the underlying common stock or certain exemptions are available.\nIf the issuance of the shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants is not registered, qualified or exempt from registration or qualification under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws, holders of warrants will not be entitled to exercise such warrants and such warrants may have no value and expire worthless. In such event, holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the common stock included in the units.\nBecause the warrants will be exercisable until their expiration date of up to five years after the completion of our initial business combination, in order to comply with the requirements of Section 10(a)(3) of the Securities Act following the consummation of our initial business combination under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed that we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC as soon as practicable after the business combination either a post-effective amendment to our registration statement containing the final prospectus for our initial public offering or a new registration statement covering the registration under the Securities Act of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective within 90 business days following our initial business combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order.\nIf the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the Securities Act, under the terms of the warrant agreement, holders of warrants who seek to exercise their warrants will not be permitted to do so for cash and, instead, will be required to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption.\nIn no event will warrants be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration or qualification is available.\nIn no event will we be required to net cash settle any warrant, or issue securities (other than upon a cashless exercise as described above) or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws.\nOur managements ability to require holders of our warrants to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis will cause holders to receive fewer shares of common stock upon their exercise of the warrants than they would have received had they been able to exercise their warrants for cash.\nIf we call our public warrants for redemption after the redemption criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report have been satisfied, our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his warrant to do so on a cashless basis. If our management chooses to require holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis, the number of shares of common stock received by a holder upon exercise will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. This will have the effect of reducing the potential upside of the holders investment in our company.\nIf our security holders exercise their registration rights, it may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares of common stock and the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effect a business combination.\nThe holders of the founder shares are entitled to make a demand that we register the resale of the founder shares at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which their shares may be released from escrow. Additionally, the holders of the private shares and any shares of common stock our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us, are entitled to demand that we register the resale of the private shares and any other shares of common stock we issue to them commencing at any time after we consummate an initial business combination. The presence of these additional securities trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities. In addition, the existence of these rights may make it more difficult to effectuate a business combination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business, as the stockholders of the target business may be discouraged from entering into a business combination with us or will request a higher price for their securities because of the potential effect the exercise of such rights may have on the trading market for our shares of common stock.\nNasdaq may delist our securities from quotation on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.\nWe cannot assure you that our securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq in the future prior to an initial business combination. Additionally, in connection with our initial business combination, it is likely that Nasdaq will require us to file a new initial listing application and meet its initial listing requirements as opposed to its more lenient continued listing requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time. Nasdaq will also have discretionary authority to not approve our listing if Nasdaq determines that the listing of the company to be acquired is against public policy at that time.\nIf Nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange, or we are not listed in connection with our initial business combination, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\na determination that our shares of common stock are penny stock which will require brokers trading in our shares of common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our shares of common stock;\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for our company; and\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nThe National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our units, common stock and warrants are be listed on Nasdaq, our units, common stock and warrants are covered\nsecurities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities.\nRezolve will be required to meet the initial listing requirements to be listed on Nasdaq, which it may not be able to do. Even if Rezolves securities are so listed, Rezolve may be unable to maintain the listing in the future.\nIf, following the business combination, Rezolve fails to meet the initial listing requirements and Nasdaq does not list its securities on its exchange, Rezolve could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\na limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for Rezolve; and\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nAny of the foregoing could materially adversely affect Rezolves financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nYou will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of blank check companies.\nSince the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private shares are intended to be used to complete a business combination with a target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the United States securities laws. However, since we had net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful consummation of our initial public offering and the sale of the private shares and filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors of blank check companies such as Rule 419. Accordingly, investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules which would, for example, completely restrict the transferability of our securities, require us to complete a business combination within 18 months of the effective date of the initial registration statement and restrict the use of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account. Because we are not subject to Rule 419, our units were immediately tradable and we are entitled to withdraw amounts from the funds held in the trust account prior to the completion of a business combination. For a more detailed comparison of our initial public offering to offerings that comply with Rule 419, please see Proposed Business - Comparison to offerings of blank check companies subject to Rule 419.\nThere may be tax consequences to our business combinations that may adversely affect us.\nWhile we expect to undertake any merger or acquisition so as to minimize taxes both to the acquired business and/or asset and us, such business combination might not meet the statutory requirements of a tax-free reorganization, or the parties might not obtain the intended tax-free treatment upon a transfer of shares or assets. A non-qualifying reorganization could result in the imposition of substantial taxes.\nA new 1% U.S. federal excise tax could be imposed on us in connection with redemptions by us of our shares.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act), which, among other things, imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by a domestic corporation beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the Excise Tax). The U.S.\nDepartment of Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the Excise Tax; however, no guidance has been issued to date. Because we are a Delaware corporation and our securities trade on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, we believe we are a covered corporation within the meaning of the Inflation Reduction Act, and while not free from doubt, it is possible that the Excise Tax will apply to any redemptions of our common stock effectuated after December 31, 2022, including redemptions in connection with an initial business combination and any amendment to our certificate of incorporation to extend the time to consummate an initial business combination, unless an exemption is available or the fair market value of stock repurchased or redeemed is offset by other equity issuances occurring within the same taxable year of such redemptions. Consequently, the value of your investment in our securities may be affected as a result of the Excise Tax. Further, the application of the Excise Tax in the event of a liquidation is uncertain absent further guidance. We believe that pursuant to both the existing charter and the Trust Agreement, the Company may pay for the Excise Tax from any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will only be able to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis.\nIf we do not file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants at the time that holders wish to exercise such warrants, they will only be able to exercise them on a cashless basis provided that an exemption from registration is available. As a result, the number of shares of common stock that holders will receive upon exercise of the warrants will be fewer than it would have been had such holder exercised his warrant for cash. Further, if an exemption from registration is not available, holders would not be able to exercise on a cashless basis and would only be able to exercise their warrants for cash if a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is available. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, we have agreed to use our best efforts to meet these conditions and to file and maintain a current and effective prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so. If we are unable to do so, the potential upside of the holders investment in our company may be reduced or the warrants may expire worthless.\nAn investor will only be able to exercise a warrant if the issuance of shares of common stock upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or is deemed exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants.\nNo warrants will be exercisable and we will not be obligated to issue shares of common stock unless the shares of common stock issuable upon such exercise has been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the holder of the warrants. If the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders of the warrants reside, the warrants may be deprived of any value, the market for the warrants may be limited and they may expire worthless if they cannot be sold.\nWe may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants.\nOur warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement will provide that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision. The warrant agreement requires the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nOur warrant agreement designates the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company.\nOur warrant agreement provides that, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement, including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, these provisions of the warrant agreement do not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement.\nIf any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope of the forum provisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (a foreign action) in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall be deemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions (an enforcement action), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holders counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.\nThis choice-of-forum provision may limit a warrant holders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors.\nIf third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in trust could be reduced and the per-share redemption price received by stockholders may be less than $10.00.\nOur placing of funds in trust may not protect those funds from third party claims against us. Although we will seek to have all vendors and service providers we engage and prospective target businesses we negotiate with execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, they may not execute such agreements. Furthermore, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they may seek recourse against the trust account. A court may not uphold the validity of such agreements. Accordingly, the proceeds held in trust could be subject to claims which could take priority over those of our public stockholders. If we are unable to complete a business combination and distribute the proceeds held in trust to our public stockholders, our sponsor has agreed (subject to certain exceptions described elsewhere in this Annual Report) that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsors only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. As a result, the per-share distribution from the trust account may be less than $10.00, plus interest, due to such claims.\nAdditionally, if we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we may not be able to return to our public stockholders at least $10.00.\nOur stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them.\nFollowing the exercise of the automatic extension of the deadline for us to complete an initial business combination under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering) to consummate a business combination (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination). If we have not completed a business combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of the date of distribution. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that third parties will not seek to recover from our stockholders amounts owed to them by us.\nIf we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance. As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly after expiration of the time we have to complete an initial business combination, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock or debt securities to complete a business combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $.0001 per share. Immediately after our initial public offering and the purchase of the private shares, there were 71,790,500 authorized but unissued shares of common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for the issuance of the shares underlying the public warrants. Immediately after the consummation of our initial public offering, there were no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. Although we have no commitment as of the date of this Annual Report, we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock or shares of preferred stock, or a combination of common stock and preferred stock, to complete a business combination. The issuance of additional shares of common stock will not reduce the per-share redemption amount in the trust account. The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock:\nmay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors in our initial public offering;\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock;\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our shares of common stock.\nSimilarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in:\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding.\nIf we incur indebtedness, our lenders will not have a claim on the cash in the trust account and such indebtedness will not decrease the per-share redemption amount in the trust account.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock and could entrench management.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will contain provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. Our board of directors will be divided into three classes, each of which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. As a result, at a given annual meeting only a minority of the board of directors may be considered for election. Since our staggered board may prevent our stockholders from replacing a majority of our board of directors at any given annual meeting, it may entrench management and discourage unsolicited stockholder proposals that may be in the best interests of stockholders. Moreover, our board of directors has the ability to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock. We are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under Delaware law, which could delay or prevent a change of control. Together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that derivative actions brought in our name, actions against directors, officers and employees for breach of fiduciary duty and other similar actions may be brought only in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware, except any action (A) as to which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten days following such determination), (B) which is vested in the exclusive jurisdiction of a court or forum other than the Court of Chancery, or (C) for which the Court of Chancery does not have subject matter jurisdiction. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims, although our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder and may therefore bring a claim in another appropriate forum. We cannot be certain that a court will decide that this provision is either applicable or enforceable, and if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the exclusive forum provision will be applicable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. In addition, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to actions brought under the Securities Act, or the rules and regulations thereunder.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are a newly formed company with no operating history and, accordingly, you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nWe are a newly formed company with no operating results to date. Since we do not have an operating history, you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective, which is to acquire an operating business. We have not conducted any substantive discussions and we have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective acquisition candidates. We will not generate any revenues until, at the earliest, after the consummation of a business combination.\nOur independent registered public accounting firms report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash of $177,578 and a working capital deficit of $3,149,327. Further, we expect to incur significant costs in pursuit of financing plans and our initial business combination. Managements plans to address this need for capital are discussed in the section of this Annual Report titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete a business combination.\nA company that, among other things, is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, trading or holding certain types of securities would be deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Since we will invest the proceeds held in the trust account, it is possible that we could be deemed an investment company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in trust may be invested by the trustee only in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act.\nIf we are nevertheless deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be subject to certain restrictions that may make it more difficult for us to complete a business combination, including:\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments; and\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities.\nIn addition, we may have imposed upon us certain burdensome requirements, including:\nregistration as an investment company;\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy, compliance policies and procedures and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nCompliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense for which we have not allotted.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are an emerging growth company and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our shareholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any March 31 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following September 30. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a\nSecurities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior March 31, or (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior March 31. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nCompliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 will require substantial financial and management resources and may increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls and, if we cease to qualify as a smaller reporting company, will require that we have such system of internal controls audited beginning with our next Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penalties and/or stockholder litigation. Any inability to provide reliable financial reports could harm our business. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires that our independent registered public accounting firm report on managements evaluation of our system of internal controls. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition. Furthermore, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in the implementation of adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe maintain our executive offices at 1760 Market Street, Suite 602, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. ITEM 3.

On November 16, 2021, our Common Stock and Warrants began trading on Nasdaq under the symbols AACI and AACIW, respectively. Each Unit consists of one share of Common Stock and one half of one Redeemable Warrant. Each warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of Common Stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as described in our final prospectus dated August 12, 2021 which was filed with the SEC on August 16, 2021.

The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination. The payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future.

I.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on November 5, 2020, for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses.\nOn August 17, 2021, we consummated our IPO of 15,000,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $150 million.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of 459,500 Private Shares for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,000.\nUpon the closing of the IPO on August 17, 2021, $150,000,000 ($10.00 per unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO and the sale of Private Shares were placed in the Trust Account.\nIf we are unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us but net of taxes payable (and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nBusiness Combination Agreement\nOn December 17, 2021, we announced that we entered into a business combination agreement, dated as of December 17, 2021, with Rezolve Limited, a private limited liability company registered under the laws of England and Wales (Rezolve), Rezolve Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (Cayman NewCo), and Rezolve Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Rezolve Merger Sub) (such business combination agreement, the Business Combination Agreement, and such business combination, the Business Combination).\nPursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement, we, Cayman NewCo, Rezolve and Rezolve Merger Sub will effect a series of transactions including, among other things:\na company reorganization pursuant to which Cayman NewCo will enter into a transfer and exchange agreement (the Transfer and Exchange Agreement), pursuant to which, each Key Company Shareholder (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) will transfer to Cayman NewCo his, her or its respective shares of Rezolve in exchange for ordinary shares in Cayman NewCo, such that following the effectiveness of such transfers, the Key Company Shareholders will own the same proportionate equity interests of Cayman NewCo that such Key Company Shareholders owned immediately before such transfers (with the balance of the other shares of Rezolve to be transferred to Cayman NewCo in exchange for an equivalent number and class of shares in Cayman NewCo) and, immediately thereafter, each Key Company Shareholder will transfer to Cayman NewCo all of his, her or its respective shares of Cayman NewCo so received in exchange for his, her or its applicable pro rata portion of the aggregate stock consideration in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Business Combination Agreement and in such Transfer and Exchange Agreement (with all other shareholders of Rezolve to transfer to Cayman NewCo all of his, her or its respective shares of Cayman NewCo received in exchange for his, her or its applicable pro rata portion of the aggregate stock consideration); and\nfollowing the Company Reorganization, but in no event earlier than ten (10) days following the effectiveness of each of the transactions contemplated by the Company Reorganization: (a) Rezolve Merger Sub shall be merged with and into Armada whereupon Rezolve Merger Sub will cease to exist and with Armada surviving the Merger as a subsidiary of Cayman NewCo; and (b) Armada shall loan all of its remaining cash in the Trust Account to Cayman NewCo in exchange for a promissory note, to enable Cayman NewCo to fund working capital and transaction expenses. Pursuant to the Merger, all of the outstanding securities of Armada will be converted into the right to receive an equivalent number of securities of Cayman NewCo of the same type and with the same terms.\nAs a result of the Business Combination (i) the shareholders of Rezolve will receive a number of Cayman NewCo ordinary shares equal to (A) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $1,750,000,000 by (y) $10.00 minus (B) the Outstanding Warrant Number (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) and minus (C) the Acquisition Shares (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) (to the extent such Acquisition Shares are not already issued on or prior to the Company Reorganization Date), and (ii) the combined company will pay or cause to be paid all of the transaction expenses.\nThe consummation of the Business Combination is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions of the respective parties, including the completion of the Company Reorganization, the requisite approvals of our stockholders and Rezolves shareholders and regulatory approvals.\nIn connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, we and Cayman NewCo entered into certain subscription agreements, each dated December 17, 2021 (the Subscription Agreements), with certain investors, pursuant to which such investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 2,050,000 Ordinary Shares (the PIPE Shares) of Cayman NewCo (together, the Subscriptions), for a purchase price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.5 million to be issued substantially concurrently with the consummation\nof the Business Combination. The obligations of each party to consummate the Subscriptions are conditioned upon, among other things, customary closing conditions.\nOn November 10, 2022 (the Amendment Date), Armada and Rezolve entered into a First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment). Except as specifically set forth in the Amendment, all other terms and provisions of the original Business Combination Agreement remain unaffected and continue in full force and effect. Below is a summary of the key amendments:\nStructure of the Business Combination\nThe Amendment amends the Business Combination Agreement so that Rezolve is substituted for Cayman Newco as applicable. As a result of this amendment, Cayman Newco is no longer a party to the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination, and Rezolve will be the listed entity upon the closing. As necessary, Armada and Rezolve have agreed to make any amendments to the Ancillary Documents as are necessary or appropriate to effect the substitution of Rezolve for Cayman Newco in the Business Combination.\nTermination\nThe original Business Combination Agreement allowed the parties to terminate such agreement if certain conditions described therein are satisfied. One such condition allowed either Armada or Rezolve to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the Business Combination is not consummated by August 31, 2022 (the Termination Date). The Amendment extended the Termination Date to the later of (i) January 31, 2023 or (ii) fifteen (15) days prior to the last date on which Armada may consummate a Business Combination, as defined in and pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Armada, as approved or extended by the stockholders of Armada from time to time.\nThe original Business Combination Agreement allowed either Armada or Rezolve to terminate the Business Combination Agreement in the event the aggregate transaction proceeds provided or committed to be provided are not more than fifty million dollars ($50,000,000). The Amendment deleted this provision in its entirety.\nIncentive Plan\nUnder the Amendment, Armada and Rezolve agreed and acknowledged that following June 30, 2023, the Board has the right to increase the number of Rezolve shares under the Rezolve Incentive Plan by up to 5% per annum for each calendar year commencing in and including 2023, subject to appropriate shareholder approval as required by applicable law or the NASDAQ rules and regulations.\nArticles of Association\nPursuant to the Amendment, Armada and Rezolve agreed upon the form of the articles of association of Rezolve to be adopted and become effective upon closing of the Business Combination.\nWe cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful.\nResults of Operations\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $3,622,794, which consisted of formation and operating costs of $4,391,263, stock-based compensation of $111,852, and income tax provision of $145,621, partially offset by trust interest income of $1,025,942.\nFor the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $468,899, which consisted of formation and operating costs of $184,105 and stock-based compensation of $285,846, partially offset by trust interest income of $1,052.\nFollowing the exercise of the automatic extension of the deadline for us to complete an initial business combination under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we have until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering) to consummate a business combination (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) (the Combination Period) . However, if we are unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period (unless such period is further extended pursuant to the approval of our stockholders), we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company but net of taxes payable (and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. As of September 30, 2022, the Trust Account has released $182,069 to the Company to pay tax obligations.\nWe have also agreed to reimburse the Sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, the Company paid $120,000 and $20,000 under this agreement, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had cash outside our Trust Account of $177,578, available for working capital needs. All remaining cash was held in the Trust Account and is generally unavailable for our use, prior to an initial business combination.\nOn August 17, 2021, we completed the sale of 15,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $150,000,000.\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of 459,500 shares of common stock (Private Shares), at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,000.\nIn connection with the IPO, the underwriters were granted a 45-day option from the date of the prospectus for the IPO to purchase up to 2,250,000 additional units to cover over-allotments, if any. On October 1, 2021 this option expired unused.\nFollowing our IPO and the sale of the Private Shares, a total of $150,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) was placed in the Trust Account. We incurred $3,537,515 in IPO related costs, including $1,500,000 of underwriting fees and $2,037,515 of other costs.\nOn May 9, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company the aggregate amount of $483,034 in order to assist the Company to fund its working capital needs. The loan is evidenced by two promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $483,034 from the Company, as maker, to the Sponsor, as payee. The promissory notes are non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of: (i) the liquidation or release of all of the monies held in the Trust Account or (ii) the date on which the Company consummates an acquisition, merger or other business combination transaction involving the Company or its affiliates. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time. During July 2022, the Company fully repaid one of the promissory notes in the amount of $187,034 which\nrepresented monies loaned to the Company for the payment of Delaware franchise taxes. The Company utilized the interest earned on the Trust Account to repay the promissory note, $120,000 of which was distributed to it from the Trust Account during June 2022, and $62,069 of which was distributed to it from the Trust Account during July 2022. The Company also paid $44,246 on behalf of the Sponsor for tax services in August and September 2022, resulting in $251,754 balance outstanding under the second promissory note as of September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had investment held in the Trust Account of $150,844,925. The investment held in the Trust Account was held in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less and in money market funds which invest in U.S. Treasury securities. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. As of September 30, 2022, the Trust Account has released $182,069 to the Company to pay franchise tax obligations.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $913,835. Net loss of $3,622,794 was impacted primarily by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $3,623,049, stock-based compensation of $111,852, partially offset by trust interest income of $1,025,942.\nWe intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account to complete our initial business combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes and liquidation expenses if we are unsuccessful in completing a business combination. We estimate our annual franchise tax obligations to be $200,000, which is the maximum amount of annual franchise taxes payable by us as a Delaware corporation per annum, which we may pay from funds held outside of the Trust Account or from interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and released to us for this purpose. Our 2021 Delaware franchise tax amounted to $182,069. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account reduced by our operating expenses and franchise taxes. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the Trust Account will be sufficient to pay our income taxes. To the extent that our equity or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2022, the Trust Account has released $182,069 to the Company to pay tax obligations.\nFurther, our sponsor, officers and directors or their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required . If we complete a business combination, we would repay the loans. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the loans, but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the loans. Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes and would be repaid upon consummation of a business combination, without interest. As of September 30, 2022, there was a balance due to the Sponsor of $251,754 under the loans.\nIn connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, our management has determined that we have and will continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of acquisition plans which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should we be required to liquidate after February 17, 2023. The financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business for the 18 month period from the closing of our initial public offering (or until February 17, 2023). On November 10, 2022, our Sponsor loaned us $1.5 million in order to cover the additional contribution to the trust account required in connection with the automatic extension of the deadline to complete our initial business combination and $0.45 million dollars for working capital purposes. However, if our estimates of the operating\ncosts are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Under the original Business Combination Agreement, either we or Rezolve could have terminated the Business Combination Agreement if the aggregate transaction proceeds (excluding certain amounts invested by the investors specified in the Business Combination Agreement) provided or committed to be provided was not more than $50 million. The Amendment entered into in November 2022 eliminated this provision in its entirety. If we are unable to complete a business combination (including the Business Combination) because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the Trust Account.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:\nCommon Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock are classified as stockholders equity. The Companys shares of common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, 15,000,000 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the remeasurement adjustment from initial carrying amount to redemption book value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable common stock resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital.\nNet Loss Per Common Stock\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net loss per common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Remeasurement adjustments associated with the redeemable shares of common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nThe calculation of diluted loss per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the IPO because the warrants are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common stock is the same as basic net loss per common stock for the periods presented.\nAccretion of the carrying value of common stock subject to redemption value is excluded from net loss per common stock because the redemption value approximates fair value.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nWe have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.\nWe have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets.\nContractual Obligations\nWe do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities other than an administrative agreement to reimburse our sponsor for office space, secretarial and administrative services not to exceed $10,000 per month from the date of closing of the Public Offering. Upon completion of a business combination or the Companys liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees.\nFinancial Advisory Fee\nWe engaged Cohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC (CCM), an affiliate of a member of the Sponsor, to provide consulting and advisory services in connection with the IPO, for which it received an advisory fee equal to one (1.0) percent of the aggregate proceeds of the IPO, or $1,500,000, upon closing of the IPO. Affiliates of CCM have and manage investment vehicles with a passive investment in the Sponsor. On August 18, 2021, we paid to CCM an aggregate of $1,500,000. CCM has agreed to defer the payment of the portion of the advisory fee attributable to over-allotment option until the consummation of the initial Business Combination. CCM is engaged to represent our interests only. We have also engaged CCM as an advisor in connection with the initial Business Combination for which it will earn an advisory fee of 2.25% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $3,375,000, payable at closing of the Business Combination. On October 1, 2021 the underwriters over-allotment option expired unused resulting in no additional fees and commissions related to the over-allotment option to be not payable to CCM by the Company.\nBusiness Combination Marketing Agreement\nWe engaged the representative of the underwriter as an advisor in connection with Business Combination to assist in holding meetings with our stockholders to discuss the potential Business Combination and the target business attributes, introduce us to potential investors that are interested in purchasing our securities in connection with the initial Business Combination and assist us with press releases and public filings in connection with the Business Combination. We will pay the representative a cash fee for such services upon the consummation of the initial Business Combination in an amount equal to 2.25% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $3,375,000. We will also pay the representative a separate capital market advisory fee of $2,500,000 upon completion of the initial Business Combination. Additionally, we will pay the representative a cash fee equal to 1.0% of the total consideration payable in the proposed Business Combination if the representative introduces us to the target business with which the Company completes a Business Combination.\nRight of First Refusal\nIf we determine to pursue any equity, equity-linked, debt or mezzanine financing relating to or in connection with an initial Business Combination, then Northland Securities, Inc. shall have the right, but not the obligation,\nto act as book running manager, placement agent and/or arranger, as the case may be, in any and all such financing or financings.\nThis right of first refusal extends from the date of the IPO until the earlier of the consummation of an initial Business Combination or the liquidation of the Trust Account if the Company fails to consummate a Business Combination during the required time period.\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the Founder Shares issued and outstanding on the date of the IPO, as well as the holders of the representative shares, Private Shares and any shares the sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may issue in payment of Working Capital Loans made to us, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of the IPO. The holders of a majority of these securities (other than the holders of the representative shares) are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the Founder Shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the Private Shares and shares issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in payment of Working Capital Loans made to us can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 1.0% of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or $1,500,000 (and are entitled to an additional $225,000 of deferred underwriting commission payable at the time of an initial Business Combination if the underwriters over-allotment is exercised in full). On October 1, 2021 the underwriters over-allotment option expired unused resulting in the $225,000 deferred underwriting commission to be not payable to the underwriter.\nBusiness Combination Agreement\nWe are party to the Business Combination Agreement with Rezolve, Cayman NewCo and Rezolve Merger Sub, dated December 17, 2021. Completion of the proposed transaction pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of the Companys and Rezolves respective stockholders and regulatory approvals.\nOn November 10, 2022 Armada and Rezolve entered into a First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment), to among other things, extend the date on which either party to the Business Combination Agreement had the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the Business Combination had not been completed by such date, and change the structure of the Business Combination such that Cayman NewCo is no longer a party to the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination.\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, the Company and the Key Company Shareholders (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) have entered into the Transaction Support Agreement (the Transaction Support Agreement), pursuant to which, among other things, the Key Company Shareholders have agreed to (a) vote in favor of the Company Reorganization (b) vote in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the agreements contemplated thereby and the transactions contemplated thereby, (c) enter into the Investor Rights Agreement (as described below) at Closing and (d) the termination of certain agreements effective as of Closing. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nFollowing the consummation of our IPO on August 17, 2021, after releasing funds to Armada to be held outside of the Trust, $150,000,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the units in the IPO was held in a Trust Account and has been invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nARMADA ACQUISITION CORP. I\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID #688)\nFinancial Statements:\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders (Deficit) Equity\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Financial Statements\nto\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT/ REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors of\nArmada Acquisition Corp. I\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Armada Acquisition Corp. I (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders (deficit) equity and cash flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph\n-\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Companys business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Companys cash and working capital as of September 30, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum\nLLP\nMarcum LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nNew York, NY\nDecember 21\n, 2022\nARMADA ACQUISITION CORP.

I\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1 - Organization, Business Operations and Going Concern\nArmada Acquisition Corp. I (the Company) is a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation on November 5, 2020. The Company was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination). As more fully described in this Note 1, on December 17, 2021, the Company entered into a business combination agreement with a target business. The Company concentrated its efforts in identifying businesses in the financial services industry with particular emphasis on businesses that are providing or changing technology for traditional financial services.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2022, relates to the Companys formation and the initial public offering (the IPO) described below, and since the closing of the IPO, the search for a prospective initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the IPO.\nThe Companys sponsor is Armada Sponsor LLC (the Sponsor). The registration statement for the Companys IPO was declared effective on August 12, 2021 (the Effective Date). On August 17, 2021, the Company commenced the IPO of 15,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit (the Units).\nSimultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, the Company consummated the private placement of 459,500 shares of common stock (Private Shares), at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,000.\nTransaction costs amounted to $3,537,515 consisting of $1,500,000 of underwriting commissions, and $2,037,515 of other offering costs.\nFollowing the closing of the IPO on August 17, 2021, after releasing funds to the Company to be held outside of the Trust, $150,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO was held in a Trust Account (Trust Account) and has been invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay tax obligations, the proceeds from the IPO and the sale of the Private Shares will not be released from the Trust Account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or the Companys redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if it has not completed a Business Combination in the required time period The proceeds held in the Trust Account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which the Company completes a Business Combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business. As of September 30, 2022, the Trust Account has released $182,069 to the Company to pay tax obligations.\nThe Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the sale of Private Shares, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination.\nThe Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (as defined below) (excluding deferred\nunderwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully.\nIn connection with any proposed Business Combination, the Company will either (1) seek stockholders approval of the initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination or dont vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide its stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to the Company by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholders approval of a proposed Business Combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion.\nThe shares of common stock subject to redemption are recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the IPO, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.\nFollowing the exercise of the automatic extension of the deadline for the Company to complete an initial business combination under our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, the Company has until February 17, 2023 (or 18 months following our initial public offering) to consummate a business combination (unless we further extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) (the Combination Period). However, if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company but net of taxes payable (and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining stockholders and the Companys board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to the Companys obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed (i) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (ii) not to redeem any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination or sell any shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a proposed initial Business Combination, (iii) that the founders shares will not participate in any liquidating distributions from the Companys Trust Account upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated.\nThe Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the Trust Account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Company for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to the Company. The agreement to be entered into by the Sponsor will specifically provide for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will\nhave no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the Trust Account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the IPO against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked its Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has it independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsors only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company believes it is unlikely that the Sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so.\nOn December 17, 2021, the Company entered into a business combination agreement with Rezolve Limited, a private limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (Rezolve\n), Rezolve Group Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company (Cayman NewCo\n), and Rezolve Merger Sub, Inc., (Rezolve Merger Sub\n) (such business combination agreement, the Business Combination Agreement\n, and such business combination, the Business Combination\n).\nIn connection with the execution of the definitive Business Combination Agreement, certain investors have agreed to purchase an aggregate of 2,050,000 ordinary shares of Cayman NewCo for the purchase price of $10.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $20.5 million pursuant to certain subscription agreements (the Subscription Agreements\n). The obligations of each party under the subscription agreements are conditioned upon customary closing conditions and the consummation of the Business Combination.\nConcurrently with the execution and delivery of the Business Combination Agreement, Armada and the Key Company Shareholders (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) have entered into the Transaction Support Agreement (the Transaction Support Agreement\n), pursuant to which, among other things, the Key Company Shareholders have agreed to (a) vote in favor of the Company Reorganization (b) vote in favor of the Business Combination Agreement and the agreements contemplated thereby and the transactions contemplated thereby, (c) enter into the Investor Rights Agreement (as described below) at Closing and (d) the termination of certain agreements effective as of Closing.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company and Rezolve entered into a First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment, and together with the Original Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement and the business combination contemplated thereby, the Business Combination), to among other things, extend the date on which either party to the Business Combination Agreement had the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the Business Combination had not been completed by such date to the later of (i) January 31, 2023 or (ii) fifteen days prior to the last date on which the Company may consummate a Business Combination, and change the structure of the Business Combination such that Cayman NewCo is no longer a party to the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination.\nLiquidity and Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $0.2 million in its operating account and working capital deficiency of approximately $3.1 million (excluding income tax payable and franchise tax payable).\nPrior to the completion of the IPO, the Companys liquidity needs have been satisfied through the $36,045 proceeds received from the sale of its Founder Shares to the Sponsor, the advances of $230,352 from the Sponsor to cover the Companys offering costs in connection with the IPO, and the net proceeds from the consummation of the Private Placement not held in the Trust Account. The balance of the advances from Sponsor was fully repaid on August 17, 2021.\nOn May 9, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company the aggregate amount of $483,034 in order to assist the Company to fund its working capital needs (see Note 5). The loan is evidenced by two promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $483,034 from the Company, as maker, to the Sponsor, as payee. The promissory notes are non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of: (i) the liquidation or release of all of the monies held in the Trust Account or (ii) the date on which the Company consummates an acquisition, merger or other business combination transaction involving the Company or its affiliates. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time. During July 2022, the Company fully repaid one of the promissory notes in the amount of $187,034\nwhich represented monies loaned to the Company for the payment of Delaware franchise taxes. The Company utilized the interest earned on the Trust Account to repay the promissory note. The Company also paid $44,246\non behalf of the Sponsor for tax services in August and September 2022, resulting in $251,754\nbalance outstanding under the second promissory note as of September 30, 2022.\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Companys Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company with Working Capital Loans, as defined below (see Note 5). As of September 30, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans.\nIn connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management determined that the liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern through February 17, 2023, the scheduled liquidation date of the Company if it does not complete a Business Combination prior to such date. These unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is continuing to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry, the geopolitical conditions resulting from the recent invasion of Ukraine by Russia and subsequent sanctions against Russia, Belarus and related individuals and entities and the status of debt and equity markets, as well as protectionist legislation in our target markets and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that it could have a negative effect on the Companys financial position, results of its operations and/or that of Rezolves or any other target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act) was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of stock by publicly traded U.S. domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax.\nAny redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or\notherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of the Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with the Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of the Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Companys ability to complete a Business Combination.\nNote 2 - Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements of the Company are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have been made that are necessary to present fairly the financial position, and the results of its operations and its cash flows.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart the Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had $177,578 and $657,590 in cash as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInvestment Held in Trust Account\nAs of September 30, 2022, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in U.S. Treasury Bills with a maturity of 185 days or less and in money market funds which invest in U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe Company classifies its US Treasury bills as held-to-maturity in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 320 Investments-Debt and Equity Securities. Held-to-maturity securities are those securities which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity. Held-to-maturity treasury securities are recorded at amortized cost and adjusted for the amortization or accretion of premiums or discounts.\nA decline in the market value of held-to-maturity securities below cost that is deemed to be other than temporary, results in an impairment that reduces the carrying costs to such securities fair value. The impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security is established. To determine whether an impairment is other than temporary, the Company considers whether it has the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and considers whether evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and the duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the investee, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates.\nPremiums and discounts are amortized or accreted over the life of the related held-to-maturity security as an adjustment to yield using the effective-interest method. Such amortization and accretion are included in the interest income line item in the unaudited condensed statements of operations. Interest income is recognized when earned.\nThe carrying value, excluding gross unrealized holding loss, and fair value of held to maturity securities on September 30, 2022 are as follows:\nCarrying\nValue as of\nSeptember 30,\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair Value\nas of\nSeptember 30,\nCash\n$\n$ -\n$ -\n$\nU.S. Treasury Bills\n150,844,605\n19,242\n-\n150,863,847\n$ 150,844,925\n$ 19,242\n$ -\n$ 150,864,167\nAs of September 30, 2021, the assets held in the Trust Account were held in a money market fund, which were classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheets at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of these securities is included in gain on Investments Held in Trust Account in the accompanying statement of operations.\nThe estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information and are characterized as Level 1 investments within the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 (as described below).\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value\nhierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:\nLevel 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets;\nLevel 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and\nLevel 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe fair value of certain of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet. The fair values of cash, prepaid expenses, accrued offering costs and expenses, and promissory notes to related party are estimated to approximate the carrying values as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, due to the short maturities of such instruments.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation limit of $250,000. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has not experienced losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.\nOffering Costs Associated with IPO\nThe Company complies with the requirements of ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A-Expenses of Offering. Offering costs consist of legal, accounting, underwriting and other costs incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the IPO. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $3,537,515 as a result of the IPO consisting of a $1,500,000 underwriting commissions, and $2,037,515 of other offering costs.\nCommon Stock Subject to Possible Redemption\nThe Company accounts for its common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Common stock subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as a liability instrument and measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock are classified as stockholders equity. The Companys shares of common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, 15,000,000 shares of common stock subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders equity section of the Companys balance sheet.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur. Immediately upon the closing of the IPO, the Company recognized the remeasurement adjustment from initial carrying amount to redemption book value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable common stock resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital.\nAt September 30, 2022, the common stock reflected in the balance sheets are reconciled in the following table:\nGross Proceeds\n$\n150,000,000\nLess: Proceeds allocated to Public Warrants\n(11,700,000\n)\nLess: Issuance costs related to common stock\n(3,261,589\n)\nPlus: Remeasurement of carrying value to redemption value\n14,961,589\nCommon stock subject to possible redemption - September 30, 2021\n$\n150,000,000\nPlus: Subsequent remeasurement of carrying value to redemption value - Trust interest income (excluding the amount that can be withdrawn from Trust Account)\n548,862\nCommon stock subject to possible redemption - September 30, 2022\n$\n150,548,862\nNet Loss Per Common Stock\nThe Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share. Net loss per common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period. Remeasurement adjustments associated with the redeemable shares of common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.\nThe calculation of diluted loss per share does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the IPO because the warrants are contingently exercisable, and the contingencies have not yet been met. The warrants are exercisable to purchase 7,500,000 shares of common stock in the aggregate. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities or other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into common stock and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted net loss per common stock is the same as basic net loss per common stock for the periods presented.\nAccretion of the carrying value of common stock subject to redemption value is excluded from net loss per common stock because the redemption value approximates fair value.\nFor the year ended\nSeptember 30, 2022\nFor the period from November 5, 2020\n(inception)\nthrough September 30, 2021\nCommon stock\nsubject to\nredemption\nCommon\nstock\nCommon stock\nsubject to\nredemption\nCommon stock\nBasic and diluted net loss per share\nNumerator:\nAllocation of net loss\n$ (2,624,009 )\n$ (998,785 )\n$ (160,012 )\n$ (308,887 )\nDenominator\nWeighted-average shares outstanding\n15,000,000\n5,709,500\n2,045,455\n3,948,530\nBasic and diluted net loss per share\n$ (0.17 )\n$ (0.17 )\n$ (0.08 )\n$ (0.08 )\nStock Based Compensation\nOn June 16, 2021, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 shares to each of its Chief Executive Officer and to its President and 35,000 shares to each of its three independent directors. The aggregate fair value of these shares\nwas $509,552 at issuance. During the year ended September 30, 2022 and for the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, the Company recognized $111,852 and $285,846 of stock-based compensation expense, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. ASC 740, Income Taxes, requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carry forwards. ASC 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nASC 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC 740 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim period, disclosure and transition.\nThe Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nThe Company has identified the United States as its only major tax jurisdiction. The Company is subject to income taxation by major taxing authorities since inception. These examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions, the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with federal and state tax laws. The Companys management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entitys own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments. ASU 2020-06 is effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of ASU 2020-06 to its financial statements.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nNote 3 - Initial Public Offering\nOn August 17, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of 15,000,000 Units, at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Only whole warrants are exercisable. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the units and only whole warrants will trade.\nThe warrants will become exercisable\n30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination, and will expire\nfive years after the completion of the initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation (see Note\n8).\nFollowing the closing of the IPO and settlement of funds on August 17, 2021, $150,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the IPO and the sales of Private Shares was placed in the Trust Account and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations.\nNote 4 - Private Placement\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Companys Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 459,500 Private Shares, at a price of $10.00 per Private Share, for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,500 in a private placement. The proceeds from the sale of the Private Shares was added to the proceeds of the IPO and placed in a U.S.-based trust account. If the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination within 15 months (or 18 months if extended) from the closing of the IPO, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Shares will be included in the liquidating distribution to the public stockholders and the Private Shares will be worthless.\nNote 5 - Related Party Transactions\nFounder Shares\nOn February 3, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000, approximately $0.006 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 4,312,500 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001. On June 16, 2021, the Sponsor purchased an additional 700,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.006 per share, or an aggregate $4,070, and transferred 50,000 shares to its Chief Executive Officer and to its President and 35,000 shares to each of its three independent directors. On July 23, 2021, the Sponsor purchased an additional 1,200,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.006 per share, or an aggregate $6,975, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 6,007,500 shares of common stock and the Chief Executive Officer, President and independent directors holding an aggregate of 205,000 shares of common stock (such shares, collectively, the Founder Shares). The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 1,125,000 shares subject to forfeiture by the Sponsor to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment option was not exercised in full or in part. On October 1, 2021 the underwriters over-allotment option expired unused resulting in 1,125,000 founder shares forfeited to the Company for no consideration.\nThe Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any Founder Shares held by them until the earliest of (A) 180 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and (B) subsequent to the initial Business Combination, the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in all of the public stockholders having the right to exchange their public shares for cash, securities or other property.\nAdditionally, upon consummation of the IPO, the Sponsor sold membership interests in the Sponsor to 10 anchor investors that purchased 9.9% of the units sold in the IPO. The Sponsor sold membership interests in the Sponsor entity reflecting an allocation of 131,250 Founder Shares to each anchor investor, or an aggregate of 1,312,500\nFounder Shares to all\n10 anchor investors, at a purchase price of approximately $\n0.006 per share. The Company estimated the aggregate fair value of these founder shares attributable to each anchor investor to be $\n424,491, or $\n3.23 per share. The Company has offset the excess of the fair value against the gross proceeds from these anchor investors as a reduction in its additional paid-in capital in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A.\nRepresentative Common Stock\nOn February 8, 2021, EarlyBirdCapital, Inc. and Northland Securities, Inc. (Northland) purchased 162,500 and 87,500 shares of common stock (representative shares), respectively, at an average purchase price of\napproximately $0.0001 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $25.00. On May 29, 2021, Northland returned 87,500 shares of common stock to the Company, for no consideration, which were subsequently cancelled.\nThe\nrepresentative shares are identical to the public shares included in the Units being sold in the IPO, except that the representative shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions, as described in more detail below.\nThe holders of the representative shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until 30 days after the completion of an initial Business Combination. In addition, the holders of the representative shares have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights (or right to participate in any tender offer) with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of an initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete an initial Business Combination within 15 months (or 18 months if extended) from the closing of the IPO.\nPromissory Notes-Related Party\nOn February 3, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of the IPO. These loans were non-interest bearing, unsecured and were due at the earlier of October 31, 2021 or the closing of the IPO. The Company borrowed $230,352 under the promissory note and the Company repaid in full upon settlement of funds from the IPO on August 17, 2021.\nOn May 9, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company the aggregate amount of $483,034 in order to assist the Company to fund its working capital needs. The loan is evidenced by two promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $483,034 from the Company, as maker, to the Sponsor, as payee. The promissory notes are non-interest bearing and due on the earlier of: (i) the liquidation or release of all of the monies held in the Trust Account or (ii) the date on which the Company consummates an acquisition, merger or other business combination transaction involving the Company or its affiliates. The principal balance may be prepaid at any time.\nDuring July 2022, the Company fully repaid one of the promissory notes in the amount of $187,034 which represented monies loaned to the Company for the payment of Delaware franchise taxes. The Company utilized the interest earned on the Trust Account to repay the promissory note. The Company also paid $44,246 on behalf of the Sponsor for tax services in August and September 2022, resulting in $251,754 balance outstanding under the second promissory note as of September 30, 2022.\nWorking Capital Loans\nIn order to meet the Companys working capital needs following the consummation of the IPO, the Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds (Working Capital Loans), from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be non-interest bearing and be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of the initial Business Combination, without interest, or, at holders discretion,\nup to\n$\n1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into shares at a price of $\n10.00 per share. The shares would be identical to the Private Shares. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment.

On October 1, 2021 the underwriters over-allotment option expired unused resulting in the $225,000 deferred underwriting commission to be not payable to the underwriter.\nFinancial Advisory Fee\nThe Company engaged Cohen & Company Capital Markets, a division of J.V.B. Financial Group, LLC (CCM), an affiliate of a member of the Sponsor, to provide consulting and advisory services in connection with the IPO, for which it received an advisory fee equal to one (1.0) percent of the aggregate proceeds of the IPO, or $1,500,000, upon closing of the IPO.

The estimated fair values of investments held in the Trust Account are determined using available market information and are characterized as Level 1 investments.\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 8 - Stockholders Equity\nPreferred stock\n-The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 and with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Companys board of directors. As of September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.\nCommon stock\n-The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. At September 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 5,709,500 and 6,834,500 shares of common stock issued and outstanding excluding 15,000,000 shares subject to redemption, respectively. On February 3, 2021, affiliates of the Sponsor paid $25,000, or approximately $0.006 per share, to cover certain offering costs in consideration for 4,312,500 Founder Shares.

On June 16, 2021, the Sponsor transferred 50,000 shares to its Chief Executive Officer and to its President and 35,000 shares to each of its three outside directors.

On October 1, 2021 the underwriters over-allotment option expired unused resulting in 1,125,000 founder shares forfeited to the Company for no consideration.\nCommon stockholders of record are entitled to\none vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. In connection with any vote held to approve the initial Business Combination, the Sponsor, as well as all of the Companys officers and directors, have agreed to vote their respective shares of common stock owned by them immediately prior to the IPO and any shares purchased in the IPO or following the IPO in the open market in favor of the proposed Business Combination.\nWarrants\n-Each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed herein. The warrants will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of the Companys initial Business Combination. However, no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days following the consummation of the initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In the event of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock for the 5 trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of the completion of an initial Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe Company may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, in whole and not in part:\nat any time after the warrants become exercisable,\nupon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder\nif, and only if, the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing at any time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and\nif, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants.\nIf the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, the Companys management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value\n(defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of common stock\nfor the 5 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.\nIn addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Companys board of directors, and in the case of any such issuance to the\nSponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founders shares held by them prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) the Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issues the additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities.\nNote 9 - Income Tax\nThe Companys net deferred tax assets are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nDeferred tax asset\nOrganizational costs/Startup expenses\n$ 351,592\n$ 32,957\nStock-based compensation\n83,517\n60,028\nFederal net operating loss\n-\n5,484\nTotal deferred tax asset\n435,209\n98,469\nValuation allowance\n(435,209 )\n(98,469 )\nDeferred tax asset, net of allowance\n$ -\n$ -\nThe income tax provision consists of the following:\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nFederal\nCurrent\n$ 145,621\n$ -\nDeferred\n(336,741 )\n(98,469 )\nState\nCurrent\n-\n-\nDeferred\n-\n-\nChange in valuation allowance\n336,741\n98,469\nIncome tax provision\n$ 145,621\n$ -\nAs of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has $0 and $26,113 of U.S. federal net operating loss carryovers, which do not expire, and no state net operating loss carryovers available to offset future taxable income.\nIn assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled\nreversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the year ended September 30, 2022 and the period from November 5, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2021, the change in the valuation allowance\nwas $336,741 and $98,469, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the federal income tax rate to the Companys effective tax rate at September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n21.00 %\n21.00 %\nState taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n0.00 %\n0.00 %\nBusiness combination expenses\n(15.50 )%\n0.00 %\nChange in valuation allowance\n(9.70 )%\n(21.00 )%\nIncome tax provision\n(4.25 )%\n- %\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction in various state and local jurisdictions and is subject to examination by the various taxing authorities.\nNote 10 - Subsequent Events\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, other than described below, the Company did not identify any subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in these financial statements.\nOn November 10, 2022, the Company and Rezolve entered into a First Amendment to the Business Combination Agreement (the Amendment, and together with the Original Business Combination Agreement, the Business Combination Agreement and the business combination contemplated thereby, the Business Combination), to among other things, extend the date on which either party to the Business Combination Agreement had the right to terminate the Business Combination Agreement if the Business Combination had not been completed by such date to the later of (i) January 31, 2023 or (ii) fifteen days prior to the last date on which the Company may consummate a Business Combination, and change the structure of the Business Combination such that Cayman NewCo is no longer a party to the Business Combination Agreement or the Business Combination.

Nasdaqs standards define financially literate as being able to read and understand fundamental financial statements, including a companys balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.\nIn addition, we must certify to Nasdaq that the committee has, and will continue to have, at least one member who has past employment experience in finance or accounting, requisite professional certification in accounting, or other comparable experience or background that results in the individuals financial sophistication. The board of directors has determined that Mr. Decker qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under rules and regulations of the SEC.\nDirector Nominations\nWe do not have a standing nominating committee though we intend to form a corporate governance and nominating committee as and when required to do so by law or Nasdaq rules. In accordance with Rule 5605 of\nthe Nasdaq rules, a majority of the independent directors may recommend a director nominee for selection by the board of directors. The board of directors believes that the independent directors can satisfactorily carry out the responsibility of properly selecting or approving director nominees without the formation of a standing nominating committee. The directors who will participate in the consideration and recommendation of director nominees are Messrs. Decker, Kahn, and White. In accordance with Rule 5605 of the Nasdaq rules, all such directors are independent. As there is no standing nominating committee, we do not have a nominating committee charter in place.\nThe board of directors will also consider director candidates recommended for nomination by our stockholders during such times as they are seeking proposed nominees to stand for election at the next annual meeting of stockholders (or, if applicable, a special meeting of stockholders). Our stockholders that wish to nominate a director for election to our board of directors should follow the procedures set forth in our bylaws.\nWe have not formally established any specific, minimum qualifications that must be met or skills that are necessary for directors to possess. In general, in identifying and evaluating nominees for director, the board of directors considers educational background, diversity of professional experience, knowledge of our business, integrity, professional reputation, independence, wisdom, and the ability to represent the best interests of our stockholders.\nCompensation Committee\nWe have established a compensation committee of the board of directors, which consists of Messrs. Decker and Kahn, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaqs listing standards. The compensation committees duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:\nreviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officer based on such evaluation;\nreviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;\nreviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;\nimplementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\nassisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\napproving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;\nif required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\nreviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nCompensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation\nNone of our executive officers currently serves, and in the past year has not served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors.\nSection 16 (a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than ten percent of our common stock to file reports of ownership and\nchanges in ownership with the SEC. These reporting persons are also required to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely upon a review of such Forms, we believe that during the year ended September 30, 2022 there were no delinquent filers.\nCode of Ethics\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to all of our executive officers, directors and employees. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.\nConflicts of Interest\nIn general, officers and directors of a corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware are required to present business opportunities to a corporation if:\nthe corporation could financially undertake the opportunity;\nthe opportunity is within the corporations line of business; and\nit would not be fair to the corporation and its stockholders for the opportunity not to be brought to the attention of the corporation.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that:\nexcept as may be prescribed by any written agreement with us, we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue; and\nour officers and directors will not be liable to our company or our stockholders for monetary damages for breach of any fiduciary duty by reason of any of our activities or any of our sponsor or its affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law.\nOur officers and directors are, and may in the future become, affiliated with other companies. In order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from such other corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of our execution of a definitive agreement for a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have. The foregoing agreement does not restrict our officers and directors from becoming affiliated with other companies in the future which could take priority over our company. However, we believe that such agreement still benefits us because our officers and directors are obligated to present suitable business opportunities to us to the extent that none of their other fiduciary or contractual obligations require them to present it to another entity.\nThe following table summarizes the pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations of our officers and directors besides our sponsor:\nName of Individual\nName of Affiliated Entity\nAffiliation\nDouglas M. Lurio\nElbeco Incorporated\nDirector\nLurio & Associates, P.C.\nFounder and President\nMohammad A. Khan\nOmnyway, Inc.\nCo-founder, President and Director\nName of Individual\nName of Affiliated Entity\nAffiliation\nThomas A. Decker\nActua Corporation\nDirector\nCozen OConnor\nVice Chairman\nCelso L. White\nIgniting Business Growth LLC\nCo-Founder and Chief Executive Officer\nCF Industries Holdings, Inc.\nDirector\nWhile the foregoing may limit the pool of potential business combination candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.\nInvestors should also be aware of the following additional potential conflicts of interest:\nNone of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities.\nUnless we consummate our initial business combination, our officers, directors and sponsor will not receive reimbursement or repayment for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them, or loans made to us, to the extent that such expenses exceed the amount of available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.\nThe founder shares and private shares beneficially owned by our initial stockholders will become worthless if a business combination is not consummated. Additionally, our officers and directors and affiliates will not receive liquidation distributions from the trust account with respect to any of the founder shares or the private shares. Furthermore, our sponsor has agreed that the private shares will not be sold or transferred by it until after we have completed a business combination.\nFor the foregoing reasons, our board may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate to effect a business combination with.\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors, or sponsor unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. We will also need to obtain the approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors. Furthermore, other than payments to CCM, in no event will any of our sponsor, members of our management team or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees to our sponsor, officers, directors, initial stockholders or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, repayment of the up to $300,000 loan and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses.\nLimitation on Liability and Indemnification of Officers and Directors\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our officers and directors will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by Delaware law, as it now exists or may in the future be amended. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors, except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by Delaware law.\nWe have entered into agreements without officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Our bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any officer, director or employee for any liability arising out of\nhis or her actions, regardless of whether Delaware law would permit such indemnification. We also have obtained a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our officers and directors against the cost of defense, settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our officers and directs.\nThese provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions.\nWe believe that these provisions, the directors and officers liability insurance and the indemnity agreements are necessary to attract and retain talented and experiences officers and directors. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nNo executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Commencing on the date of this Annual Report through the acquisition of a target business or our liquidation of the trust account, we will pay our sponsor $10,000 per month for providing us with office space and certain office and secretarial services. However, this arrangement is solely for our benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors compensation in lieu of a salary. We may also pay consulting, finder or success fees to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial business combination with such fee to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the business combination.\nOther than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees to our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination and the repayment of any loans made by our sponsor to us, no compensation or fees of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, they will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of consulting, success or finder fees payable by us upon consummation of an initial business combination. Additionally, there is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K or a periodic report, as required by the SEC.\nDirector Compensation\nNone of our directors has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. Our sponsor, executive officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates are reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.\nAfter the completion of our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees. All of these fees will be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials or tender offer materials furnished to our stockholders in connection with a proposed business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount of such fees that may be paid to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed business combination, because the directors of the post-combination business will be responsible for determining executive officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our executive officers will be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors. ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe following table sets forth as of September 30, 2022 information regarding the beneficial ownership of our shares of common stock as of the date of this Annual Report and as adjusted to reflect the sale of our shares of common stock included in the units sold in this offering and the sale of the private shares (assuming none of the individuals listed purchase units in this offering), by:\neach person known by us to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;\neach of our officers and directors; and\nall of our officers and directors as a group.\nUnless otherwise indicated, we believe that all persons named in the table have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock beneficially owned by them.

Accordingly, all securities held by our sponsor may ultimately be deemed to be beneficially held by Mr. Herbert and Mr. Lurio.\nRestrictions on Transfers of Founder Shares and Private shares\nOur sponsor beneficially owns approximately 26% of the then issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Because of the ownership block held by our sponsor, officers, or directors , such individuals may be able to effectively exercise influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions other than approval of our initial business combination.\nOur sponsor forfeited 1,125,000 founder shares, since the underwriters did not exercise any of the over-allotment option.\nAll of the founder shares were placed in escrow with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as escrow agent, and are expected to remain in escrow until 180 days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier, if, subsequent to our initial business combination, we consummate a liquidation,\nmerger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.\nDuring the escrow period, the holders of these shares are not be able to sell or transfer their securities except for transfers, assignments or sales (i) among such holders or to such holders members, officers, directors, consultants or their affiliates, (ii) to a holders stockholders or members upon its liquidation, (iii) by bona fide gift to a member of the holders immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary of which is the holder or a member of the holders immediate family, for estate planning purposes, (iv) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (v) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (vi) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, or (vii) in connection with the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased, in each case (except for clause (vi) or with our prior consent) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement and to be bound by these transfer restrictions, but will retain all other rights as our stockholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote their shares of common stock and the right to receive cash dividends, if declared. If dividends are declared and payable in shares of common stock, such dividends will also be placed in escrow. If we are unable to effect a business combination and liquidate, there will be no liquidation distribution with respect to the founder shares.\nOur sponsor purchased an aggregate of 459,500 private shares at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,000. The initial purchasers agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private shares (except in connection with the same limited exceptions that the founder shares may be transferred as described above) until after the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the private shares will likely be worthless.\nIn order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of our initial public offering, our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. On November 10, 2022, our sponsor loaned us $1.5 million in order to cover the additional contribution to the trust account in connection with the automatic extension of the deadline to complete our initial business combination and $0.45 million dollars for working capital purposes. Each loan is non-interest bearing and evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\nOur executive officers and our sponsor are our promoters, as that term is defined under the federal securities laws. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nIn February 2021, we issued 4,312,500 shares of common stock to our sponsor for $25,000 in cash, at a purchase price of approximately $0.006 per share, in connection with our organization. On June 16, 2021, our sponsor purchased an additional 700,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.006 per share, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 5,012,500 founder shares. On June 16, 2021, our sponsor transferred 50,000 founder shares to each of Messrs. Herbert and Lurio and 35,000 founder shares to each of Messrs. Khan, Decker and White. On July 23, 2021, our sponsor purchased an additional 1,200,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.006 per share, resulting in our sponsor holding an aggregate of 6,007,500 shares of common stock. If the underwriters do not exercise all or a portion of their over-allotment option, our sponsor will forfeit up to an aggregate of 1,125,000 shares of common stock in proportion to the portion of the over-allotment option that was not exercised. Additionally, upon consummation of our initial business combination, our sponsor will sell founder shares to each anchor investor that purchases the full number of units allocated to it in this offering. Each anchor investor has agreed that if it does not purchase the units allocated to such anchor investor in this offering, it will not have any rights to purchase such founder shares from our sponsor.\nOur sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 459,500 private shares at a price of $10.00 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $4,595,000. The initial purchasers have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private shares (except in connection with the same limited exceptions that the founder shares may be transferred as described above) until after the completion of our initial business combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our initial business combination, the private shares will likely be worthless.\nIn order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be non-interest bearing and be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.\nThe holders of our founder shares, as well as the holders of the private shares and any shares of common stock our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us (and all underlying securities), will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to an agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of this offering. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the founder shares and private shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these shares of common stock are to be released from escrow. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our sponsor has loaned us $251,754 for working capital purposes. Our sponsor has agreed that, until the earlier of our consummation of our initial business combination or the liquidation of the trust account, it will make available to us certain general and administrative services, including office space, utilities and administrative support, as we may require from time to time. We have agreed to pay $10,000 per month for these services. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that these fees are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.\nOn November 10, 2022, our Sponsor loaned us $1.5 million in order to cover the additional contribution to the trust account required in connection with the automatic extension of the deadline to complete our initial business combination and $0.45 million dollars for working capital purposes.\nPursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we extended the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months for a total of 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering. In order to effectuate such extension, our sponsor deposited into the trust account $1,500,000, or $0.10 per share. The payment was made to the Company by the Sponsor in the form of a non-interest bearing loan payable upon the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a business combination, such loan will not be repaid.\nWe have entered into agreements with our officers and directors to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nWe may also pay consulting, finder or success fees to our initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial business combination with such fee to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the business combination.\nOther than the payments to CCM, the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees to our sponsor, officers, directors, or their affiliates in connection with the consummation of our\ninitial business combination and repayment of any loans, no compensation or fees of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or their respective affiliates, for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. There is no limit on the amount of consulting, success or finder fees payable by us upon consummation of an initial business combination. Additionally, there is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination.\nAfter our initial business combination, members of our management team who remain with us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the proxy solicitation materials furnished to our stockholders. However, the amount of such compensation may not be known at the time of the stockholder meeting held to consider an initial business combination, as it will be up to the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation. In this event, such compensation will be publicly disclosed at the time of its determination in a Current Report on Form 8-K or a periodic report, as required by the SEC.\nAll ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by a majority of our uninterested independent directors or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nRelated Party Policy\nOur Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our shares of common stock, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.\nOur audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. The audit committee will consider all relevant factors when determining whether to approve a related party transaction, including whether the related party transaction is on terms no less favorable to us than terms generally available from an unaffiliated third-party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related partys interest in the transaction. No director may participate in the approval of any transaction in which he is a related party, but that director is required to provide the audit committee with all material information concerning the transaction. We also require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate an initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our sponsor, officers or directors unless we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view. We will also need to obtain approval of a majority of our disinterested independent directors. ITEM 14.
