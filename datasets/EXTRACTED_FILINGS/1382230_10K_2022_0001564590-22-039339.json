Our telephone number at this address is (570) 421-0531. Our website address is www.essabank.com.\nMarket Area\nAt September 30, 2022, our 21 community offices consisted of seven offices in Monroe County, three offices in Lehigh County, five offices in Northampton County, one office in Lackawanna County, one office in Luzerne County, one office in Chester County, two offices in Delaware County and one office in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. Our primary market for deposits is currently concentrated around the areas where our full-service banking offices are located. Our primary lending area consists of the counties where our branch offices are located, and to a lesser extent, the contiguous counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nMonroe County is located in eastern Pennsylvania, situated 90 miles north of Philadelphia, 75 miles west of New York and 116 miles northeast of Harrisburg. Monroe County is comprised of 611 square miles of mostly rural terrain. Major industries include tourism, healthcare and educational facilities. Northampton County is located south of Monroe County and directly borders New Jersey. Lehigh County is located southwest of Monroe County. Luzerne and Lackawanna Counties are located north of Monroe County. Chester and Montgomery Counties are located south and Delaware County southwest of Monroe County. As of June 30, 2022, the most recent FDIC market share data available, we had a deposit market share of approximately 20.7% in Monroe County, which represented the second largest deposit market share in Monroe County, 2.4% in Northampton County, 1.6% in Lehigh County, 0.3% in Lackawanna County, 0.6% in Luzerne County, 0.1% in Chester County, 0.1% in Montgomery County and 0.6% in Delaware County.\nLending Activities\nHistorically, our principal lending activity had been the origination of first mortgage loans for the purchase, construction or refinancing of one- to four-family residential real estate property. For years, we have been increasing our originations of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans in an effort to increase interest income, diversify our loan portfolio, and better serve the community. Commercial real estate loans have increased from $591.1 million or 43.4% of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2021 to $678.8 million, or 46.6%, of our total loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. One- to four-family residential real estate mortgage loans represented $623.4 million, or 42.9% of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. Home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $43.2 million, or 3.0%, of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. Commercial loans totaled $38.2 million, or 2.6%, of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2022 and construction first mortgage loans totaled $25.0 million, or 1.7%, of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. Obligations of states and political subdivisions totaled $40.4 million, or 2.8%, of our loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. Auto loans totaled $3.6 million or 0.2% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2022. As previously disclosed, the Bank discontinued originating indirect auto loans in July 2018. We originate other consumer loans on a limited basis.\nLoan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio, by type of loan at the dates indicated, excluding loans held for sale.\nAt September 30,\nAmount\nPercent\nAmount\nPercent\n(Dollars in thousands)\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n$\n623,375\n42.9\n%\n$\n580,313\n42.7\n%\nConstruction\n25,024\n1.7\n14,013\n1.0\nCommercial\n38,158\n2.6\n63,500\n4.7\nCommercial real estate\n678,841\n46.6\n591,117\n43.4\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n40,416\n2.8\n56,164\n4.1\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n43,170\n3.0\n38,426\n2.9\nAuto loans\n3,611\n0.3\n13,852\n1.0\nOther\n1,716\n0.1\n1,581\n0.2\nTotal loans receivable\n$\n1,454,311\n100.0\n%\n$\n1,358,966\n100.0\n%\nAllowance for loan losses\n(18,528\n)\n(18,113\n)\nTotal loans receivable, net\n$\n1,435,783\n$\n1,340,853\nLoan Portfolio Maturities.

We originate residential mortgage loans pursuant to underwriting standards that generally conform to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guidelines. Loan origination activities are primarily concentrated in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. New loans are generated primarily from the efforts of employees and advertising, a network of select mortgage brokers, other parties with whom we do business, customer referrals, and from walk-in customers. Loan applications are centrally underwritten and processed at our corporate center. At September 30, 2022, $623.4 million, or 42.9%, of our loan portfolio, consisted of one- to four-family residential loans. Generally, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are originated in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of the property, although loans may be made with higher loan-to-value ratios. Private mortgage insurance is required to compensate for the risk. Fixed-rate loans are originated for terms of 10, 15, 20 and 30 years. At September 30, 2022, our largest loan secured by one- to four-family real estate had a principal balance of approximately $5.8 million and was secured by a single-family house. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms.\nWe also offer adjustable-rate mortgage loans which have initial fixed terms of one, three, five or seven-years before converting to an annual adjustment schedule based on changes in a designated United States Treasury index. We originated $20.2 million and $642,000 in adjustable rate one- to four-family residential loans during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans provide for maximum rate adjustments of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a lifetime maximum adjustment of 500 basis points. Our adjustable rate mortgage loans amortize over terms of up to 30 years.\nAdjustable rate mortgage loans decrease the risk associated with changes in market interest rates by periodically repricing but involve other risks. As interest rates increase, the principal and interest payments on the loan increase, thus increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Adjustment of the contractual interest rate is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustments specified by our loan documents and therefore, is potentially limited in effectiveness during periods of rapidly rising interest rates. At September 30, 2022, $28.3 million, or 4.5%, of our one- to four-family residential loans had adjustable rates of interest.\nAll one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we originate include a due-on-sale clause, which provides the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that the borrower sells or otherwise conveys title to the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid.\nRegulations limit the amount that a savings bank may lend relative to the value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. For all purchase money loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Banks appraisal policy. All purchase money and most refinance loans require\na lenders title insurance policy. Certain modest refinance requests may utilize an exterior inspection report and title search. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance.\nHome Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. Home equity loans and lines of credit are generated by our loan originators. Eligible properties include primary and vacation homes located in Monroe, Northampton, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Lehigh, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania and secondarily in other Pennsylvania counties contiguous to our primary market area. As of September 30, 2022, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled about $43.2 million, or 3.0% of our loan portfolio.\nThe maximum combined loan-to-value originated is generally 80% although a maximum of 85% is permitted with more restrictive underwriting parameters depending on the collateral. There is a small portion of the portfolio originated in years past that contains original combined loan-to-values of up to 90%. Our home equity lines of credit typically feature a 10-year draw period with interest-only payments permitted, followed by another 20 years of fully amortizing payments with no further ability to draw funds. Similar combined loan-to-value characteristics and standards exist for the lines as are outlined above for the loans.\nLoan underwriting standards limit the maximum size of a junior lien loan to between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on the loan type and collateral. All loans exceeding 75% of value require an appraisal by bank-approved, licensed appraisers. Loans up to $25,000 with lesser loan-to-value ratios may utilize an automated valuation model. Title/lien searches are secured on all home equity loans and lines.\nCommercial Real Estate Loans. At September 30, 2022, $678.8 million, or 46.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans are secured by office and industrial buildings, multi-family, mixed-use properties and other commercial properties. We generally originate fixed rate commercial real estate loans with an initial term of five to seven years and a repricing option, and a maximum term of up to 25 years. The maximum loan-to-value ratio for most commercial real estate loans is 75% to 80%. At September 30, 2022, our largest commercial real estate relationship balance was $17.8 million, which was performing in accordance with its terms.\nWe consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the mortgaged property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrowers experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrowers payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service) to ensure that it is at least 120% of the monthly debt service. All commercial real estate loans in excess of $500,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Banks Appraisal Policy. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers although we may occasionally waive this requirement given very strong loan to value and debt service coverage ratios. All purchase money and most asset refinance borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance.\nLoans secured by commercial real estate generally are considered to present greater risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Commercial real estate loans often involve large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Repayment of these loans depends to a large degree on the results of operations and management of the properties securing the loans or the businesses conducted on such property and may be affected to a greater extent by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy in general. Accordingly, the nature of these loans makes them more difficult for management to monitor and evaluate.\nFirst Mortgage Construction Loans. At September 30, 2022, $25.0 million, or 1.7%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of first mortgage construction loans. Our first mortgage construction loans are for the construction of residential properties. We currently offer fixed- and adjustable-rate residential first mortgage construction loans. First mortgage construction loans are generally structured for permanent mortgage financing once the construction is completed. At September 30, 2022, our largest first mortgage construction loan balance was $3.0 million. The loan was performing in accordance with its terms. First mortgage construction loans will generally be made in amounts of up to 80% of the appraised value of the completed property, or the actual cost of the improvements. First mortgage construction loans require only the payment of interest during the construction period. Once converted to permanent financing, they generally repay over a 30-year period. Funds are disbursed based on our inspections in accordance with a schedule reflecting the completion of portions of the project.\nFirst mortgage construction loans generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than other one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. The risk of loss on a construction loan depends, in part, upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost of construction and the successful completion of construction within budget.\nFor all such loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers approved in accordance with the Banks Appraisal Policy. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance. We also require fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance on properties.\nCommercial Loans. At September 30, 2022, $38.2 million, or 2.6%, of our loan portfolio, consisted of commercial loans. We generally offer commercial loans to businesses located in our primary market area. The commercial loan portfolio includes lines of credit, equipment loans, vehicle loans, improvement loans and term loans. These loans are primarily secured by vehicles, machinery and equipment, inventory, accounts receivable, marketable securities, deposit accounts and real estate.\nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions. At September 30, 2022, $40.4 million, or 2.8%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of loan transactions including tax and revenue anticipation notes, general obligation notes, and authority general revenue notes. The financial strength of the state or political subdivision, type of transaction, relationship efforts, and profitability of return are considered when pricing and structuring each transaction.\nAuto Loans. At September 30, 2022, $3.6 million, or 0.2%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of auto loans. Although collateralized, these loans require stringent underwriting standards and procedures. Each loan decision is based primarily on the credit history of the individual(s) and their ability to repay the loan. Collision and comprehensive insurance is required and the Bank must be listed as the loss payee. As previously disclosed, the Bank discontinued originating indirect auto loans in July 2018.\nIndirect auto loans are inherently risky as they are often secured by assets that depreciate rapidly. In some cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted automobile loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan and the remaining deficiency may not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower. Automobile loan collections depend on the borrowers continuing financial stability, and therefore, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness, or personal bankruptcy.\nOther Loans. We offer a variety of loans that are either unsecured or secured by property other than real estate. These loans include loans secured by deposits and personal unsecured loans. At September 30, 2022, these other loans totaled $1.7 million, or 0.2%, of the total loan portfolio.\nLoan Approval Procedures and Authority. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrowers ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan, and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan. To assess the borrowers ability to repay, we review each borrowers employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. For all loans the Board has established a lending authority policy. Larger and more complex loan requests require the involvement of senior management or the Board.\nNon-Performing Loans and Problem Assets\nPerformance of the loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by Bank management. A number of factors regarding the borrower, such as overall financial strength, collateral values and repayment ability, are considered in deciding what actions should be taken when determining the collectability of interest for accrual purposes.\nWhen a loan, including a loan that is impaired, is classified as nonaccrual, the accrual of interest on such a loan is discontinued. A loan is typically classified as nonaccrual when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about the further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid accrued interest is fully reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgment as to the collectability of principal.\nLoans are usually restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.\nNon-performing Loans. At September 30, 2022, $15.1 million, or 1.04% of our total loans, were non-performing loans. The majority of these loans were commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans. Non-performing commercial real estate loans totaled $12.2 million at September 30, 2022. Two loan relationships accounted for $7.9 million of the total non-accrual commercial real estate loans. Non-performing residential first mortgage loans totaled $1.6 million at September 30, 2022.\nReal Estate Owned. At September 30, 2022, the Company had $29,000 of real estate owned consisting of one property. This property is being actively marketed and additional losses may occur.\nNon-Performing Assets. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.\nAt September 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nNon-accrual loans:\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n$\n1,594\n$\n2,865\nConstruction\n-\n-\nCommercial\n1,358\nCommercial real estate\n12,165\n11,124\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\nAuto loans\nOther\nTotal\n15,082\n15,867\nAccruing loans 90 days or more past due:\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n-\n-\nConstruction\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n-\nCommercial real estate\n-\n-\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n-\n-\nAuto Loans\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\nTotal loans 90 days or more past due and accruing\n-\n-\nTotal non-performing loans\n15,082\n15,867\nReal estate owned\nOther repossessed assets\n-\n-\nTotal non-performing assets\n$\n15,111\n$\n16,328\nTroubled Debt Restructurings(1):\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n$\n$\n1,235\nConstruction\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n-\nCommercial real estate\n8,226\n8,420\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\nAuto loans\nOther\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n8,884\n$\n9,713\nRatios:\nTotal non-performing loans to total loans\n1.04\n%\n1.17\n%\nTotal non-performing loans to total assets\n0.81\n%\n0.85\n%\nTotal non-performing assets to total assets\n0.81\n%\n0.88\n%\n(1)\nNon-performing troubled debt restructurings are included in non-accrual loans as part of the non-performing assets table.\nAt September 30, 2022, the principal balance of troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) was $8.8 million as compared to $9.7 million at September 30, 2021. All of the $8.8 million of TDRs at September 30, 2022 were non-accrual loans.\nTDRs at September 30, 2022 were comprised of seven residential loans totaling $620,000, seven commercial real estate loans totaling $8.2 million and four consumer loans (home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, auto and other) totaling $38,000.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, 5 loans totaling $395,000 were removed from TDR status due to the completion of timely payments or paying off the balance.\nThe Company has also granted pandemic-related forbearance for loans that are not defined as a TDR. The one loan relationship still in forbearance at September 30, 2022 included $4.2 million in commercial real estate and $368,000 in commercial loans.\nDelinquencies. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated.

Banking regulations and our Asset Classification Policy provide that loans and other assets considered to be of lesser quality should be classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss assets. An asset is considered Substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as Doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Assets classified as Loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. We classify an asset as Special Mention if the asset has a potential weakness that warrants managements close attention. While such assets are not impaired, management has concluded that if the potential weakness in the asset is not addressed, the value of the asset may deteriorate, thereby adversely affecting the repayment of the asset.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company classified approximately $8.0 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which $7.8 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and $16.5 million as Substandard, of which $14.8 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified Doubtful or Loss. At September 30, 2021, we classified approximately $20.6 million of our assets as Special Mention, of which $20.3 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans, and $26.5 million as Substandard, of which $23.3 million were commercial and commercial real estate loans. No loans were classified as Doubtful or Loss.\nThe loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Not all classified assets constitute non-performing assets.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nOur allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb loan losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable. Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. Our allowance for loan losses consists of two elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, and (2) an unallocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review (at least quarterly) of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. We do not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Loan impairment is measured based on the fair value of collateral method, taking into account the appraised value, any valuation assumptions used, estimated costs to sell and trends in the market since the appraisal date. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, managements judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information to recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on impaired loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2022 is maintained at a level that represents managements best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve Board), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses. The banking regulators may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their analysis and review of information available to them at the time of their examination.\nThe following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.\nAt or For the Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n(Dollars in thousands)\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n18,113\n$\n15,400\nCharge-offs:\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n(19\n)\n(83\n)\nConstruction\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n(209\n)\nCommercial real estate\n(23\n)\n(76\n)\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n-\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n(6\n)\n(9\n)\nAuto loans\n(40\n)\n(274\n)\nOther\n(22\n)\n(1\n)\nTotal charge-offs\n(110\n)\n(652\n)\nRecoveries:\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\nConstruction\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n-\nCommercial real estate\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n-\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\nAuto loans\nOther\n-\n-\nTotal recoveries\nNet recoveries\nProvision for loan losses\n-\n2,700\nBalance at end of year\n$\n18,528\n$\n18,113\nNet charge-offs to average loans outstanding:\nResidential first mortgage loans:\nOne- to four-family\n(0.03\n)%\n(0.02\n)%\nConstruction\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nCommercial\n0.00\n%\n0.02\n%\nCommercial real estate\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nAuto loans\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nOther\n0.00\n%\n0.00\n%\nTotal Net charge-offs\n(0.03\n)%\n(0.00\n)%\nCredit quality ratios:\nAllowance for loan losses to non-performing loans at end\nof year\n122.85\n%\n114.16\n%\nAllowance for loan losses to total loans at end of year\n1.27\n%\n1.33\n%\nSee Non-Performing Loans and Problem Assets.

The following table sets forth the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan category, the percent of the allowance to the total allowance and the percent of loans in each category to total loans at the dates indicated.

The accrual of interest income is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest previously credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgement as to the collectability of principal. Generally, residential and consumer loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt. Commercial loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and ultimate collectability of total contractual principal and interest no longer is in doubt.\nIn our collection efforts, we will first attempt to cure any delinquent loan. If a real estate secured loan is placed on nonaccrual status, it could be subject to transfer to the real estate owned (REO) portfolio (comprised of properties acquired by or in lieu of foreclosure), upon which our credit administration department will pursue the sale of the real estate. Prior to this transfer, the loan balance will be reduced, if necessary, to reflect its current market value less estimated costs to sell. Write downs of REO that occur after the initial transfer from the loan portfolio and costs of holding the property are recorded as other operating expenses, except for significant improvements which are capitalized to the extent that the carrying value does not exceed estimated net realizable value.\nFair values for determining the value of collateral are estimated from various sources, such as real estate appraisals, financial statements and from any other reliable sources of available information. For those loans deemed to be impaired, collateral value is reduced for the estimated costs to sell. Reductions of collateral value are based on historical loss experience, current market data, and any other source of reliable information specific to the collateral.\nThis analysis process is inherently subjective, as it requires us to make estimates that are susceptible to revisions as more information becomes available. Although we believe that we have established the allowance at levels to absorb probable and estimable losses, future additions may be necessary if economic or other conditions in the future differ from the current environment.\nSecurities Activities\nOur securities investment policy is established by our Board of Directors. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management strategy. Our investment policy is reviewed annually by our ALCO/Investment Management Committee. All policy changes recommended by this management committee must be approved by the Board of Directors. The Committee is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Controller, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Banking Officer, Director of Consumer Lending, Chief Risk Officer. Authority to make investments under the approved guidelines is delegated by the Committee to appropriate officers. While general investment strategies are developed and authorized by the ALCO/Investment Management Committee, the execution of specific actions rests with the Chief Financial Officer.\nThe approved investment officers are authorized to execute investment transactions up to $5.0 million per transaction without the prior approval of the ALCO/Investment Management Committee and within the scope of the established investment policy. These officers are also authorized to execute investment transactions between $5.0 million and $10.0 million with the additional approval from the Chief Executive Officer. Each transaction in excess of $10.0 million must receive prior approval of the ALCO/Investment Management Committee.\nOur current investment policy generally permits investments in debt securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. agencies, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and corporate debt obligations, as well as investments in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (federal agency securities) and, to a much lesser extent, other equity securities. Securities in these categories are classified as investment securities for financial reporting purposes. The policy also permits investments in mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities issued and guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) as well as commercial paper. Our current investment strategy uses a risk management approach of diversified investing in fixed-rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities, as well as adjustable-rate securities, which may have a longer term to maturity. The emphasis of this approach is to increase overall investment securities yields while managing interest rate risk.\nOur policy is that, at the time of purchase, we designate a security as held to maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on our ability and intent. Securities that are available-for-sale or held for trading are reported at fair value, while securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost.\nFHLB Securities. We hold Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh (FHLB-Pittsburgh) common stock to qualify for membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to borrow funds under the FHLB advance program. There is no market for the common stock.\nThe aggregate fair value of our FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock as of September 30, 2022 was $14.3 million based on its par value. No unrealized gains or losses have been recorded because we have determined that the par value of the common stock represents its fair value. We owned shares of FHLB-Pittsburgh common stock at September 30, 2022 with a par value that was equal to what we were required to own to maintain our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to be eligible to obtain advances. We are required to purchase additional stock as our outstanding advances increase. Any excess stock we own is redeemed weekly by the FHLB-Pittsburgh.\nEvaluation of Securities Portfolio. We review debt securities with significant declines in fair value on a periodic basis to determine whether they should be considered temporarily or other than temporarily impaired. If a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be other than temporary, we are required to reduce the carrying value of the security to its fair value and record a non-cash, credit related impairment charge in the amount of the decline, net of tax effect, against our current income.\nOur investment securities portfolio contains unrealized losses on securities, including mortgage-related instruments issued or backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government, or generally viewed as having the implied guarantee of the United States government, and debt obligations of a state or political subdivision, corporate obligations, and other debt securities.\nOur policy is to evaluate for other-than-temporary impairment of debt securities where the fair value has been significantly below cost for four consecutive quarters. For fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to interest rates where the Company does not intend to sell the security and it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value, declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary. We review our position quarterly and concluded that at September 30, 2022, declines represent temporary declines due to interest rate change, and we do not intend to sell those securities and it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell those securities before their anticipated recovery in market value.\nPortfolio Maturities and Yields. The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio not carried at fair value at September 30, 2022 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the impact of prepayments or early redemptions that may occur.\nOne Year or Less\nMore than One Year\nthrough Five Years\nMore than Five Years\nthrough Ten Years\nMore than Ten Years\nTotal Securities\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\nAmortized\nCost\nFair\nValue\nWeighted\nAverage\nYield\n(Dollars in thousands)\nInvestment securities held to maturity:\nMortgage-backed securities\n-\n%\n-\n%\n-\n5,515\n%\n1.33\n49,331\n%\n1.74\n54,846\n45,577\n%\n1.60\nU.S. government agency securities\n2,439\n2.03\n-\n-\n2,439\n1,969\n2.03\nTotal investment securities held\nto-maturity\n$\n-\n%\n-\n$\n-\n%\n-\n$\n7,954\n%\n1.54\n$\n49,331\n%\n1.74\n$\n57,285\n$\n47,546\n%\n1.62\nSources of Funds\nGeneral. Deposits, borrowings, repayments and prepayments of loans and securities, proceeds from maturing securities and cash flows from operations are the primary sources of our funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes.\nDeposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms. Our deposit accounts consist of savings accounts, interest bearing demand accounts, checking accounts, money market accounts, club accounts, certificates of deposit and IRAs and other qualified plan accounts. We provide commercial checking accounts for businesses.\nAt September 30, 2022, our deposits totaled $1.4 billion. Interest-bearing demand, savings and club, and money market deposits totaled $956.3 million at September 30, 2022. At September 30, 2022, we had a total of $133.7 million in certificates of deposit. Noninterest-bearing demand deposits totaled $290.1 million.\nOur deposits are obtained predominantly from the areas in which our branch offices are located. We rely on our favorable locations, customer service and competitive pricing to attract and retain these deposits. While we accept certificates of deposit in excess of $100,000 for which we may provide preferential rates, we generally do not solicit such deposits as they are more difficult to retain than core deposits. At September 30, 2022, we had no brokered certificates of deposits, a decrease of $225.0 million from the prior fiscal year end.\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of average deposit accounts, by account type, at the dates indicated.\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\nAverage\nBalance\nPercent\nAverage\nRate\nPaid\nAverage\nBalance\nPercent\nAverage\nRate\nPaid\n(Dollars in thousands)\nDeposit type:\nNoninterest bearing demand accounts\n$\n277,189\n17.80\n%\n-\n%\n$\n264,160\n16.12\n%\n-\n%\nInterest bearing demand accounts\n325,281\n20.88\n%\n0.10\n%\n270,238\n16.49\n%\n0.10\n%\nMoney market\n426,771\n27.40\n%\n0.16\n%\n409,568\n25.00\n%\n0.16\n%\nSavings and club\n197,616\n12.69\n%\n0.05\n%\n178,534\n10.90\n%\n0.05\n%\nCertificates of deposit\n330,657\n21.23\n%\n0.47\n%\n515,937\n31.49\n%\n0.86\n%\nTotal deposits\n$\n1,557,514\n100.00\n%\n0.17\n%\n$\n1,638,437\n100.00\n%\n0.33\n%\nAs of September 30, 2022, the aggregate amount of uninsured deposits (deposits in amounts greater than or equal to $250,000, which is the maximum amount for federal deposit insurance) was $494.6 million. In addition, as of September 30, 2022, the portion of certificates of deposit in excess of the FDIC insurance limit was $14.6 million. The following table sets forth the maturity of those certificates as of September 30, 2022.\nAt\nSeptember 30, 2022\n(In thousands)\nThree months or less\n$\n3,343\nOver three months through six months\n1,340\nOver six months through one year\n5,371\nOver one year\n4,548\nTotal\n$\n14,602\nAt September 30, 2022, $85.5 million of our certificates of deposit had maturities of one year or less.\nBorrowings\nAt September 30, 2022, we had the ability to borrow approximately $756.1 million under our credit facilities with the FHLB-Pittsburgh.\nCompetition\nWe face significant competition in both originating loans and attracting deposits. The counties in which we operate have a significant concentration of financial institutions, many of which are significantly larger institutions and have greater financial resources, and many of which are our competitors to varying degrees. Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, leasing companies, insurance companies and other financial service companies. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from commercial banks, savings banks and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from nondepository competitors such as the mutual fund industry, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies.\nWe seek to meet this competition by the convenience of our branch locations, emphasizing personalized banking, electronic banking solutions and the advantage of local decision-making in our banking business. Specifically, we promote and maintain relationships and build customer loyalty within local communities by focusing our marketing and community involvement on the specific needs of individual neighborhoods. As of September 30, 2022, the Bank had the second largest deposit market share in Monroe County, Pennsylvania. We do not rely on any individual, group, or entity for a material portion of our deposits.\nEmployees and Human Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had 230 full-time employees, and 20 part-time employees. The employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nWe encourage and support the growth and development of our employees and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to employees enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, in compliance with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events employees attend in connection with their job duties.\nThe safety, health and wellness of our employees is a top priority. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a unique challenge with regard to maintaining employee safety while continuing successful operations. Through teamwork and the adaptability of our management and staff, we have been able to transition, many of our employees to working from remote locations and ensure a safely-distanced working environment for employees performing customer facing activities at branches and operations centers. All employees are asked not to come to work when they experience signs or symptoms of a possible COVID-19 illness and have been provided additional paid time off to cover compensation during such absences. On an ongoing basis, we further promote the health and wellness of our employees by strongly encouraging work-life balance, offering flexible work schedules, keeping the employee portion of health care premiums to a minimum and sponsoring various wellness programs.\nEmployee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives, which is being a low-cost provider. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our employees well-being, supporting our employees career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing employees. In addition, nearly all of our employees are stockholders of the Company through participation in our employee stock ownership plan, which aligns associate and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates.\nSubsidiary Activities\nThe Bank has four wholly owned subsidiaries, ESSACOR, Inc., Pocono Investment Company, ESSA Advisory Services, LLC, and Integrated Financial Corporation and its fully owned subsidiary Integrated Abstract Incorporated. ESSACOR, Inc. is a Pennsylvania corporation that has been used to purchase properties at tax sales that represent collateral for delinquent loans of the Bank and is currently inactive. Pocono Investment Company is a Delaware corporation formed as an investment company subsidiary to hold and manage certain investments of the Bank, including certain intellectual property. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company owned by the Bank. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is Pennsylvania limited liability company that is a full-service insurance benefits consulting company offering group services such as health insurance, life insurance, short term and long term disability, dental, vision and 401(k) retirement planning as well as individual health products. Integrated Financial Corporation is a Pennsylvania corporation that provided investment advisory services to the general public and is currently inactive. Integrated Abstract Incorporated is a Pennsylvania corporation that provided title insurance services and is currently inactive.\nSUPERVISION AND REGULATION\nGeneral\nThe Company is a Pennsylvania corporation. As a bank holding company, we are required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board.\nThe Bank is a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC ) under the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). We are subject to extensive regulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities (the Department), our chartering agency, and by the FDIC, our primary federal regulator. We must file reports with the Department and the FDIC concerning our activities and financial condition, in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other savings institutions. There are periodic examinations by the Department and the FDIC to test our compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the DIF and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and with their examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulation, whether by the Department or the FDIC could have a material adverse impact on us and our operations.\nRegulation by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities\nThe Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the Banking Code), contains detailed provisions governing the organization, location of offices, rights and responsibilities of directors, officers, employees, and depositors, as well as corporate powers, savings and investment operations and other aspects of the Bank and its affairs. The Banking Code delegates extensive rulemaking power and administrative discretion to the Department so that the supervision and regulation of state-chartered savings banks may be flexible and readily responsive to changes in economic conditions and in savings and lending practices. The Department may also take enforcement actions against savings banks and may appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank under certain circumstances.\nThe Department generally examines each savings bank not less frequently than once every two years. Although the Department may accept the examinations and reports of the FDIC in lieu of the Departments examination, the current practice is for the Department to conduct individual examinations. The Department may order any savings bank to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound business practice and may direct any trustee, officer, attorney, or employee of a savings bank engaged in an objectionable activity, after the Department has ordered the activity to be terminated, to show cause at a hearing before the Department why such person should not be removed.\nRegulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nThe Bank is also subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the FDIC, as its primary federal regulator. Such regulation and supervision:\nlimits the activities and investment authority of the Bank;\nestablishes a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with the Banks safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods;\nestablishes various capital categories resulting in various levels of regulatory scrutiny applied to the institutions in a particular category; and\nestablishes standards for safety and soundness.\nThe FDIC is required by law to examine each regulated institution every twelve months, subject to an exception for institutions of less than $3 billion of total assets that satisfy certain other criteria, which are on an eighteen-month examination schedule. The FDIC has the authority to order any savings bank and its directors, officers, attorneys or employees to discontinue any violation of law or unsafe or unsound banking practice.\nFederal law and FDIC regulations generally limit the activities as principal and investments of state-chartered FDIC insured banks and their subsidiaries to those permissible for national banks and their subsidiaries, unless such activities and investments are specifically exempted by law or consented to by the FDIC.\nBefore engaging in a new activity as principal that is not permissible for a national bank or otherwise permissible under federal law or FDIC regulations, an insured savings bank must seek approval from the FDIC to engage in such activity. The FDIC will not approve the activity unless the savings bank meets its minimum capital requirements, and the FDIC determines that the activity does not present a significant risk to the DIF. Certain activities of subsidiaries that are engaged in activities permitted for national banks only through a financial subsidiary are subject to additional restrictions. Although the Bank meets all conditions necessary to establish and engage in permitted activities through financial subsidiaries, it has not chosen to engage in such activities.\nTransactions with Affiliates\nTransactions between an insured bank, such as the Bank, and any of its affiliates are governed by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and implementing regulations. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. Generally, a subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or financial subsidiary is not treated as an affiliate of the bank under Sections 23A and 23B but instead is considered part of the bank for purposes of the applicable limits and requirements.\nSection 23A:\nlimits the extent to which a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such banks capital stock and retained earnings, and limits all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and retained earnings; and\nrequires that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices.\nThe term covered transaction includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and similar transactions. Most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the loan amounts, depending on the type of collateral. In addition, any covered transaction by a bank with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by a bank from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank, as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate\nInsurance of Accounts and Regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nDeposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDICs DIF generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per depositor for each account ownership category.\nThe FDIC charges insured depository institutions risk-based assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institutions total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. Assessments for most banks are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure over three years. The assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) for institutions of the Banks size is 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.\nThe FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, except that no adjustment can be made without notice and comment rulemaking. The FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking in June 2022 and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points, beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023 (i.e., January 1 through March 31, 2023). No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.\nInsurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Bank does not believe that it is taking or is subject to any action, condition or violation that could lead to termination of its deposit insurance.\nCapital Requirements\nFederal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets, and a Tier 1 capital to total adjusted assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.\nThe capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively, and a leverage ratio of at least 4% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). The Bank elected to opt out of this requirement. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.\nIn determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one- to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.\nIn addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements capital, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a capital conservation buffer consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. A banks failure to achieve the capital conservation buffer will result in restrictions on paying dividends, engaging in stock repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses.\nInstitutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that meet certain other requirements (including off-balance sheet exposure of 25% or less of total assets and trading assets and liabilities of 5% or less of total assets) may elect to use the optional community bank leverage ratio framework, which requires maintaining a leverage ratio of greater than 8.5% for calendar year 2021 and 9% thereafter. Eligible institutions with a capital level meeting or exceeding the specified requirement and electing to use the community bank leverage ratio framework are considered to comply with the applicable regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to either comply with the community bank leverage ratio requirements or comply with the general capital regulations, including the risk-based capital requirements. The Bank did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio framework as of September 30, 2022.\nIn assessing an institutions capital adequacy, the FDIC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where deemed necessary.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Banks capital exceeded all applicable requirements.\nAny state-chartered savings bank that fails any of the capital requirements is subject to possible enforcement actions by the FDIC. Such actions could include a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on an institutions operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver. Certain corrective actions are required by law, as described further under Prompt Corrective Action.\nWe are also subject to capital regulations of the Department which generally incorporate federal leverage and risk-based capital requirements.\nDividends from ESSA Bank & Trust\nOur ability to pay dividends depends, to a large extent, upon the Banks ability to pay dividends to the Company. The Banking Code states that no dividend may be paid out of surplus without approval of the Department. Dividends may be paid out of accumulated net earnings. No dividend may generally be paid that would result in the Bank failing to comply with its regulatory capital requirements.\nPrompt Corrective Action\nUnder the federal Prompt Corrective Action regulations, a savings bank is deemed to be (i) well capitalized if it has total risk-based capital of 10.0% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or more and is not subject to any written capital order or directive; (ii) adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or more, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or more, a Tier I leverage capital ratio of 4.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or more, and does not meet the definition of well capitalized; (iii) undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.5%, (iv) significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier I risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, a Tier I leverage capital ratio that is less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3%; and (v) critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. Federal regulations also specify circumstances under which a federal banking agency may reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category (except that the FDIC may not reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized).\nGenerally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator within specific time frames for a savings bank that becomes critically undercapitalized. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The holding company for a savings bank required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of a savings banks assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. The guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to certain mandatory restrictions, including on capital distributions and growth. Significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional restrictions. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against an undercapitalized savings bank, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.\nThe Prompt Corrective categories discussed above were effective January 1, 2015 and reflect the revised regulatory capital requirements effective the same date. The final rule establishing the community bank leverage ratio provides that an institution electing and complying with that alternative regulatory capital framework is considered to be well capitalized under the Prompt Corrective Actions regulations.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Bank was a well-capitalized institution under the Prompt Corrective Action regulations.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act\nUnder the Community Reinvestment Act (the CRA), every insured depository institution, including the Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the FDIC to assess the depository institutions record of meeting the credit needs of its community and consider that record in its consideration of certain applications by the institution, such as for a merger or the establishment of a branch office. The FDIC may use an unsatisfactory CRA examination rating as the basis for denying such an application. The Bank received a Needs to Improve CRA rating from the FDIC in its most recent CRA evaluation.\nOn May 5, 2022, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the CRA regulations and the related regulatory framework.\nThe USA PATRIOT Act\nThe USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if we engage in a merger or other acquisition, our controls designed to combat money\nlaundering would be considered as part of the application process. We have established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.\nHolding Company Regulation\nThe Company is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company and is subject to examination, regulation and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Bank Holding Company Act), as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted capital adequacy regulations for bank holding companies on a consolidated basis. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary institutions apply to bank holding companies with $3 billion or more in consolidated assets. Bank holding companies with under $3 billion of consolidated assets, including the Company, are not subject to the consolidated requirements unless otherwise directed by the Federal Reserve Board.\nRegulations of the Federal Reserve Board provide that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to any of its subsidiary banks and must not conduct its activities in an unsafe or unsound manner. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and required the issuance of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank must guarantee, within limitations, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or to implement an accepted plan, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying any dividend or making any other form of capital distribution. In addition, Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the Companys net income for the past year is consistent with the Companys capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.\nA bank holding company is required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the Companys consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. Such notice and approval is not required for a bank holding company that is well capitalized under applicable regulations of the Federal Reserve Board, has received at least an overall satisfactory composite rating, as well as satisfactory rating for management, at its most recent bank holding company examination by the Federal Reserve Board, and that is not the subject of any unresolved supervisory issues. In addition, Federal Reserve Board guidance provides for agency prior review of bank holding company dividends and stock redemptions and repurchases in certain circumstances, which may affect our ability to pay dividends, or engage in redemptions or repurchases.\nAs a financial holding company, we are permitted (1) to engage in other activities that the Federal Reserve Board determines to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally, or (2) to acquire shares of companies engaged in such activities. We may not, however, directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting shares, or substantially all of the assets, of a bank holding company or a bank without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board.\nIn order to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we must remain well capitalized and well managed under applicable regulations and maintain a satisfactory or better rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. Failure to meet one or more of the requirements would mean, depending on the requirements not met, that we could not undertake new activities, make acquisitions other than those permitted generally for bank holding companies, or continue certain activities.\nRegulatory Enforcement Authority\nFederal law provides federal banking regulators with substantial enforcement powers. This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease-and-desist and removal orders, and initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution-affiliated parties, as defined. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities.\nFederal Securities Laws\nShares of the Companys common stock are registered with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). The Company is also subject to the proxy rules, tender offer rules, insider trading restrictions, annual and periodic reporting, and other requirements of the Exchange Act.\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is intended to improve corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The Company has policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act)\nThe CARES Act, which became law on March 27, 2020, provided over $2 trillion to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) and stimulate the economy. The CARES Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act provided $659 billion to fund loans by depository institutions to eligible small businesses through the Small Business Administrations (SBA) 7(a) loan guaranty program. These loans are 100% federally guaranteed (principal and interest). An eligible business could apply under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) during the applicable covered period and receive a loan up to 2.5 times its average monthly payroll costs limited to a loan amount of $10.0 million. The proceeds of the loan could be used for payroll (excluding individual employee compensation over $100,000 per year), mortgage, interest, rent, insurance, utilities and other qualifying expenses. PPP loans have: (a) an interest rate of 1.0%, (b) a two-year loan term (or five-year loan term for loans made after June 5, 2021) to maturity; and (c) principal and interest payments deferred until the date on which the SBA remits the loan forgiveness amount to the borrowers lender or, alternatively, notifies the lender no loan forgiveness is allowed. If the borrower did not submit a loan forgiveness application to the lender within 10 months following the end of the 24-week loan forgiveness covered period (or the 8-week loan forgiveness covered period with respect to loans made prior to June 5, 2021 if such covered period is elected by the borrower), the borrower would begin paying principal and interest on the PPP loan immediately after the 10-month period. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrowers PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be fully reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as, during the applicable loan forgiveness covered period, employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and 60% of the loan proceeds are used for payroll expenses, with the remaining 40% of the loan proceeds used for other qualifying expenses. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021, though existing borrowers may still be eligible for loan forgiveness. As of September 30, 2022 the Company had eleven PPP loans totaling $702,000, compared to 180 PPP loans totaling $22.6 million as of September 30, 2021.\nFEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION\nFederal Taxation\nGeneral. ESSA Bancorp and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to ESSA Bancorp and the Bank.\nMethod of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, ESSA Bancorp currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending September 30 for filing its consolidated federal income tax returns. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for bad debt reserves by savings institutions, effective for taxable years beginning after 1995.\nBad Debt Reserves. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts for tax purposes and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at the Banks taxable income. As a result of the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, the Bank must use the specific charge off method in computing its bad debt deduction for tax purposes.\nTaxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to the Small Business Protection Act of 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if the Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definition tests. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated these thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 reserves remain subject to tax recapture should the Bank make certain distributions from its tax bad debt reserve or cease to maintain a financial institution charter. At September 30, 2022, the Banks total federal pre-1988 reserve was approximately $4.6 million. This reserve reflects the cumulative effects of federal tax deductions by the Bank for which no federal income tax provision has been made.\nMinimum Tax. The alternative minimum tax for corporations has been repealed for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Any unused minimum tax credit of a corporation may be used to offset regular tax liability for any tax year. In addition, a\nportion of unused minimum tax credit was refundable in 2018 through 2021. The refundable portion is 100% for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2018 of the excess of the minimum tax credit for the year over any credit allowable against regular tax for that year. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had a $139,000 minimum tax credit carryforward.\nNet Operating Loss Carryovers. Effective with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, net operating loss carrybacks are no longer permitted, and net operating losses are allowed to be carried forward indefinitely. Net operating loss carryforwards arising from tax years beginning after January 1, 2018 are limited to offset a maximum of 80% of a future years taxable income. At September 30, 2022, the Bank had no net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes.\nCorporate Dividends. We may exclude from our income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.\nAudit of Tax Returns. ESSA Bancorps federal income tax returns have not been audited in the most recent three-year period. The 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021 tax years remain open. The tax returns filed for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2020 and 2021 represents tax years 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively. The Company has not yet filed its tax return for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 which represents the 2021 tax year.\nState Taxation\nESSA Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax. The Corporation Net Income Tax rate for fiscal year 2022 is 9.99% and is imposed on unconsolidated taxable income for federal purposes with certain adjustments. The Bank is subject to tax under the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax Act, as amended to include thrift institutions having capital stock. Pursuant to the Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, the tax rate is 11.5%. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax exempts the Bank from other taxes imposed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for state income tax purposes and from all local taxation imposed by political subdivisions, except taxes on real estate and real estate transfers. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax is a tax upon net earnings or income received or accrued from all sources during the year, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments. The Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax, in computing income according to generally accepted accounting principles, allows for the deduction of interest earned on state and federal obligations, while disallowing a percentage of thrifts interest expense deduction in the proportion of interest income on those securities to the overall interest income of the Bank. Net operating losses, if any, thereafter, can be carried forward three years for Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax purposes. Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nIn addition to factors discussed in the description of our business and elsewhere in this report, the following are factors that could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.\nEconomic and Market Area\nChanges in economic conditions, in particular an economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could materially and negatively affect our business.\nOur business is directly impacted by factors such as economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in industry and finance, legislative and regulatory changes, changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation, all of which are beyond our control. Any deterioration in economic conditions, whether caused by national or local concerns, in particular any further economic slowdown in the markets we operate in, could result in the following consequences, any of which could hurt our business materially: loan delinquencies may increase; problem assets and foreclosures may increase; demand for our products and services may decrease; low cost or non-interest bearing deposits may decrease; and collateral for loans made by us, especially real estate, may decline in value, in turn reducing customers borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our existing loans.\nOur success significantly depends upon the growth in population, income levels, deposits, and housing starts in our markets. If the communities in which we operate do not grow or if prevailing economic conditions locally or nationally are unfavorable, our business may not succeed. An economic downturn or prolonged recession may result in the deterioration of the quality of our loan portfolio and reduce our level of deposits, which in turn would hurt its business. If we experience an economic downturn or a prolonged economic recession occurs in the economy as a whole, borrowers will be less likely to repay their loans as scheduled. Unlike many larger institutions, we are not able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. An economic downturn could, therefore, result in losses that materially and adversely affect our business.\nInflationary pressures and rising prices may affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nInflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has continued rising in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, a prolonged period of inflation could cause wages and other costs to the Company to increase, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to pose risks and could harm our business, our results of operations and the prospects of the Company.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted the global and national economy and certain industries and geographies in which our clients operate. Given its ongoing and dynamic nature, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the business of the Company, its clients, employees and third-party service providers. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain. Additionally, the responses of various governmental and nongovernmental authorities and consumers to the pandemic may have material long-term effects on the Company and its clients which are difficult to quantify in the near-term or long-term.\nConcentration of Loans in Our Primary Market Area May Increase the Risk of Increased Nonperforming Assets.\nOur success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the Pennsylvania counties of Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery as nearly all of our loans are to customers in these markets. Accordingly, the local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on the ability of borrowers to repay loans as well as our ability to originate new loans. As such, decline in real estate values in these market areas would also lower the value of the collateral securing loans on properties in these market areas. In addition, weakening in general economic conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could negatively affect our financial results.\nStrong Competition Within Our Market Areas May Limit Our Growth and Profitability.\nCompetition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market areas, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, and brokerage and investment banking firms operating locally and elsewhere. Some of our competitors have greater name recognition and market presence that benefit them in attracting business, and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, larger competitors may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively than we do, which could affect our ability to grow and remain profitable on a long-term basis. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market areas. For additional information see Item 1. Business-Competition.\nThe Soundness of Other Financial Services Institutions May Adversely Affect Our Credit Risk.\nWe rely on other financial services institutions through trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We maintain limits and monitor concentration levels of our counterparties as specified in our internal policies. Our reliance on other financial services institutions exposes us to credit risk in the event of default by these institutions or counterparties. These losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges to LIBOR may adversely impact the value of, and the return on, our loans, investment securities and derivatives which are indexed to LIBOR.\nICE Benchmark Administration, the authorized and regulated administrator of LIBOR, ended publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors on December 31, 2021 and the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will end publication in June 2023. Financial services regulators and industry groups have collaborated to develop alternate reference rate indices or reference rates. The transition to a new reference rate requires changes to contracts, risk and pricing models, valuation tools, systems, product design and hedging strategies.\nUncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the elimination or replacement of LIBOR, or other reforms may adversely affect the value of, and the return on our loans, and our investment securities.\nInterest Rate and Asset Quality\nFuture Changes in Interest Rates Could Reduce Our Profits.\nOur ability to make a profit largely depends on our net interest income, which could be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\n1.\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n2.\nthe interest expense we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of times. Like many banks, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility, as market interest rates change over time. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest paid on our liabilities, as borrowers speed up prepayments of mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income earned on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest paid on our liabilities. Furthermore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our ability to originate loans and/or the ability of our borrowers to make loan repayments on adjustable-rate loans, as the interest owed on such loans would increase as interest rates increase.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A reduction in interest rates results in increased prepayments of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities, as borrowers refinance their loans in order to reduce their borrowing costs. This creates reinvestment risk, which is the risk that we may not be able to reinvest prepayments at rates that are comparable to the rates we earned on the prepaid loans or securities. Alternatively, increases in interest rates may decrease loan demand and/or make it more difficult for borrowers to repay adjustable rate loans.\nChanges in interest rates also affect the current market value of our interest-earning securities portfolio. Generally, the value of securities moves inversely with changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2022, the fair value of our investment securities available for sale totaled $208.6 million. Unrealized net losses on these available for sale securities totaled approximately $17.6 million at September 30, 2022 and are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity. Decreases in the fair value of securities available for sale in future periods would have an adverse effect on stockholders equity.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity by estimating the change in the Banks Economic Value of Equity (EVE) over a range of interest rate scenarios. EVE is the net present value of the Companys asset cash flows minus the net present value of the Companys liability cash flows. At September 30, 2022, in the event of an immediate 200 basis point increase in interest rates, the Companys model projects that we would experience a $13.3 million, or 3.2%, decrease in net portfolio value. See Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\nA significant portion of our assets consists of investment securities, which generally have lower yields than loans, and we classify a significant portion of our investment securities as available for sale, which creates potential volatility in our equity and may have an adverse impact on our net income.\nAs of September 30, 2022, our securities portfolio totaled $265.9 million, or 14.3% of our total assets. Investment securities typically have lower yields than loans. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the weighted average yield of our investment securities portfolio was 2.78%, as compared to 4.07% for our loan portfolio.\nAccordingly, our net interest margin is lower than it would have been if a higher proportion of our interest-earning assets consisted of loans. Additionally, at September 30, 2022, $208.6 million, or 78.5% of our investment securities, are classified as available for sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains or losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income, which affects our reported equity. Accordingly, given the significant size of the investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale and due to possible mark-to-market adjustments of that portion of the portfolio resulting from market conditions, we may experience greater volatility in the value of reported equity. Moreover, given that we actively manage our investment securities portfolio classified as available for sale, we may sell securities which could result in a realized loss, thereby reducing our net income.\nOur Continued Emphasis on Commercial Real Estate Lending Increases Our Exposure to Increased Lending Risks.\nOur business strategy centers on continuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending. We have grown our loan portfolio in recent years with respect to this type of loan and intend to continue to emphasize this type of lending. At September 30, 2022, $678.8 million, or 46.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans\nbecause repayment of the commercial real estate loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting policies, which require such loans to be qualified on the basis of the propertys collateral value, net income and debt service ratio; however, there is no assurance that our underwriting policies will protect us from credit-related losses.\nAt September 30, 2022, our largest commercial real estate lending relationship was $17.8 million of loans located in Lehigh County, Pennsylvania and secured by real estate. These loans were performing in accordance with its repayment terms. See Item 1. Business-Lending Activities-Commercial Real Estate Loans.\nIncreases to the Allowance for Credit Losses May Cause Our Earnings to Decrease.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral securing the payment of those loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. In addition, the estimates used to determine the fair value of such loans as of the acquisition date may be inconsistent with the actual performance of the acquired loans. Hence, we may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses, we rely on loan quality reviews, past loss experience, and an evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease our net income.\nOur emphasis on the origination of commercial real estate and business loans is one of the more significant factors in evaluating our allowance for credit losses. As we continue to increase the amount of these loans, additional or increased provisions for credit losses may be necessary and as a result would decrease our earnings.\nRegulatory Matters\nA new accounting standard may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard that will be effective for our first fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nBank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and/or financial condition.\nWe Operate in a Highly Regulated Environment and May Be Adversely Affected by Changes in Laws and Regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Department. Such regulators govern the activities in which we may engage, primarily for the protection of depositors. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of a bank, the classification of assets by a bank, the imposition of higher capital requirements, and the adequacy of a banks allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, or legislation, could have a material impact on us and our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects.\nSecurity\nRisks Associated with System Failures, Interruptions, Or Breaches of Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities investments, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches (including privacy breaches), but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource a majority of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any system failures, interruption, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Associated with Cyber-Security Could Negatively Affect Our Earnings.\nThe financial services industry has experienced an increase in both the number and severity of reported cyber-attacks aimed at gaining unauthorized access to bank systems as a way to misappropriate assets and sensitive information, corrupt and destroy data, or cause operational disruptions.\nWe have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of security breaches, but such events may still occur or may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. Although we rely on security safeguards to secure our data, these safeguards may not fully protect our systems from compromises or breaches.\nWe also rely on the integrity and security of a variety of third-party processors, payment, clearing and settlement systems, as well as the various participants involved in these systems, many of which have no direct relationship with us. Failure by these participants or their systems to protect our customers transaction data may put us at risk for possible losses due to fraud or operational disruption.\nOur customers are also the target of cyber-attacks and identity theft. Large scale identity theft could result in customers accounts being compromised and fraudulent activities being performed in their name. We have implemented certain safeguards against these types of activities but they may not fully protect us from fraudulent financial losses.\nThe occurrence of a breach of security involving our customers information, regardless of its origin, could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, and could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Item 1B.\nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2.\nProperties\nAt September 30, 2022, the Company and the Bank conducted our business through 21 full-service branch offices located in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties, Pennsylvania. We own 13 properties and lease 12 properties inclusive of the 21 full service-branch offices referred to above.\nThe net book value of our premises, land and equipment was $13.1 million at September 30, 2022. Item 3.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nThe Bank was named as a defendant in an action commenced on December 8, 2016 by one plaintiff who sought to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiff alleges that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks in the process of making loans, in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In an order dated January 29, 2018, the district court granted the Banks motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff appealed the courts ruling. In an opinion and order dated April 26, 2019, the appellate court reversed the district courts order dismissing the plaintiffs case against the Bank and remanded the case back to the district court in order to continue the litigation. The litigation is now proceeding before the district court. On December 9, 2019, the court permitted an amendment to the complaint to add two new plaintiffs to the case asserting similar claims. On May 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification. In an order dated November 24, 2020, the court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge to assist in mediation efforts. The case was stayed while the parties explored the potential for a negotiated resolution. The parties engaged in mediation but did not resolve the matter. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable.\nOn May 29, 2020, the Bank was named as a defendant in a second action commenced by three plaintiffs who also seek to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The Bank moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable. Item 4.Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5.\nMarket for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe Companys shares of common stock are traded on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol ESSA. The approximate number of holders of record of ESSA Bancorps common stock as of September 30, 2022 was 1,656. Certain shares of ESSA Bancorp are held in nominee or street name and accordingly, the number of beneficial owners of such shares is not known or included in the foregoing number.\nThe Board of Directors has the authority to declare cash dividends on shares of common stock, subject to statutory and regulatory requirements.

Item 6.\n[Reserved] Item 7.\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Strategy\nOur business strategy is to grow and improve our profitability by:\nIncreasing customer relationships through the offering of excellent service and the distribution of that service through effective delivery systems;\nContinuing to transform into a full service community bank by meeting the financial services needs of our customers;\nContinuing to develop into a high performing financial institution, in part by increasing net interest and fee income and managing operating expenses efficiently;\nRemaining within our risk management parameters; and\nEmploying affordable technology to increase profitability and improve customer service.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy, subject to changes necessitated by future market conditions and other factors. We also intend to continue focusing on the following:\nIncreasing customer relationships through a continued commitment to service and enhancing products and delivery systems. We will continue to increase customer relationships by focusing on customer satisfaction with regard to service, products, systems and operations. We have upgraded and expanded certain of our facilities, including our corporate center and added additional facilities to provide additional capacity to manage future growth and expand our delivery systems.\nContinuing to develop into a high performing financial institution. We will continue to enhance profitability by focusing on increasing non-interest income as well as increasing commercial products, including commercial real estate lending, which often have a higher profit margin than more traditional products. We also will pursue lower-cost commercial deposits as part of this strategy.\nRemaining within our risk management parameters. We place significant emphasis on risk management and compliance training for all of our directors, officers and employees. We focus on establishing regulatory compliance programs to determine the degree of such compliance and to maintain the trust of our customers and community.\nEmploying cost-effective technology to increase profitability and improve customer service. We will continue to upgrade our technology in an efficient manner. We have implemented new software for marketing purposes and have upgraded both our internal and external communication systems.\nContinuing our emphasis on commercial real estate lending to improve our overall performance. We intend to continue to emphasize the origination of higher interest rate margin commercial real estate loans as market conditions, regulations and other factors permit. We have expanded our commercial banking capabilities by adding experienced commercial bankers, and enhancing our direct marketing efforts to local businesses.\nExpanding our banking franchise through branching and acquisitions. We will attempt to use our stock holding company structure to expand our market footprint through de novo branching as well as through additional acquisitions of banks, savings institutions and other financial service providers in our primary market area. We will also consider establishing de novo branches or acquiring additional financial institutions in contiguous counties. We will continue to review and assess locations for new branches both within Monroe County and the counties around Monroe. There can be no assurance that we will be able to consummate any new acquisitions or establish any additional new branches. We may continue to explore acquisition opportunities involving other banks and thrifts, and possibly financial service companies, when and as they arise, as a means of supplementing internal growth, filling gaps in our current geographic market area and expanding our customer base, product lines and internal capabilities, although we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make any acquisitions.\nMaintaining the quality of our loan portfolio. Maintaining the quality of our loan portfolio is a key factor in managing our growth. We will continue to use customary risk management techniques, such as independent internal and external loan reviews, risk-focused portfolio credit analysis and field inspections of collateral in overseeing the performance of our loan portfolio.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income, to be critical accounting policies. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies:\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and has identified this policy as one of our most critical. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved, the subjectivity of the assumptions utilized and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses.\nAs a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans.\nManagement performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including, but not limited to, current economic conditions, delinquency statistics, geographic and industry concentrations, the adequacy of the underlying collateral, the financial strength of the borrower, results of internal and external loan reviews and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions.\nThe analysis of the allowance for loan losses has two components: specific and general allocations. Specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to be impaired. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses. The general allocation is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan, risk weighting (if applicable) and payment history. We also analyze historical loss experience, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and geographic and industry concentrations. This analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general allocations. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but it is tested at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. If the estimated current fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. The Company uses market capitalization and multiples of tangible book value methods to determine the estimated current fair value of its reporting unit. Based on this analysis, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nThe other intangibles assets are assigned useful lives, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their weighted-average lives. The Company periodically reviews the intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Based on these reviews, no impairment was recorded in fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\nEmployee Benefit Plans. The Bank maintains a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan for all employees who have met age and length of service requirements. The Bank also maintains a defined contribution Section 401(k) plan covering eligible employees. The Company created an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis.\nThe Company maintains an equity incentive plan to provide for issuance or granting of shares of common stock for stock options or restricted stock. The Company has recorded stock-based employee compensation cost using the fair value method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. Management estimated the fair values of all option grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management estimated the expected life of the options using the simplified method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. The risk-free rate was determined utilizing the treasury yield for the expected life of the option contract.\nFair Value Measurements. We group our assets at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:\nLevel I - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel II - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.\nLevel III - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Companys own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset.\nWe base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in generally accepted accounting principles.\nFair value measurements for most of our assets are obtained from independent pricing services that we have engaged for this purpose. When available, we, or our independent pricing service, use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that incorporate available trade, bid, and other market information. Subsequently, all of our financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. In certain cases, however, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, that could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations.\nOther-than-Temporary Investment Security Impairment. Securities are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is other-than-temporary. Management utilizes criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, in addition to the reasons underlying the decline, to determine whether the loss in value is other-than-temporary. The term other-than-temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent, but indicates that the prospect for a near-term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment. Once a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nDeferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. We consider the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy because of the need to exercise significant judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets, including projections of future taxable income. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. A valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amount of taxes recoverable through loss carryback declines, or if we project lower levels of future taxable income. Such a valuation allowance would be established through a charge to income tax expense which would adversely affect our operating results.\nComparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nTotal Assets. Total assets increased $381,000, or 0.02%, to $1.9 billion at September 30, 2022, compared to September 30, 2021.\nCash and Due from Banks. Cash and due from banks decreased $126.9 million, or 86.4%, to $20.0 million at September 30, 2022 from $146.8 million at September 30, 2021. The primary reason for the decrease was an increase in loans receivable.\nInterest-Bearing Deposits with Other Institutions. Interest-bearing deposits with other institutions decreased $4.1 million, or 34.2%, to $8.0 million at September 30, 2022 from $12.1 million at September 30, 2021.\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale and Held to Maturity. Investment securities available for sale decreased $31.9 million, or 13.3%, to $208.6 million at September 30, 2022 from $240.6 million at September 30, 2021. The decrease was due primarily to decreases in US government Treasury securities of $100.0 million, obligations of states and political subdivisions of $3.3 million and other debt securities of $3.5 million, which were offset in part by increases in US government agency securities of $7.3 million, US government mortgage backed securities of $55.1 million, and corporate securities of $12.5 million. The Company had $54.8 million in US government mortgage backed securities and $2.4 million of US government agency securities which were classified as held to maturity at September 30, 2022.\nNet Loans. Net loans increased $94.9 million, or 7.1%, to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022 from September 30, 2021. The primary reasons for the increase were increases in residential real estate loans, construction loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other loans, offset in part by decreases in commercial loans, obligations of states and political subdivisions and auto loans. Commercial real estate loans increased by $87.7 million to $678.8 million at September 30, 2022 from $591.1 million at September 30, 2021. Commercial loans decreased $25.3 million to $38.2 million at September 30, 2022 from $63.5 million at September 30, 2021 due primarily to declines in PPP loans of $21.9 million. Obligations of states and political subdivisions decreased by $15.7 million to $40.4 million at September 30, 2022 from $56.2 million at September 30, 2021. One- to four-family loans increased by $43.1 million to $623.4 million at September 30, 2022 from $580.3 million at September 30, 2021. The Company paused its sales of one- to four-family mortgage loans to the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh during the fiscal first quarter of the year due to increasing interest rates. Home equity loans and lines of credit increased by $4.7 million to $43.2 million at September 30, 2022 from $38.4 million at September 30, 2021. Auto loans decreased $10.2 million to $3.6 million at September 30, 2022 from $13.9 million at September 30, 2021. The Company discontinued indirect auto lending in July 2018.\nDeposits. Deposits decreased by $256.1 million, or 15.6%, to $1.4 billion at September 30, 2022, primarily as a result of decreases in interest bearing demand accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit partially offset by increases in savings accounts and non-interest bearing demand accounts. Noninterest bearing demand accounts were $290.1 million, up 12.5% from September 30, 2021. Interest bearing demand accounts declined to $357.5 million from September 30, 2021 as the Bank shifted $225.0 million in brokered deposits to FHLB advances to take advantage of lower interest rates. Money market accounts were $402.1 million at September 30, 2022, down 6.1% from September 30, 2021. Certificates of deposit declined to $133.7 million from $209.9 million at September 30, 2021.\nBorrowed Funds. Borrowed funds, short term and other, increased to $230.8 million at September 30, 2022 from no borrowed funds at September 30, 2021 as the Company shifted funding from brokered deposits. All borrowed funds are from the FHLB.\nStockholders Equity. Stockholders equity increased by $10.5 million, or 5.2%, to $212.3 million at September 30, 2022 from $201.8 million at September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to net income of $20.1 million partially offset by other comprehensive loss of $3.6 million, cash dividends paid of $5.3 million and common stock repurchases of $1.9 million.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nNet Income. Net income increased by $3.6 million, or 22.2%, to $20.1 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022 from $16.4 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest expense, a decrease in the provision for loan losses and an increase in interest income partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income, increase in non-interest expense and an increase in income taxes.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income increased by $6.9 million, or 13.0%, to $59.8 million for fiscal year 2022 from $52.9 million for fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the decreases in interest expense from deposits and short-term borrowings, and an increase in total interest income.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased $4.1 million, or 7.0%, to $62.8 million for fiscal year 2022 from $58.7 million for fiscal year 2021. The increase resulted from an increase of 28 basis points in the overall yield on interest earning assets to 3.56% from 3.28%, which had the effect of increasing interest income by $3.5 million along with a decrease of $21.2 million in average interest earning assets, which had the effect of increasing interest income by $663,000. The decrease in average interest earning assets during 2022 compared to 2021 included decreases in average loans receivable of $18.4 million and other assets of $66.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by increases in average mortgage backed securities of $45.6 million, average FHLB stock of $3.1 million and average investment securities of $14.6 million. The average yield on loans increased to 4.07% for the fiscal year 2022, from 3.91% for the fiscal year 2021. The average yields on investment securities remained at 2.78% and the average yields on mortgage backed securities increased to 2.04% for 2022 from 1.55% for the 2021 period.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $2.8 million, or 47.5%, to $3.0 million for fiscal year 2022 from $5.8 million for fiscal year 2021. The decrease in interest expense resulted from a 19 basis point decrease in the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities to 0.23% for fiscal 2022 from 0.42% for fiscal 2021 which had the effect of decreasing interest expense by $1.7 million along with a decrease in average interest bearing liabilities which had the effect of decreasing interest expense by $1.1 million. For fiscal 2022, average borrowed funds increased $45.4 million compared to fiscal 2021. Average savings and club accounts increased by $19.1 million, average interest bearing demand deposit accounts increased $55.0 million, average money market accounts increased $17.2 million and average certificates of deposit decreased $185.3 million. The cost of money market accounts remained at 0.16% for fiscal year 2022. The cost of interest bearing demand deposit accounts remained at 0.10% for fiscal year 2022. The cost of savings and club accounts remained at 0.05% for fiscal 2022. The cost of certificates of deposit decreased to 0.47% from 0.87% and the cost of borrowed funds decreased to 0.61% from 1.48% for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The Company establishes provisions for loan losses, which are charged to earnings, at a level necessary to absorb known and inherent losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. In evaluating the level of the allowance for loan losses, management considers historical loss experience, the types of loans and the amount of loans in the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, peer group information and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available or as future events occur. After an evaluation of these factors, the Company made no loan loss provision for fiscal year 2022 compared to a $2.7 million provision for the 2021 fiscal year. The allowance for loan losses was $18.5 million, or 1.27% of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2022, compared to $18.1 million, or 1.33% of loans outstanding, at September 30, 2021.\nDetermining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment. Management reviews the level of the allowance on a quarterly basis, and establishes the provision for loan losses based on the factors set forth in the preceding paragraph. Historically, the Banks loan portfolio has consisted primarily of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. However, our current business plan calls for increases in commercial real estate loan originations. As management evaluates the allowance for loan losses, the increased risk associated with larger non-homogenous commercial real estate may result in large additions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods. Loans secured by commercial real estate generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful operation of the property and the income stream of the underlying property. Additionally, such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan.\nAlthough we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses, future additions to the allowance may be necessary, based on estimates that are susceptible to change as a result of changes in economic conditions and other factors. In addition, the FDIC, as an integral part of its examination process, will periodically review our allowance for loan losses. This agency may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance, based on its judgments about information available to it at the time of its examination.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $3.0 million, or 26.0%, to $8.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, from $11.5 million for the comparable 2021 period. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in gain on sale of investments, net of $460,000, gain on sale of loans, net of $1.9 million, service charges and fees on loans of $35,000, loan swap fees of $341,000, earnings on bank owned life insurance of $95,000, insurance commissions of $70,000 and other noninterest income of $147,000. Gain on sale of loans declined as the Company paused sales of one-to-four family residential mortgages due to increasing interest rates. These decreases were offset, in part, by increases in service fees on deposit accounts of $6,000 and trust and investment fees of $105,000.\nNon-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $1.5 million, or 3.6%, to $43.3 million for fiscal year 2022 from $41.8 million for the comparable period in 2021. The primary reasons for the increase in noninterest expense were increases in compensation and employee benefits of $330,000, occupancy and equipment of $161,000, professional fees of $1.4 million, data processing of $141,000, advertising of $131,000 and a decrease in gain on foreclosed real estate of $466,000. These increases were partially offset by decreases in prepayment on FHLB advances of $254,000, FDIC insurance premiums of $511,000 and other expenses of $330,000.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax expense of $4.9 million was recognized for fiscal year 2022 compared to an income tax expense of $3.5 million recognized for fiscal year 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended September 30, 2022 was 19.7% compared to 17.5% for the 2021 period.\nAverage Balance Sheets for the Years Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following tables set forth average balance sheets, average yields and costs, and certain other information for the periods indicated.

The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The net column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

The majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. Consequently, our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk. Our assets, consisting primarily of loans, having longer maturities than our liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. As a result, a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. Accordingly, our Board of Directors has approved guidelines for managing the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities, given our business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives. Senior management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset/liability committee meets quarterly to review our asset/liability policies and interest rate risk position. We have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates.\nNet interest income, which is the primary source of the Companys earnings, is impacted by changes in interest rates and the relationship of different interest rates. To manage the impact of the rate changes, the balance sheet should be structured so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities at approximately the same time intervals. The Company uses net interest simulation to assist in interest rate risk management. The process includes simulating various interest rate environments and their impact on net interest income. As of September 30, 2022, the level of net interest income at risk in a 200 basis points increase or a 100 basis point decrease was within the Companys policy limit of a decline less than 10% of net interest income.\nThe following table sets forth the results of the twelve month projected net interest income model as of September 30, 2022.\nNet Interest Income\nChange in Interest Rates in Basis Points (Rate Shock)\nAmount\n$\nChange\n$\nChange\n(%)\n(Dollars in thousands)\n67,143\n(1,449\n)\n(2.1\n)\nStatic\n68,592\n-\n-\n+100\n69,307\n1.0\n+200\n69,810\n1,218\n1.8\n+300\n70,376\n1,784\n2.6\n+400\n70,913\n2,321\n3.4\nThe above table indicates that as of September 30, 2022, in the event of a 400 basis point instantaneous increase in interest rates, the Company would experience an 3.4%, or $2.3 million, increase in net interest income. In the event of a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates, the Company would experience a 2.1%, or $1.4 million, decrease in net interest income.\nAnother measure of interest rate sensitivity is to model changes in the economic value of equity through the use of immediate and sustained interest rate shocks. The following table illustrates the economic value of equity model results as of September 30, 2022.\nEconomic Value of Equity\nChange in Interest Rates in Basis Points\nAmount\n$\nChange\n$\nChange\n(%)\n(Dollars in thousands)\n410,728\n1,264\n0.3\nFlat\n409,464\n-\n-\n+100\n405,252\n(4,212\n)\n(1.0\n)\n+200\n396,169\n(13,295\n)\n(3.2\n)\n+300\n387,926\n(21,538\n)\n(5.3\n)\n+400\n379,261\n(30,203\n)\n(7.4\n)\nThe preceding table indicates that as of September 30, 2022, in the event of an immediate and sustained 400 basis point increase in interest rates, the Company would experience a 7.4%, or $30.2 million, decrease in the present value of equity. If rates were to decrease 100 basis points, the Company would experience a 0.3%, or $1.3 million, increase in the present value of equity.\nCertain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes in net interest income requires the making of certain assumptions regarding prepayment and deposit decay rates, which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. While management believes such assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates and decay rates will approximate actual future loan prepayment and deposit withdrawal activity. Moreover, the net interest income table presented assumes that the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income table provides an indication of the Companys interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet both our short-term and long-term liquidity needs. We adjust our liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay our borrowings and to fund loan commitments. We also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, and earnings and funds provided from operations, as well as access to FHLB advances and other borrowings. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and rates offered by our competition. We set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits.\nA portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, which are a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. At September 30, 2022, $27.9 million of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents. Our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans, proceeds from the maturities of investment securities, principal repayments of mortgage-backed securities and increases in deposit accounts. There were $8.0 million in short-term investment securities (maturing in one year or less) at September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, we had $230.8 million in borrowings outstanding from the FHLB-Pittsburgh. We have access to FHLB advances of up to approximately $756.1 million.\nAt September 30, 2022, we had $431.7 million in loan commitments outstanding, which included $212.7 million in undisbursed construction loans, $53.9 million in unused home equity lines of credit, $114.2 million in commercial lines of credit and $36.4 million in other unused commitments. Certificates of deposit due within one year of September 30, 2022 totaled $85.5 million, or 64.0% of certificates of deposit. If these maturing deposits do not remain with us, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before September 30, 2022. We believe, however, based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will remain with us. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered.\nAs reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, our cash flows are classified for financial reporting purposes as operating, investing or financing cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was $22.7 million and $19.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts differ from our net income because of a variety of cash receipts and disbursements that did not affect net income for the respective periods. Net cash (used) provided by investing activities was $(128.1) million and $31.8 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively, principally reflecting our loan and investment security activities in the respective periods. Cash proceeds from principal repayments, maturities and sales of investment securities amounted to $129.2 million and $111.4 million in the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Deposit and borrowing cash flows have traditionally comprised most of our financing activities which resulted in net cash used for financing activities of $25.6 million in fiscal year 2022, and $48.1 million in fiscal year 2021.\nWe also have obligations under our post retirement plan as described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The post retirement benefit payments represent actuarially determined future payments to eligible plan participants. We froze our pension plan in fiscal year 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in our financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For information about our loan commitments, letters of credit and unused lines of credit, see Note 10 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company also uses derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. For information about the Companys derivatives and hedging activities, see Note 17 of the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor fiscal year 2022, we did not engage in any off-balance-sheet transactions other than loan origination commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of our lending activities. The Company used derivative financial instruments as part of its interest rate hedging activities in 2022.\nImpact of Inflation and Changing Prices\nThe financial statements and related notes of ESSA Bancorp have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). GAAP generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations. Unlike industrial companies, our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature. As a result, changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation.

Item 9A.\nControls and Procedures\n(a)\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principle Executive Officer and Principle Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the fiscal year (the Evaluation Date). Based upon that evaluation, the Principle Executive Officer and Principle Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n(b)\nChanges in internal controls.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n(c)\nManagement report on internal control over financial reporting.\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companys internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Companys management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nOur internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of ESSA Bancorp; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of ESSA Bancorps assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nESSA Bancorp, Inc.s management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth in 2013, by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment we believe that, as of September 30, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.

Actions are taken to correct potential deficiencies as they are identified. Any system of internal control, no matter how well designed, has inherent limitations, including the possibility that a control can be circumvented or overridden and misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, because of changes in conditions, internal control effectiveness may vary over time. Accordingly, even an effective system of internal control will provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation.\nManagement assessed the Companys system of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, in relation to criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting as described in Internal Control - Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management concludes that, as of September 30, 2022, its system of internal control over financial reporting is effective and meets the criteria of the Internal Control - Integrated Framework.\n/s/ Gary S. Olson\nGary S. Olson\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ Allan A. Muto\nAllan A. Muto\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nDecember 14, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of ESSA Bancorp, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and 2021; the related consolidated statement of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the years then ended; and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent, with respect to the Company, in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements; and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter, in any way, our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses (ALL) - Qualitative Factors\nDescription of the Matter\nThe Companys loan portfolio totaled $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2022, and the associated ALL was $18.5 million. As discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, determining the amount of the ALL requires significant judgment about the collectability of loans, which includes an assessment of quantitative factors such as historical loss experience within each risk category of loans and testing of certain commercial loans for impairment. Management applies additional qualitative adjustments to reflect the inherent losses that exist in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date that are not reflected in the historical loss experience. Qualitative adjustments are made based upon changes in economic conditions, portfolio composition trends, classified loan trends, delinquency trends, and external factors.\nWe identified these qualitative adjustments within the ALL as critical audit matters because they involve a high degree of subjectivity. In turn, auditing managements judgments regarding the qualitative factors applied in the ALL calculation involved a high degree of subjectivity.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe gained an understanding of the Companys process for establishing the ALL, including the qualitative adjustments made to the ALL. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys ALL process, which included, among others, managements review and approval controls designed to assess the need and level of qualitative adjustments to the ALL, as well as the reliability of the data utilized to support managements assessment.\nTo test the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the appropriateness of managements methodology and assessed whether all relevant risks were reflected in the ALL and the need to consider qualitative adjustments, including the potential effect of COVID-19 on the adjustments.\nRegarding the measurement of the qualitative adjustments, we evaluated the completeness, accuracy, and relevance of the data and inputs utilized in managements estimate. For example, we compared the inputs and data to the Companys historical loan performance data and third-party macroeconomic data. Furthermore, we analyzed the changes in the components of the qualitative reserves relative to changes in external market factors, the Companys loan portfolio, and asset quality trends, which included the evaluation of managements ability to capture and assess relevant data from both external sources and internal reports on loan customers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the supporting documentation for substantiating revisions to qualitative factors.\nWe also utilized internal credit review specialists to perform procedures on a sample of commercial loans to test the Companys credit risk ratings by comparing key attributes used in the determination of the credit risk rating to supporting documentation such as borrowers financial statements, underlying collateral, financial health of the guarantor, and loan payment history.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2005.\n/s/ S.R.

AND SUBSIDIARY\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA summary of significant accounting and reporting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying financial statements follows:\nNature of Operations and Basis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. (the Company), its wholly owned subsidiary, ESSA Bank & Trust (the Bank), and the Banks wholly owned subsidiaries, ESSACOR Inc.; Pocono Investments Company; ESSA Advisory Services, LLC; Integrated Financial Corporation; and Integrated Abstract Incorporated, a wholly owned subsidiary of Integrated Financial Corporation. The primary purpose of the Company is to act as a holding company for the Bank. On November 6, 2014, the Company converted its status from a savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company. In addition, the Bank converted from a Pennsylvania-chartered savings association to a Pennsylvania-chartered savings bank. The Banks primary business consists of the taking of deposits and granting of loans to customers generally in Monroe, Northampton, Lehigh, Lackawanna, Luzerne, Delaware, Chester, and Montgomery counties, Pennsylvania. The Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The investment in subsidiary on the parent companys financial statements is carried at the parent companys equity in the underlying net assets.\nESSACOR, Inc. is a Pennsylvania corporation that has been used to purchase properties at tax sales that represent collateral for delinquent loans of the Bank and is currently inactive. Pocono Investment Company is a Delaware corporation formed as an investment company subsidiary to hold and manage certain investments, including certain intellectual property. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company owned 100 percent by ESSA Bank & Trust. ESSA Advisory Services, LLC is a full-service insurance benefits consulting company offering group services such as health insurance, life insurance, short-term and long-term disability, dental, vision, and 401(k) retirement planning as well as individual health products. Integrated Financial Corporation is a Pennsylvania Corporation that provided investment advisory services to the general public and is currently inactive. Integrated Abstract Incorporated is a Pennsylvania Corporation that provided title insurance services and is currently inactive. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe accounting principles followed by the Company and its subsidiary and the methods of applying these principles conform to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general practice within the banking industry. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the Consolidated Balance Sheet date and related revenues and expenses for the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSecurities\nThe Company determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.\nSecurities classified as available for sale are those securities that the Company intends to hold for an indefinite period of time but not necessarily to maturity. Any decision to sell a security classified as available for sale would be based on various factors, including significant movement in interest rates, changes in maturity mix of the Companys assets and liabilities, liquidity needs, regulatory capital considerations, and other similar factors.\nSecurities available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of the related deferred tax effects. Realized gains or losses, determined on the basis of the cost of the specific securities sold, are included in earnings. Premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the period to maturity.\nDeclines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses. In estimating other-than-temporary impairment losses, the Company considers: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost; (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; and (3) the Companys intent to sell the security or whether its more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before its anticipated recovery in market value.\nSecurities classified as held-to-maturity are those that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity. These securities are reported at amortized cost.\nThe fair market value of the equity securities tends to fluctuate with the overall equity markets as well as the trends specific to each institution. The equity securities portfolio is reviewed in a similar manner as that of the debt securities with greater emphasis placed on the length of time the market value has been less than the carrying value and the financial sector outlook. The Company also reviews dividend payment activities, levels of non-performing assets and loan loss reserves. The starting point for the equity analysis is the length and severity of market value decline. The realized loss is recognized as impairment charges on securities on the consolidated statements of income. The previous cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new cost basis of the investment.\nCertain equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value are stated at cost, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. These securities include restricted stock of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, as well as other equity securities.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable that the Company has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at their outstanding unpaid principal balances, net of an allowance for loan losses and any deferred fees and costs. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized as an adjustment of the yield (interest income) of the related loans. The Company is generally amortizing these amounts over the contractual life of the loan.\nThe accrual of interest is generally discontinued when the contractual payment of principal or interest has become 90 days past due or the Company has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans generally is either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to the Companys judgment as to the collectability of principal. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current and has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.\nLoans Acquired\nLoans acquired including loans that have evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination and for which it is probable, at acquisition, that the Company will be unable to collect all contractually required payments receivable, are initially recorded at fair value (as determined by the present value of expected future cash flows) with no valuation allowance. Loans are evaluated individually to determine if there is evidence of deterioration of credit quality since origination. The difference between the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition and the investment in the loan, or the accretable yield, is recognized as interest income on a level-yield method over the life of the loan. Contractually required payments for interest and principal that exceed the undiscounted cash flows expected at acquisition, or the non-accretable difference, are not recognized as a yield adjustment or as a loss accrual or a valuation allowance. Increases in expected cash flows subsequent to the initial investment are recognized prospectively through adjustment of the yield on the loan over its remaining estimated life. Decreases in expected cash flows are recognized immediately as impairment. Any valuation allowances on these impaired loans reflect only losses incurred after acquisition.\nFor purchased loans acquired that are not deemed impaired at acquisition, credit discounts representing the principal losses expected over the life of the loan are a component of the initial fair value. Loans are aggregated and accounted for as a pool of loans if the loans being aggregated have common risk characteristics. Subsequent to the purchase date, the methods utilized to estimate the required allowance for credit losses for these loans is similar to originated loans; however, the Company records a provision for loan losses only when the required allowance exceeds any remaining credit discounts. The remaining differences between the purchase price and the unpaid principal balance at the date of acquisition are recorded in interest income over the life of the loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses\nThe allowance for loan losses is established through provisions for loan losses charged against income. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance for loan losses.\nThe allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level by management which represents the evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date. Managements periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the Companys past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective, since it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change, including the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans.\nThe allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For such loans an allowance for loan losses is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers nonclassified loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative factors.\nAll loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and all loan types are considered impaired if the loan is restructured in a troubled debt restructuring. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrowers prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.\nLarge groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment. Accordingly, the Company does not separately identify individual consumer and residential mortgage loans for impairment disclosures unless such loans are part of a larger relationship that is impaired or classified as a troubled debt restructuring or is more than 180 days past due.\nA loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring (TDR) loan when the Company grants a concession to the borrower because of the borrowers financial condition that it would not otherwise consider. Such concessions include the reduction of interest rates, forgiveness of principal or interest, or other modifications of interest rates that are less than the current market rate for new obligations with similar risk. TDR loans that are in compliance with their modified terms and that yield a market rate may be removed from the TDR status after one year of performance.\nRegulatory Stock\nRegulatory stock consists of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Pittsburgh stock and Atlantic Community Bankers Bank stock. Regulatory stock is carried at cost. The Company is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and holds stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. As a member, the Company maintains an investment in the capital stock of the FHLB of Pittsburgh in an amount not less than 10 basis points of the outstanding member asset value plus 4.0 percent of its outstanding FHLB borrowings, as calculated throughout the year. The equity security is accounted for at cost and classified separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The stock is bought from and sold to the FHLB based upon its $100 par value. The stock does not have a readily determinable fair value and as such is classified as restricted stock, carried at cost and evaluated by management. The stocks value is determined by the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than by recognizing temporary declines. The determination of whether the par value will ultimately be recovered is influenced by criteria such as the following: (a) The significance of the decline in net assets of the FHLB as compared to the capital stock amount and the length of time this situation has persisted; (b) commitments by the FHLB to make payments required by law or regulation and the level of such payments in relation to the operating performance; (c) the impact of legislative and regulatory changes on the customer base of the FHLB; and (d) the liquidity position of the FHLB. With consideration given to these factors, management concluded that the stock was not impaired at September 30, 2022.\nLoan Servicing\nServicing assets are recognized as separate assets when rights are acquired through purchase or through sale of financial assets. Capitalized servicing rights are reported in other assets and are amortized into noninterest income in proportion to, and over the\nperiod of, the estimated future net servicing income of the underlying financial assets. Servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon a third-party appraisal. Fair value is determined using prices for similar assets with similar characteristics, when available, or based upon discounted cash flows using market-based assumptions. Impairment is recognized through a valuation allowance to the extent that fair value is less than the capitalized amount. The Companys loan servicing assets at September 30, 2022 and 2021, were not impaired. Total servicing assets included in other assets as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, were $788,000 and $763,000, respectively.\nPremises and Equipment\nLand is carried at cost. Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the useful lives of the related assets, which range from 10 to 40 years for buildings, land improvements, and leasehold improvements and three to seven years for furniture, fixtures, and equipment. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Costs of major additions and improvements are capitalized.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting.\nIn accordance with the FASBs fair value measurement guidance, the Company has elected to measure the credit risk of its derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance (BOLI)\nThe Company owns insurance on the lives of a certain group of key employees. The policies were purchased to help offset the increase in the costs of various fringe benefit plans, including healthcare. The cash surrender value of these policies is included as an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and any increase in cash surrender value is recorded as noninterest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. In the event of the death of an insured individual under these policies, the Company would receive a death benefit which would be recorded as noninterest income.\nForeclosed Real Estate\nReal estate owned acquired in settlement of foreclosed loans is carried at fair value minus estimated costs to sell. At acquisition of real estate acquired in settlement of foreclosed loans, the excess of the remaining loan balance over the assets estimated fair value less cost to sell is charged off against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent declines in the assets value are recognized as noninterest expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Operating expenses of such properties, net of related income, are expensed in the period incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is not amortized, but it is tested at least annually for impairment in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. If the estimated current fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded. The Company uses market capitalization and multiples of tangible book value methods to determine the estimated current fair value of its reporting unit. Based on this analysis, no impairment was recorded in 2022 or 2021.\nThe other intangible assets are assigned useful lives, which are amortized on an accelerated basis over their weighted-average lives. The Company periodically reviews intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable. Based on these reviews, no impairment was recorded in 2022 and 2021.\nThe following tables provide information for the carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets (in thousands):\nGoodwill\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n13,801\n$\n13,801\nGoodwill acquired\n-\n-\nBalance at end of year\n$\n13,801\n$\n13,801\nIntangible assets\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n$\nIntangible assets acquired\n-\n-\nAmortization\n(239\n)\n(271\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n$\nAmortizable intangible assets were composed of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 30,\nGross Carrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\n(dollars in thousands)\nCore deposit intangible\n$\n4,787\n$\n4,506\n$\n4,267\nAggregate amortization expense:\nAs of the years ended September 30\n$\n$\nEstimated future amortization expense (in thousands):\n$\n$\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe Bank maintains a noncontributory, defined benefit pension plan for all employees who have met age and length of service requirements. The Bank also maintains a defined contribution Section 401(k) plan covering eligible employees. The Company created an ESOP for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements. The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis.\nThe Company maintains an equity incentive plan to provide for issuance or granting of shares of common stock for stock options or restricted stock. The Company has recorded stock-based employee compensation cost using the fair value method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. Management estimated the fair values of all option grants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Management estimated the expected life of the options using the simplified method as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles. The risk-free rate was determined utilizing the treasury yield for the expected life of the option contract.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses all advertising expenditures incurred.\nTransfers of Financial Assets\nTransfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when control over the assets has been surrendered. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Company; (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and (3) the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected based on the differences between the financial statement and the income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted marginal tax rates. Deferred income tax expense and benefit are based on the changes in the deferred tax assets or liabilities from period to period. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which such items are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax rates are enacted, deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and individual state income tax returns.\nThe Company prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company has defined cash and cash equivalents as cash and due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with other institutions with original maturities of less than 90 days.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company provides dual presentation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share are calculated utilizing net income as reported as the numerator and average shares outstanding as the denominator. The computation of diluted earnings per share differs in that the dilutive effects of any options are adjusted for in the denominator.\nComprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe Company is required to present comprehensive income (loss) and its components in a full set of general-purpose financial statements for all periods presented. Other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of net unrealized holding gains or losses on its available-for-sale investment and mortgage-backed securities portfolio and derivative instruments, and changes in unrecognized pension cost.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company groups assets and liabilities carried at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are:\nLevel I - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets.\nLevel II - Valuation is based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market.\nLevel III - Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect the Companys own estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset.\nThe Company determines fair value based on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements, in accordance with the fair value hierarchy in generally accepted accounting principles.\nFair value measurements for most of the Companys assets are obtained from independent pricing services that we have engaged for this purpose. When available, the Company, or the Companys independent pricing service, use quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, fair value measurement is based upon models that incorporate available trade, bid, and other market information. Subsequently, all of the Companys financial instruments use either of the foregoing methodologies to determine fair value adjustments recorded to our financial statements. In certain cases, however, when market observable inputs for model-based valuation techniques may not be readily available, we are required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use in estimating the fair value of financial instruments. The degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. For financial instruments that trade actively and have quoted market prices or observable market parameters, there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value. When observable market prices and parameters are not fully available, management judgment is necessary to estimate fair value. In addition, changes in the market conditions may reduce the availability of quoted prices or observable data. When market data is not available, we use valuation techniques requiring more management judgment to estimate the appropriate fair value measurement. Therefore, the results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset. Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows, that could significantly affect the results of current or future valuations.\nReclassification of Comparative Amounts\nCertain items previously reported have been reclassified to conform to the current years reporting format. Such reclassifications did not affect consolidated net income or consolidated stockholders equity.\nAdoption of New Standards\nASC 715 In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715-20). This Update amends to add, remove and clarify disclosure requirements related to defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. The Update eliminates the requirement to disclose the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next year. The Update also removes the disclosure requirements for the effects of a one-percentage-point change on the assumed health care costs and the effect of this change in rates on service cost, interest cost and the benefit obligation for postretirement health care benefits. This Update is effective for public business entities for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2020, and must be applied on a retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2018-14 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, March 2020, to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, such as Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Entities can elect not to apply certain modification accounting requirements to contracts affected by what the guidance calls reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. An entity that makes this election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess a previous accounting determination. Also, entities can elect various optional expedients that would allow them to continue applying hedge accounting for hedging relationships affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met, and can make a one-time election to sell and/or reclassify held-to-maturity debt securities that reference an interest rate affected by reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-08, Codification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables - Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs, which clarifies that, for each reporting period, an entity should reevaluate whether a callable debt security is within the scope of ASC 310-20-35-33. For public business entities, ASU 2020-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early application is not permitted. The adoption of ASU 2020-08 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), which provides optional temporary guidance for entities transitioning away from the London Interbank Offered Rate(LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates (IBORs) to new references rates so that derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions within Topic848. ASU 2021-01 clarifies that the derivatives affected by the discounting transition are explicitly eligible for certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848. ASU 2021-01 is effective immediately for all entities. Entities may elect to apply the amendments on a full retrospective basis as of any date from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. The amendments in this update do not apply to contract modifications made, as well as new hedging relationships entered into, after December 31, 2022, and to existing hedging relationships evaluated for\neffectiveness for periods after December 31, 2022, except for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022, that apply certain optional expedients in which the accounting effects are recorded through the end of the hedging relationship. The adoption of ASU 2021-01 did not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. This Update is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. The underlying premise of the Update is that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect managements current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset. The income statement will be effected for the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. With certain exceptions, transition to the new requirements will be through a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). This Update defers the effective date of ASU 2016-13 for SEC filers that are eligible to be smaller reporting companies, non-SEC filers, and all other companies to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We expect to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to the allowance for loan losses as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the new standard is effective, but cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time adjustment or the overall impact of the new guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), which allows entities to irrevocably elect the fair value option for certain financial assets previously measured at amortized cost upon adoption of the new credit losses standard. To be eligible for the transition election, the existing financial asset must otherwise be both within the scope of the new credit losses standard and eligible for applying the fair value option in ASC 825-10.3. The election must be applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is not available for either available-for-sale or held-to-maturity debt securities. For entities that elect the fair value option, the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the financial asset would be recognized through a cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the date an entity adopted ASU 2016-13. Changes in fair value of that financial asset would subsequently be reported in current earnings. For entities that have not yet adopted the credit losses standard, the ASU is effective when they implement the credit losses standard. For entities that already have adopted the credit losses standard, the ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and does not expect to early adopt ASU 2016-13.\nIn November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, to clarify its new credit impairment guidance in ASC 326, based on implementation issues raised by stakeholders. This Update clarified, among other things, that expected recoveries are to be included in the allowance for credit losses for these financial assets; an accounting policy election can be made to adjust the effective interest rate for existing troubled debt restructurings based on the prepayment assumptions instead of the prepayment assumptions applicable immediately prior to the restructuring event; and extends the practical expedient to exclude accrued interest receivable from all additional relevant disclosures involving amortized cost basis. For entities that have not yet adopted ASU 2016-13 as of November 26, 2019, the effective dates for ASU 2019-11 are the same as the effective dates and transition requirements in ASU 2016-13. For entities that have adopted ASU 2016-13, ASU 2019-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company qualifies as a smaller reporting company and does not expect to early adopt these ASUs.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-03, Codification Improvements to Financial Instruments. This ASU was issued to improve and clarify various financial instruments topics, including the current expected credit losses (CECL) standard issued in 2016. The ASU includes seven issues that describe the areas of improvement and the related amendments to GAAP; they are intended to make the standards easier to understand and apply and to eliminate inconsistencies, and they are narrow in scope and are not expected to significantly change practice for most entities. Among its provisions, the ASU clarifies that all entities, other than public business entities that elected the fair value option, are required to provide certain fair value disclosures under ASC 825, Financial Instruments, in both interim and annual financial statements. It also clarifies that the contractual term of a net investment in a lease under Topic 842 should be the contractual term used to measure expected credit losses under Topic 326. Amendments related to ASU 2019-04 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is not permitted before an entitys adoption of ASU 2016-01. Amendments\nrelated to ASU 2016-13 for entities that have not yet adopted that guidance are effective upon adoption of the amendments in ASU 2016-13. Early adoption is not permitted before an entitys adoption of ASU 2016-13. Amendments related to ASU 2016-13 for entities that have adopted that guidance are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those years. Other amendments are effective upon issuance of this ASU. This Update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method. ASC 815 currently permits only prepayable financial assets and one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable financial instruments to be included in a last-of-layer closed portfolio. The amendments in this Update allow non-prepayable financial assets to also be included in a closed portfolio hedged using the portfolio layer method. That expanded scope permits an entity to apply the same portfolio hedging method to both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets, thereby allowing consistent accounting for similar hedges. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Companys financial position or results of operations.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs) and Vintage Disclosures. The guidance amends ASC 326 to eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing and restructuring activities by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying TDR recognition and measurement guidance, creditors will determine whether a modification results in a new loan or continuation of existing loan. These amendments are intended to enhance existing disclosure requirements and introduce new requirements related to certain modifications of receivables made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Additionally, the amendments to ASC 326 require that an entity disclose current-period gross writeoffs by year of origination within the vintage disclosures, which requires that an entity disclose the amortized cost basis of financing receivables by credit quality indicator and class of financing receivable by year of origination. The guidance is only for entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13 for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption using prospective application, including adoption in an interim period where the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year.

The PPP provides loans to small businesses who were affected by economic conditions as a result of COVID-19 to provide cash-flow assistance to employers who maintain their payroll (including healthcare and certain related expenses), mortgage interest, rent, leases, utilities and interest on existing debt during the COVID-19 emergency. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding principal balances of $702,000 compared to $22.6 million on September 30, 2021. The PPP loans are fully guaranteed by the SBA and may be eligible for forgiveness by the SBA to the extent that the proceeds are used to cover eligible payroll costs, interest costs, rent, and utility costs over a period of up to 24 weeks after the loan is made as long as certain conditions are met regarding employee retention and compensation levels. PPP loans deemed eligible for forgiveness by the SBA will be repaid by the SBA to the Company. PPP loans are included in the Commercial loan category.\nIn accordance with the SBA terms and conditions on the outstanding PPP loans of $702,000 as of September 30, 2022, the Company has approximately $30,000 in unamortized fees associated with the processing of these loans. Upon funding of the\nloan, these fees were deferred and will be amortized over the life of the loan as an adjustment to yield in accordance with FASB ASC 310-20-25-2.\nIncluded in the September 30, 2022 balances are loans acquired from First Star Bank in 2012, Franklin Security Bank in 2014 and Eagle National Bank in 2015.\nThere has been $184,000 in allowance for loan losses recorded for acquired loans with or without specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality as of September 30, 2022. There has been $182,000 in allowance for loan losses recorded for acquired loans with or without specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality as of September 30, 2021. In addition, no allowance for loan losses has been reversed.\nLoans serviced by the Company for others amounted to $200.2 million and $193.9 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company began selling current production residential real estate loans to the FHLB in February 2020.\nThe Companys primary business activity is with customers located in counties where its branch offices are located and to a lesser extent, the contiguous counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Commercial, residential, and consumer loans are granted. The Company also funds commercial and residential loans originated outside its immediate trade area provided such loans meet the Companys credit policy guidelines. Although the Company has a diversified loan portfolio at September 30, 2022 and 2021, loans outstanding to individuals and businesses are dependent upon the local economic conditions in its immediate trade area.\nThe following tables show the amount of loans in each category that was individually and collectively evaluated for impairment at the dates indicated (in thousands):\nTotal\nLoans\nIndividually\nEvaluated\nfor Impairment\nLoans\nAcquired with\nDeteriorated\nCredit Quality\nCollectively\nEvaluated\nfor\nImpairment\nSeptember 30, 2022\nReal estate loans:\nResidential\n$\n623,375\n$\n1,342\n$\n-\n$\n622,033\nConstruction\n25,024\n-\n-\n25,024\nCommercial\n678,841\n12,165\n-\n666,676\nCommercial\n38,158\n-\n37,221\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n40,416\n-\n-\n40,416\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n43,170\n-\n43,134\nAuto Loans\n3,611\n-\n3,595\nOther\n1,716\n-\n1,710\nTotal\n$\n1,454,311\n$\n14,502\n$\n-\n$\n1,439,809\nTotal\nLoans\nIndividually\nEvaluated\nfor Impairment\nLoans\nAcquired with\nDeteriorated\nCredit Quality\nCollectively\nEvaluated\nfor\nImpairment\nSeptember 30, 2021\nReal estate loans:\nResidential\n$\n580,313\n$\n2,646\n$\n-\n$\n577,667\nConstruction\n14,013\n-\n-\n14,013\nCommercial\n591,117\n11,166\n579,074\nCommercial\n63,500\n1,355\n-\n62,145\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n56,164\n-\n-\n56,164\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n38,426\n-\n38,090\nAuto Loans\n13,852\n-\n13,813\nOther\n1,581\n-\n1,573\nTotal\n$\n1,358,966\n$\n15,550\n$\n$\n1,342,539\nThe Company maintains a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral, and financial condition of the borrowers. Specific loan loss allowances are established for identified losses based on a review of such information. A loan evaluated for impairment is considered to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to\nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement. All loans identified as impaired are evaluated independently. The Company does not aggregate such loans for evaluation purposes. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial and construction loans by the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate, the loans obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral-dependent.\nThe following tables include the recorded investment and unpaid principal balances for impaired loans with the associated allowance amount, if applicable, excluding purchased impaired credit loans.

The first six categories are considered not criticized and are aggregated as Pass-rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The Special Mention category includes assets that are fundamentally sound yet, exhibit potentially unacceptable credit risk or deteriorating trends or characteristics which if left uncorrected, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the Companys credit position at some future date. Loans in the Substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected. All loans greater than 90 days past due are considered Substandard. Loans in the Doubtful category have all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans in the Loss category are considered uncollectible and of little value that their continuance as bankable assets is not warranted.\nTo help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Company has a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight. Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the Pass categories unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or death, occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event. The Companys Commercial Loan Officers are responsible for the timely and accurate risk rating of the loans in their portfolios at origination and on an ongoing basis. The Companys credit management team performs an annual review of all commercial relationships $2,000,000 or greater. Confirmation of the appropriate risk grade is included in the review on an ongoing basis. The Company engages an external consultant to conduct\nloan reviews on at least a semiannual basis. Generally, the external consultant reviews commercial relationships greater than $1,000,000 and/or all criticized relationships equal to or greater than $500,000. Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as Substandard on a quarterly basis. Loans in the Special Mention and Substandard categories that are evaluated for impairment are given separate consideration in the determination of the allowance.\nThe following tables present the classes of the loan portfolio summarized by the aggregate Pass and the criticized categories of Special Mention, Substandard, and Doubtful within the internal risk rating system as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nPass\nSpecial\nMention\nSubstandard\nDoubtful\nTotal\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCommercial real estate loans\n$\n659,104\n$\n6,060\n$\n13,677\n$\n-\n$\n678,841\nCommercial\n35,322\n1,690\n1,146\n-\n38,158\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n40,416\n-\n-\n-\n40,416\nTotal\n$\n734,842\n$\n7,750\n$\n14,823\n$\n-\n$\n757,415\nPass\nSpecial\nMention\nSubstandard\nDoubtful\nTotal\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCommercial real estate loans\n$\n549,360\n$\n20,184\n$\n21,573\n$\n-\n$\n591,117\nCommercial\n61,657\n1,702\n-\n63,500\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n56,164\n-\n-\n-\n56,164\nTotal\n$\n667,181\n$\n20,325\n$\n23,275\n$\n-\n$\n710,781\nAll other loans are underwritten and structured using standardized criteria and characteristics, primarily payment performance, and are normally risk rated and monitored collectively on a monthly basis.

Management, in determining the allowance for loan losses, considers the losses inherent in its loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activities, along with the general economic and real estate market conditions. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements: (1) an allocated allowance, which comprises allowances established on specific loans and class allowances based on historical loss experience and current trends, (2) an allocated allowance based on general economic conditions and other risk factors in our markets and portfolios, and (3) an unallocated allowance not to exceed 10% of total reserves which acts as a contingency against unforeseen future events which may negatively impact the Companys loan portfolio. We maintain a loan review system, which allows for a periodic review of our loan portfolio and the early identification of potential impaired loans. Such system takes into consideration, among other things, delinquency status, size of loans, type and market value of collateral, and financial condition of the borrowers. General loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including, but not limited to, actual loan loss experience, composition of the loan portfolio, current economic conditions, managements judgment and losses which are probable and reasonably estimable. The allowance is increased through provisions charged against current earnings and recoveries of previously charged-off loans. Loans that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance. While management uses available information\nto recognize probable and reasonably estimable loan losses, future loss provisions may be necessary, based on changing economic conditions. Payments received on impaired loans generally are either applied against principal or reported as interest income, according to managements judgment as to the collectability of principal. The allowance for loan losses as of September 30, 2022, is maintained at a level that represents managements best estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, and such losses were both probable and reasonably estimable.\nIn addition, the FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking, as an integral part of their examination process, have periodically reviewed the Companys allowance for loan losses. The banking regulators may require that the Company recognize additions to the ALL based on their analysis and review of information available to it at the time of their examination.\nManagement reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis using a defined, consistently applied process in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the ALL. When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged-off against the ALL.\nThe following table summarizes the primary segments of the ALL, segregated into the amount required for loans individually evaluated for impairment and the amount required for loans collectively evaluated for impairment as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nReal\nEstate\nLoans\nObligations of\nStates and\nPolitical\nHome Equity\nLoans and\nLines of\nResidential\nConstruction\nCommercial\nCommercial\nSubdivisions\nCredit\nAuto\nOther\nUnallocated\nTotal\nALL balance at September\n30, 2020\n$\n4,301\n$\n$\n7,209\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,192\n$\n15,400\nCharge-offs\n(83\n)\n-\n(76\n)\n(209\n)\n-\n(9\n)\n(274\n)\n(1\n)\n-\n(652\n)\nRecoveries\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nProvision\n(415\n)\n3,238\n(162\n)\n(19\n)\n(520\n)\n(3\n)\n2,700\nALL balance at September\n30, 2021\n$\n4,114\n$\n$\n10,470\n$\n1,041\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,337\n$\n18,113\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment\n4,097\n10,456\n1,337\n17,685\nALL balance at September\n30, 2021\n$\n4,114\n$\n$\n10,470\n$\n1,041\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,337\n$\n18,113\nALL balance at September\n30, 2021\n$\n4,114\n$\n$\n10,470\n$\n1,041\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n1,337\n$\n18,113\nCharge-offs\n(19\n)\n-\n(23\n)\n-\n-\n(6\n)\n(40\n)\n(22\n)\n-\n(110\n)\nRecoveries\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nProvision\n(343\n)\n(110\n)\n(269\n)\n(390\n)\n-\nALL balance at September\n30, 2022\n$\n5,122\n$\n$\n10,754\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n18,528\nIndividually evaluated for\nimpairment\n$\n$\n-\n$\n$\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\nCollectively evaluated for\nimpairment\n5,110\n10,453\n18,177\nALL balance at September\n30, 2022\n$\n5,122\n$\n$\n10,754\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n18,528\nThe allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, and actual losses will vary from current estimates. Management believes that the granularity of the homogeneous pools and the related historical loss ratios and other qualitative factors, as well as the consistency in the application of assumptions, result in an ALL that is representative of the risk found in the components of the portfolio at any given date. During the year ended September 30, 2022 the Company recorded provision expense for the residential real estate loans, construction real estate loans, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other loans segments due to either increased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments. Credit provisions were recorded for loan loss for the commercial loans, obligations of states and political subdivisions, and auto loans segments due to either decreased loan balances, improved asset quality, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or decreased charge-off activity in those segments. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the allowance for loan loss for residential real estate loans increased $1.0 million due primarily to an increase in residential real estate loans of $43.1 million. During the year ended September 30, 2021 the Company recorded provision for loan losses for the construction loan, commercial real estate and commercial loan segments, due to either increased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments. Credit provisions were recorded for the residential real estate, obligations of states and political subdivisions, home equity loans and lines of credit, other segments and auto loan segments due to either decreased loan balances, changes in the loan mix within the pool, and/or charge-off activity in those segments.\nThe following is a summary of troubled debt restructurings granted during the periods indicated (dollars in thousands).\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2022\nNumber of\nContracts\nPre-Modification\nOutstanding\nRecorded\nInvestment\nPost-Modification\nOutstanding\nRecorded\nInvestment\nTroubled debt restructurings\nReal estate loans:\nResidential\n$\n$\nConstruction\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial\n-\n-\n-\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n-\n-\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n-\n-\n-\nAuto loans\n-\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n$\nFor the Year Ended September 30, 2021\nNumber of\nContracts\nPre-Modification\nOutstanding\nRecorded\nInvestment\nPost-Modification\nOutstanding\nRecorded\nInvestment\nTroubled debt restructurings\nReal estate loans:\nResidential\n$\n$\nConstruction\n-\n-\n-\nCommercial\n8,392\n8,392\nCommercial\n-\n-\n-\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n-\n-\nHome equity loans and lines of credit\n-\n-\n-\nAuto loans\n-\n-\n-\nOther\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n$\n9,163\n$\n9,163\nOne new troubled debt restructuring granted for the year ended September 30, 2022 totaled $44,000 and was granted interest rate and terms concessions. One new troubled debt restructuring granted for the year ended September 30, 2022 totaled $39,000 and was granted interest rate and interest capitalization concessions.\nOf the eight new troubled debt restructurings granted for the year ended September 30, 2021, six loans totaling $2.4 million were granted terms concessions and two loans totaling $6.8 million were granted terms and rate concessions.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 there was no loan modifications classified as troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted within one year of modification\nAs of September 30, 2022, the Company has initiated formal foreclosure proceedings on $748,000 of consumer residential mortgages which have not yet been transferred into foreclosed assets.\nCOVID-19 Loan Forbearance Programs\nSection 4013 of the CARES Act provides that banks may elect not to categorize a loan modification as a TDR if the loan modification is (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date on which the national emergency concerning the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak declared by the President on March 13, 2020, under the National Emergencies Act terminates, or (B) December 31, 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, the president signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which amended CARES Act Section 4013. The amendment extends the applicable period for which a financial institution is able to (a) suspend the\nrequirements under United States generally accepted accounting principles for loan modifications related to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic that would otherwise be categorized as a troubled debt restructuring and (b) any determination of a loan modified as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic as being a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes. The amended end date for the relief related to a financial institution electing to suspend TDR and loan impairment accounting for qualifying modifications was extended from the earlier of December 31, 2020, or 60 days after the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the president terminates to the earlier of January 1, 2022, or 60 days after the national emergency concerning COVID-19 declared by the president terminates.\nOn April 7, 2020, federal banking regulators issued a revised interagency statement that included guidance on their approach for the accounting of loan modifications in light of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The guidance interprets current accounting standards and indicates that a lender can conclude that a borrower is not experiencing financial difficulty if short-term modifications are made in response to COVID-19, such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant related to the loans in which the borrower is less than 30 days past due on its contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented.\nAccording to the Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working with Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised) issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies on April 7, 2020, short-term loan modifications not otherwise eligible under Section 4013 that are made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 to borrowers who were current prior to any relief are not TDRs. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant.\nAt September 30, 2022, one of our customers had remained on loan payment deferrals or payments of interest only on loans totaling $4.5 million. In accordance with Section 4013 of the CARES Act and the interagency guidance issued on April 7, 2020, this deferral is not considered a troubled debt restructuring.\n5.\nPREMISES AND EQUIPMENT\nPremises and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):\nLand and land improvements\n$\n6,075\n$\n6,075\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n16,030\n16,404\nFurniture, fixtures, and equipment\n13,961\n13,495\nConstruction in process\n-\n36,073\n35,974\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(22,947\n)\n(22,369\n)\nTotal\n$\n13,126\n$\n13,605\nDepreciation expense amounted to $896,000 and $886,000 for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 respectively.\n6.\nDEPOSITS\nDeposits and their respective weighted-average interest rates consist of the following major classifications (dollars in thousands):\nWeighted-\nAverage\nInterest Rate\nAmount\nWeighted-\nAverage\nInterest Rate\nAmount\nNoninterest-bearing demand accounts\n-\n%\n$\n290,061\n-\n%\n$\n257,747\nInterest bearing demand accounts\n0.10\n357,516\n0.05\n551,168\nMoney market accounts\n0.73\n402,080\n0.14\n428,272\nSavings and club accounts\n0.05\n196,696\n0.05\n189,004\nCertificates of deposit\n0.49\n133,668\n0.73\n209,924\nTotal\n0.29\n%\n$\n1,380,021\n0.15\n%\n$\n1,636,115\nAt September 30, 2022 scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit are as follows (in thousands):\n$\n85,512\n26,775\n12,383\n4,507\n4,491\nTotal\n$\n133,668\nThe Company had no brokered deposits at September 30, 2022.

The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit with a minimum denomination of $250,000 were $14.6 million and $44.9 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe scheduled maturities of certificates of deposit in denominations of $250,000 or more as of September 30, 2022, are as follows (in thousands):\nWithin three months\n$\n3,343\nThree through six months\n1,340\nSix through twelve months\n5,371\nOver twelve months\n4,548\nTotal\n$\n14,602\n7.\nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had $230.8 million and $0 of short-term borrowings, respectively. There were $4.8 million in advances in 2022 and no advances in 2021 on a $150.0 million line of credit with the FHLB.\nAll borrowings from the FHLB are secured by a blanket lien on qualified collateral, defined principally as investment securities and mortgage loans that are owned by the Company free and clear of any liens or encumbrances. At September 30, 2022, the Company had a borrowing limit of approximately $756.1 million, with a variable rate of interest, based on the FHLBs cost of funds.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning short-term borrowings (in thousands):\nBalance at year-end\n$\n230,810\n$\n-\nMaximum amount outstanding at any month-end\n230,810\n61,713\nAverage balance outstanding during the year\n63,754\n12,661\nWeighted-average interest rate:\nAs of year-end\n3.37\n%\n-\nPaid during the year\n0.62\n%\n0.43\n%\nAverage balances outstanding during the year represent daily average balances, and average interest rates represent interest expenses divided by the related average balance.\n8.\nOTHER BORROWINGS\nThere were no FHLB long term advances as of September 30, 2022 and 2021.

Benefits from tax positions should be recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.\nThere is currently no liability for uncertain tax positions and no known unrecognized tax benefits. The Company recognizes, when applicable, interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The Companys federal and state income tax returns for taxable years through 2018 have been closed for purposes of examination by the Internal Revenue Service and the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue.\nThe reconciliation of the federal statutory rate and the Companys effective income tax rate is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome\nAmount\n% of\nPretax\nIncome\nProvision at statutory rate\n$\n5,251\n21.0\n%\n$\n4,178\n21.0\n%\nIncome from bank-owned life insurance\n(159\n)\n(0.6\n)\n(179\n)\n(0.9\n)\nTax-exempt income\n(292\n)\n(1.2\n)\n(404\n)\n(2.0\n)\nLow-income housing credits\n(45\n)\n(0.2\n)\n(187\n)\n(0.9\n)\nOther, net\n0.7\n0.3\nActual tax expense and effective rate\n$\n4,934\n19.7\n%\n$\n3,473\n17.5\n%\nThe Bank is subject to the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Institutions Tax that is calculated at 11.5 percent of earnings based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles with certain adjustments.\n10.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES\nIn the normal course of business, management makes various commitments that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Companys exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other parties to the financial instruments is represented by the contractual amounts as disclosed. Losses, if any, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. The Company minimizes its exposure to credit loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and review procedures and collateral requirements, as deemed necessary, in compliance with lending policy guidelines.\nThe off-balance sheet commitments consist of the following (in thousands):\nCommitments to extend credit\n$\n292,563\n$\n254,413\nStandby letters of credit\n14,490\n17,887\nUnfunded lines of credit\n124,656\n119,111\nThe commitments outstanding at September 30, 2022, contractually mature in less than one year.\nThe instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments. The amount of collateral obtained, as deemed necessary, is based upon managements credit evaluation in compliance with the lending policy guidelines. Since many of the credit line commitments are expected to expire without being fully drawn upon, the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future funding requirements.\nStandby letters of credit and financial guarantees represent conditional commitments issued to guarantee performance of a customer to a third party. The coverage period for these instruments is typically a one-year period with renewal option subject to prior approval by management. Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized over the coverage period. For secured letters of credit, the collateral is typically Company deposit instruments.\nThe Company is required to maintain a reserve balance with certain third party providers. At September 30, 2022 the reserve balance was $1.2 million.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of Management, the resolution of these legal actions is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations.\nThe Bank was named as a defendant in an action commenced on December 8, 2016 by one plaintiff who sought to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiff alleges that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks in the process of making loans, in violation of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. In an order dated January 29, 2018, the district court granted the Banks motion to dismiss the case. The plaintiff appealed the courts ruling. In an opinion and order dated April 26, 2019, the appellate court reversed the district courts order dismissing the plaintiffs case against the Bank and remanded the case back to the district court in order to continue the litigation. The litigation is now proceeding before the district court. On December 9, 2019, the court permitted an\namendment to the complaint to add two new plaintiffs to the case asserting similar claims. On May 21, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs motion for class certification. In an order dated November 24, 2020, the court referred the case to a Magistrate Judge to assist in mediation efforts. The case was stayed while the parties explored the potential for a negotiated resolution. The parties engaged in mediation but did not resolve the matter. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable.\nOn May 29, 2020, the Bank was named as a defendant in a second action commenced by three plaintiffs who also seek to pursue this action as a class action on behalf of the entire class of people similarly situated. The plaintiffs allege that a bank previously acquired by ESSA Bancorp received unearned fees and kickbacks from a different title company than the one involved in the previously discussed litigation in the process of making loans. The original complaint alleged violations of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Sherman Act, and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on September 30, 2020 that dropped the RICO claim, but they are continuing to pursue the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Sherman Act claims. The Bank moved to dismiss the Sherman Act claim on October 14, 2020, and that motion was denied on April 2, 2021. The parties are now in the discovery process. The Bank will continue to defend against plaintiffs allegations. To the extent that this matter could result in exposure to the Bank, the amount of such exposure is not currently estimable.\n11. LEASES\nA lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company accounts for all its leases in accordance with Topic 842. For the Company, Topic 842 primarily affects the accounting treatment for operating lease agreements in which the Company is the lessee.\nLessee Accounting\nSubstantially all of the leases in which the Company is the lessee are comprised of real estate property for branches, ATM locations, and office space with terms extending through 2044. All of our leases are classified as operating leases on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet for both periods.\nThe following table presents the Consolidated Balance Sheet classification of the Companys right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company elected not to include short-term leases (i.e., leases with initial terms of twelve months or less), or equipment leases (deemed immaterial) on the Consolidated Balance sheet.\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLease Right-of-Use Assets\nClassification\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nOther assets\n$\n6,075\nTotal Lease Right-Of-Use Assets\n$\n6,075\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLease Liabilities\nClassification\nOperating lease liabilities\nOther liabilities\n$\n6,275\nTotal Lease Liabilities\n$\n6,275\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLease Right-of-Use Assets\nClassification\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nOther assets\n$\n6,222\nTotal Lease Right-Of-Use Assets\n$\n6,222\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLease Liabilities\nClassification\nOperating lease liabilities\nOther liabilities\n$\n6,370\nTotal Lease Liabilities\n$\n6,370\nThe calculated amount of the ROU assets and lease liabilities in the table above are impacted by the length of the lease term and the discount rate used to present value the minimum lease payments. The Companys lease agreements often include one or more options to renew at the Companys discretion. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal\noption to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. Regarding the discount rate, Topic 842 requires the use of the rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases\n12.2\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases\n2.38\n%\nSeptember 30, 2021\nWeighted average remaining lease term\nOperating leases\n13.3 years\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases\n2.44\n%\nThe following table represents lease costs and other lease information. As the Company elected, for all classes of underlying assets, not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for them as a single lease component, the variable lease cost primarily represents variable payments such as common area maintenance and utilities.\nLease Costs (in thousands)\nTwelve Months Ended September 30, 2022\nOperating lease cost\n$\n1,025\nVariable lease cost\nNet lease cost\n$\n1,355\nLease Costs (in thousands)\nTwelve Months Ended September 30, 2021\nOperating lease cost\n$\n1,056\nVariable lease cost\nNet lease cost\n$\n1,350\nFuture minimum payments for leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as of September 30, 2022 were as follows:\n(in thousands)\nLeases\nTwelve months Ended:\nSeptember 30, 2023\n$\nSeptember 30, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2025\nSeptember 30, 2026\nSeptember 30, 2027\nThereafter\n4,056\nTotal future minimum lease payments\n7,351\nAmounts representing interest\n(1,076\n)\nPresent Value of Net Future Minimum Lease Payments\n$\n6,275\n12.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)\nThe Company created an ESOP for the benefit of employees who meet the eligibility requirements, which include having completed one year of service with the Company or its subsidiary and attained age 21. The ESOP trust acquired 1,358,472 shares of the Companys stock in 2007 from proceeds from a loan with the Company. The Company makes cash contributions to the ESOP on an annual basis sufficient to enable the ESOP to make the required loan payments. Cash dividends paid on allocated shares are distributed to participants and cash dividends paid on unallocated shares are used to repay the outstanding debt of the ESOP. The ESOP trusts outstanding loan bears interest at prime, adjustable each January 1st, which was 3.25% at September 30, 2022 and requires an annual payment of principal and interest through December of 2036. The Companys ESOP, which is internally leveraged, does not report the loans receivable extended to the ESOP as assets and does not report the ESOP debt due to the Company.\nAs the debt is repaid, shares are released from the collateral and allocated to qualified employees based on the proportion of payments made during the year to the remaining amount of payments due on the loan through maturity. Accordingly, the shares\npledged as collateral are reported as unallocated common stock held by the ESOP shares in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As shares are released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the current market price of the shares, and the shares become outstanding for earnings-per-share computations. The Company recognized ESOP expense of $792,000 and $642,000, for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table presents the components of the ESOP shares:\nAllocated shares\n390,547\n398,180\nShares committed to be released\n33,962\n33,962\nUnreleased shares\n645,274\n690,556\nTotal ESOP shares\n1,069,783\n1,122,698\nFair value of unreleased shares (in thousands)\n$\n13,170\n$\n11,387\nEquity Incentive Plan\nThe Company previously maintained the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan). The Plan provided for a total of 2,377,326 shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards. Of the shares available under the Plan, 1,698,090 were available to be issued in connection with the exercise of stock options and 679,236 were available to be issued as restricted stock. The Plan allowed for the granting of non-qualified stock options (NSOs), incentive stock options (ISOs), and restricted stock. Options under the plan were granted at no less than the fair value of the Companys common stock on the date of the grant. As of the effective date of the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (detailed below), no further grants will be made under the plan and forfeitures of outstanding awards under the plan will be added to the shares available under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan.\nThe Company replaced the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan with the ESSA Bancorp, Inc. 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan). The 2016 Plan provides for a total of 250,000 shares of common stock for issuance upon the grant or exercise of awards. The 2016 Plan allows for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive stock options and non-qualified stock options.\nThe Company classifies share-based compensation for employees and outside directors within Compensation and employee benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Income to correspond with the same line item as compensation paid.\nRestricted stock shares outstanding at September 30, 2022 vest over periods ranging from 1 year to 3 years. The product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Companys common stock determines the fair value of restricted shares under the Companys restricted stock plan. The Company expenses the fair value of all share based compensation grants over the requisite service period.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded $517,000 and $515,000 of share-based compensation expense consisting of restricted stock expense. Expected future compensation expense relating to the restricted shares outstanding, at September 30, 2022 is $519,000 over the remaining vesting period of 3.0 years.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Companys nonvested restricted stock as of September 30, 2022, and changes therein during the year then ended:\nNumber of\nRestricted Stock\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nNonvested at September 30, 2021\n42,116\n$\n13.99\nGranted\n34,080\n16.48\nVested\n(33,011\n)\n15.39\nForfeited\n(7,546\n)\n14.91\nNonvested at September 30, 2022\n35,639\n$\n14.88\nDefined Benefit Plan\nThe Bank sponsors a trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and officers. The plan calls for benefits to be paid to eligible employees at retirement based primarily upon years of service with the Bank and compensation rates near retirement. The Banks funding policy is to make annual contributions, if needed, based upon the funding formula developed by the plans actuary. In February 2017, the Bank amended the defined benefit pension plan to provide that no additional participants would enter the plan and no additional benefits would accrue beyond February 28, 2017.\nThe following table sets forth the change in plan assets and benefit obligation at September 30 (in thousands):\nChange in benefit projected obligation:\nProjected benefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n20,895\n$\n20,315\nService cost\n-\n-\nInterest cost\nActuarial (gains) losses\n(5,129\n)\nBenefits paid\n(3,546\n)\n(469\n)\nProjected benefit obligation at end of year\n12,776\n20,895\nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n23,248\n20,253\nActual return on plan assets\n(3,152\n)\n3,464\nContributions\n-\n-\nBenefits paid\n(3,545\n)\n(469\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n16,551\n23,248\nFunded status\n$\n3,775\n$\n2,353\nAmounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost at September 30 (in thousands):\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome consist of:\nNet loss\n$\n1,401\n$\n2,413\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plan was $12.8 million and $20.9 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe following table comprises the components of net periodic benefit cost for the years ended September 30 (in thousands):\nService cost\n$\n-\n$\n-\nInterest cost\nExpected return on plan assets\n(1,228\n)\n(1,155\n)\nRecognized net actuarial loss\nSettlement loss\n-\nNet periodic benefit\n$\n(410\n)\n$\n(484\n)\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the years ended September 30:\nDiscount rate\n5.31\n%\n2.61\n%\nRate of compensation increase\nN/A\nN/A\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended September 30:\nDiscount rate 1\n2.61\n%\n2.33\n%\nExpected long-term return on plan assets\n6.00\n%\n6.00\n%\nRate of compensation increase\nN/A\nN/A\nThe expected long-term rate of return was estimated using market benchmarks by which the plan assets would outperform the market in the future, based on historical experience adjusted for changes in asset allocation and expectations for overall lower future returns on similar investments compared with past periods.\n1 Discount rates were 2.61% for October 1 - December 31, 2021; 2.66% for January 1 - March 31, 2022; 3.54% for April 1 - June 30, 2022; and 4.50% for July 1 - September 30, 2022\nPlan Assets\nThe following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy, the plans financial assets at fair value as of September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nInvestment in collective trusts:\nFixed income\n$\n-\n$\n6,670\n$\n-\n$\n6,670\nEquity\n-\n9,831\n-\n9,831\nInvestment in short-term investments\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n-\n$\n16,551\n$\n-\n$\n16,551\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nInvestment in collective trusts:\nFixed income\n$\n-\n$\n9,432\n$\n-\n$\n9,432\nEquity\n-\n13,777\n-\n13,777\nInvestment in short-term investments\n-\n-\nTotal assets at fair value\n$\n-\n$\n23,248\n$\n-\n$\n23,248\nInvestments in collective trusts and short-term investments are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the plan.\nThe Banks defined benefit pension plan weighted-average asset allocations at September 30, 2022 and 2021 by asset category, are as follows:\nSeptember 30,\nAsset Category\nFixed income securities\n40.3\n%\n40.6\n%\nEquity securities\n59.4\n59.2\nOther\n0.3\n0.2\nTotal\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nThe Bank believes that the plans risk and liquidity position are, in large part, a function of the asset class mix. The Bank desires to utilize a portfolio mix that results in a balanced investment strategy. Three asset classes are outlined, as above. The target allocations of these classes are as follows: equity securities, 65 percent, and cash and fixed income securities, 35 percent.\nCash Flows\nThe Bank does not expect to make any contributions to its pension plan in fiscal 2023.\nEstimated future benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are as follows (in thousands):\n$\n1,368\n1,419\n2028-2032\n3,663\n401(k) Plan\nThe Bank also has a savings plan qualified under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which covers substantially all employees over 21 years of age. Employees can contribute to the plan, but are not required to. Employer contributions were reinstated in March 2017. Employer contributions are allocated based on employee contribution levels. The expense related to the plan for the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $496,000 and $489,000, respectively.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nThe Bank maintains a salary continuation agreement with certain executives of the Bank, which provides for benefits upon retirement to be paid to the executive for no less than 192 months, unless the executive elects to receive the present value of the payments as a lump sum. The Bank has recorded accruals of $2.6 million and $2.3 million at September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively which represent the estimated present value (using a discount rate of 6.00 percent) of the benefits earned under this agreement. There was $63,000 and $66,000 in expense related to the supplemental executive retirement plan for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n13.\nREGULATORY RESTRICTIONS\nReserve Requirements\nThe Bank is required to maintain reserve funds in cash or in deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank. In response to the pandemic, the Federal Reserve Bank reduced the reserve requirement to zero effective March 26, 2020. As a result, there was no required reserve at September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nDividend Restrictions\nFederal banking laws, regulations, and policies limit the Banks ability to pay dividends to the Company. Dividends may be declared and paid by the Bank only out of net earnings for the then current year. A dividend may not be declared or paid if it would impair the general reserves of the Bank as required to be maintained under the Pennsylvania Banking.\n14.\nREGULATORY CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS\nFederal regulations require the Bank and the Company to maintain certain minimum amounts of capital. Specifically, the Bank is required to maintain certain minimum dollar amounts and ratios of Total and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, of Tier 1 capital to average total assets, and common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets.\nBank holding companies are generally subject to statutory capital requirements, which were implemented by certain of the new capital regulations described above that became effective on January 1, 2015. However, the Small Banking Holding Company Policy Statement exempts certain small bank holding companies like the Company from those requirements provided that they meet certain conditions.\nIn addition to the capital requirements, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) established five capital categories ranging from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized. Should any institution fail to meet the requirements to be considered adequately capitalized, it would become subject to a series of increasingly restrictive regulatory actions. Management believes that, as of September 30, 2022, the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject.\nAs of September 30, 2022, and 2021, the FDIC categorized the Bank and the Federal Reserve categorized the Company as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be classified as a well-capitalized financial institution, Total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, common equity Tier 1 capital and Tier 1 leverage capital must be at least 10 percent, 8 percent, 6.5 percent, and 5 percent, respectively. There have been no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Banks or the Companys category.\nThe Banks actual capital ratios for the years ended September 30 are presented in the following table (dollars in thousands):\nAmount\nRatio\nAmount\nRatio\nTotal capital\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual\n$\n211,390\n13.3\n%\n$\n199,019\n14.5\n%\nFor capital adequacy purposes\n126,843\n8.0\n110,039\n8.0\nTo be well capitalized\n158,554\n10.0\n137,549\n10.0\nTier 1 capital\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual\n$\n192,810\n12.2\n%\n$\n181,814\n13.2\n%\nFor capital adequacy purposes\n95,132\n6.0\n82,529\n6.0\nTo be well capitalized\n126,843\n8.0\n110,039\n8.0\nCommon equity tier 1 capital\n(to risk-weighted assets)\nActual\n$\n192,810\n12.2\n%\n$\n181,814\n13.2\n%\nFor capital adequacy purposes\n71,349\n4.5\n61,897\n4.5\nTo be well capitalized\n103,060\n6.5\n89,407\n6.5\nTier 1 capital\n(to adjusted assets)\nActual\n$\n192,810\n10.5\n%\n$\n181,814\n10.0\n%\nFor capital adequacy purposes\n73,656\n4.0\n72,390\n4.0\nTo be well capitalized\n92,070\n5.0\n90,488\n5.0\n15.\nFAIR VALUE\nThe following disclosures show the hierarchal disclosure framework associated within the level of pricing observations utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The definition of fair value maintains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value but focuses on the exit price of the asset or liability. The exit price is the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability adjusted for certain inherent risks and restrictions. Expanded disclosures are also required about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities.\nAssets and Liabilities Required to be Measured and Reported at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables provide the fair value for assets required to be measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 by level within the fair value hierarchy (in thousands).\nReoccurring Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nAssets:\nInvestment securities available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities\n$\n-\n$\n110,160\n$\n-\n$\n110,160\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n9,920\n-\n9,920\nU.S. government agency securities\n-\n9,330\n-\n9,330\nCorporate obligations\n-\n63,745\n7,374\n71,119\nOther debt securities\n-\n8,118\n-\n8,118\nTotal debt securities\n-\n201,273\n7,374\n208,647\nEquity securities - financial services\n-\n-\nDerivatives and hedging activities\n-\n24,481\n-\n24,481\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives and hedging activities\n-\n9,176\n-\n9,176\nReoccurring Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nAssets:\nInvestment securities available for sale:\nMortgage-backed securities\n$\n-\n$\n55,068\n$\n-\n$\n55,068\nObligations of states and political subdivisions\n-\n13,246\n-\n13,246\nU.S. government treasury securities\n-\n99,997\n-\n99,997\nU.S. government agency securities\n-\n2,002\n-\n2,002\nCorporate obligations\n-\n47,505\n11,112\n58,617\nOther debt securities\n-\n11,651\n-\n11,651\nTotal debt securities\n-\n229,469\n11,112\n240,581\nEquity securities - financial services\n-\n-\nDerivatives and hedging activities\n-\n2,554\n-\n2,554\nLiabilities:\nDerivatives and hedging activities\n-\n1,756\n-\n1,756\nThe following tables present a summary of changes in the fair value of the Companys Level III investments for years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands).\nFair Value Measurement Using\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level III)\nSeptember 30,\nSeptember 30,\nBeginning balance\n$\n11,112\n$\n8,260\nPurchases, sales, issuances, settlements, net\n1,515\n2,608\nTotal unrealized gain:\nIncluded in earnings\n-\n-\nIncluded in other comprehensive income\n(753\n)\nTransfers into Level III\n-\n-\nTransfers out of Level III\n(4,500\n)\n-\n$\n7,374\n$\n11,112\nEach financial asset and liability is identified as having been valued according to a specified level of input, 1, 2 or 3. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy, within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls, has been determined based on the lowest level\ninput that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset.\nThe measurement of fair value should be consistent with one of the following valuation techniques: market approach, income approach, and/or cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities (including a business). For example, valuation techniques consistent with the market approach often use market multiples derived from a set of comparable. Multiples might lie in ranges with a different multiple for each comparable. The selection of where within the range the appropriate multiple falls requires judgment, considering factors specific to the measurement (qualitative and quantitative). Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach include matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but rather by relying on a securitys relationship to other benchmark quoted securities. Most of the securities classified as available for sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. For these securities, the Company obtains fair value measurements from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quoted market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the bonds terms and conditions, among other things. Securities reported at fair value utilizing Level 1 inputs are limited to actively traded equity securities whose market price is readily available from the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ exchange. A few securities are valued using Level 3 inputs, all of these are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value using Level 3 inputs.\nAssets and Liabilities Required to be Measured and Reported on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe following tables provide the fair value for assets required to be measured and reported at fair value on a non recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 by level within the fair value hierarchy:\nSeptember 30, 2022\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nFair Value\nFinancial assets:\nForeclosed real estate\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nImpaired loans\n-\n-\n14,151\n14,151\nSeptember 30, 2021\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nFair Value\nFinancial assets:\nForeclosed real estate\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n$\nImpaired loans\n-\n-\n15,122\n15,122\nThe following tables present additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis and for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair value:\nQuantitative Information About Level III Fair Value Measurements\nFair Value\nEstimate\nValuation\nTechniques\nUnobservable\nInput\nRange\n(Weighted Average)\nSeptember 30, 2022\nImpaired loans\n$\n14,151\nAppraisal of\ncollateral (1)\nAppraisal\nadjustments (2)\n0% to 35%\n(20.6%)\nForeclosed real estate owned\nAppraisal of\ncollateral (1)\nAppraisal\nadjustments (2)\n20%\n(20.0%)\nSeptember 30, 2021\nImpaired loans\n$\n15,122\nAppraisal of\ncollateral (1)\nAppraisal\nadjustments (2)\n0% to 50%\n(24.1%)\nForeclosed real estate owned\nAppraisal of\ncollateral (1)\nAppraisal\nadjustments (2)\n20% to 35%\n(20.1%)\n(1)\nFair value is generally determined through independent appraisals of the underlying collateral, which generally include various level 3 inputs which are not identifiable.\n(2)\nAppraisals may be adjusted by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses. The range of liquidation expenses and other appraisal adjustments are presented as a percent of the appraisal.\nInvestment Securities Available for Sale\nThe fair value of securities available for sale are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1), or matrix pricing (Level 2), which is a mathematical technique used widely in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities relationship to other benchmark quoted prices. For certain securities which are not traded in active markets or are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations are adjusted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, and such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence (Level 3). In the absence of such evidence, managements best estimate is used. Managements best estimate consists of both internal and external support on certain Level 3 investments. Internal cash flow models using a present value formula that includes assumptions market participants would use along with indicative exit pricing obtained from broker/dealers (where available) are used to support fair values of certain Level 3 investments, if applicable.\nEquity Securities\nThe fair value of equity securities are determined by obtaining quoted market prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges (Level 1).\nImpaired Loans\nThe Company has measured impairment on impaired loans generally based on the fair value of the loans collateral. Evaluating impaired loan collateral is based on Level II inputs utilizing outside appraisals. Those impaired loans for which management incorporates significant adjustments for sales costs and other discount assumptions regarding market conditions are considered Level III fair values. The fair value consists of the loan balances of $14.5 million less their valuation allowances of $351,000 at September 30, 2022. The fair value consists of the loan balances of $15.6 million less their valuation allowances of $428,000 at September 30, 2021.\nForeclosed Real Estate Owned\nForeclosed real estate owned is measured at fair value, less cost to sell at the date of foreclosure; valuations are periodically performed by management; and the assets are carried at fair value, less cost to sell. Income and expenses from operations and changes in valuation allowance are included in the net expenses from foreclosed real estate.\nDerivatives\nThe Companys objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. The fair value of the swap asset and liability is based on an external derivative model using data inputs as of the valuation date and are classified Level 2.\nAssets and Liabilities not Required to be Measured and Reported at Fair Value\nThe methods and assumptions used by the Company in estimating fair values of financial instruments at September 30, 2022 and 2021 is in accordance with ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments which requires public entities to use exit pricing in the calculations of the tables below. Prior period fair value calculations were run on the assumption of entry pricing and therefore the comparability between the periods below are diminished.\nSeptember 30, 2022\nCarrying\nValue\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nFair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLoans receivable, net\n$\n1,435,783\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,351,823\n$\n1,351,823\nMortgage servicing rights\n-\n-\n1,390\n1,390\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n57,285\n-\n47,546\n-\n47,546\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits\n1,380,021\n1,246,353\n-\n128,533\n1,374,886\nShort-term borrowings\n230,810\n-\n-\n215,287\n215,287\nSeptember 30, 2021\nCarrying\nValue\nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nFair Value\nFinancial assets:\nLoans receivable, net\n$\n1,340,853\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n1,353,420\n$\n1,353,420\nMortgage servicing rights\n-\n-\nInvestment securities held to maturity\n21,483\n-\n21,249\n-\n21,249\nFinancial liabilities:\nDeposits\n1,636,115\n1,426,191\n-\n209,660\n1,635,851\nFor Cash and Cash Equivalents, Accrued Interest Receivable, Regulatory Stock, Bank Owned Life Insurance, Short-Term Borrowings, Advances by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable the carrying value is a reasonable estimate of the fair value and are considered Level 1 measurements.\nThe fair value approximates the current book value.\n16.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe activity in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in thousands):\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (1)\nDefined\nBenefit\nPension\nPlan\nUnrealized\nGains (Losses)\non Securities\nAvailable for Sale\nDerivatives\nTotal\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n$\n(1,907\n)\n$\n1,962\n$\n$\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications\n(15,841\n)\n12,116\n(3,134\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss\n-\n(650\n)\n(442\n)\nPeriod change\n(15,841\n)\n11,466\n(3,576\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2022\n$\n(1,108\n)\n$\n(13,879\n)\n$\n12,093\n$\n(2,894\n)\nBalance at September 30, 2020\n$\n(3,432\n)\n$\n3,167\n$\n(3,791\n)\n$\n(4,056\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before\nreclassifications\n1,350\n(842\n)\n2,837\n3,345\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss\n(363\n)\n1,581\n1,393\nPeriod change\n1,525\n(1,205\n)\n4,418\n4,738\nBalance at September 30, 2021\n$\n(1,907\n)\n$\n1,962\n$\n$\n(1)\nAll amounts are net of tax.

The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate, liquidity, and credit risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its assets and liabilities and the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. The Companys derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences in the amount, timing, and duration of the Companys known or expected cash receipts and its known or expected cash payments.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nThe table below presents the fair value of the Companys derivative financial instruments as well as their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, (in thousands).\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nAsset Derivatives\nAs of September 30, 2022\nAs of September 30, 2021\nHedged Item\nNotional Amount\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nNotional Amount\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nBrokered Deposits\n$\n-\nDerivative and hedging assets\n$\n-\n$\n175,000\nDerivative and hedging assets\n$\n1,247\nFHLB Advances\n225,000\nDerivative and hedging assets\n15,310\n-\nDerivative and hedging assets\n-\nCommercial Loans\n79,602\nDerivative and hedging assets\n9,171\n71,326\nDerivative and hedging assets\n1,307\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments\n$\n304,602\n$\n24,481\n$\n246,326\n$\n2,554\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nLiability Derivatives\nAs of September 30, 2022\nAs of September 30, 2021\nHedged Item\nNotional Amount\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nBalance Sheet Location\nFair Value\nBrokered Deposits\n$\n-\nDerivative and hedging liabilities\n$\n-\n$\n60,000\nDerivative and hedging liabilities\n$\nCommercial Loans\n111,668\nDerivative and hedging liabilities\n9,176\n103,831\nDerivative and hedging liabilities\n1,304\nTotal derivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments\n$\n111,668\n$\n9,176\n$\n163,831\n$\n1,756\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nThe Companys objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest income and expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company has entered into interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed payments. As of September 30, 2022, the Company had ten interest rate swaps with a notional of $225 million associated with the Companys cash outflows associated with various FHLB advances and $191 million associated with commercial loans. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had eleven interest rate swaps with a notional of $235 million associated with the Companys cash outflows associated with various brokered deposits and $175 million associated with commercial loans.\nFor derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is initially reported in other comprehensive income (outside of earnings), net of tax, and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and the ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized directly in earnings. The Company assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship by comparing the changes in cash flows of the derivative hedging instrument with the changes in cash flows of the designated hedged transactions. The Company did not recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in earnings during the periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAmounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest income/expense as interest payments are made/received on the Companys variable-rate assets/liabilities. During the 12 months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $823,000 in gains and $2.0 million in losses classified to interest expense, respectively. During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that $8.2 million will be reclassified as a decrease in interest expense.\nThe table below presents the effect of the Companys cash flow hedge accounting on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income for the periods ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 (in thousands).\nThe Effect of Fair Value and Cash Flow Hedge Accounting on Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nDerivatives in Hedging Relationships\nAmount of Gain Recognized in OCI\non Derivative\nAmount of Gain (Loss) Reclassified from\nAccumulated OCI into Income\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nLocation of Gain\nReclassified from\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30,\nAccumulated OCI\ninto Income\nDerivatives in Cash Flow Hedging Relationships\nInterest Rate Products\n$\n14,507\n$\n5,592\nInterest Expense\n$\n$\n(2,001\n)\nTotal\n$\n14,507\n$\n5,592\n$\n$\n(2,001\n)\nCredit-risk-related Contingent Features\nThe Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company defaults on any of its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, then the Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations.\nThe Company also has agreements with certain of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well / adequately capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements.\nAs of September 30, 2022 the Company had derivatives in a net asset position and was not required to post collateral against its obligations under these agreements. As of September 30, 2021 the Company had derivatives in a net liability position and was required to post $640,000 in collateral against its obligations under these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions at September 30, 2022 and 2021, it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at the termination value.\n18.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company accounts for its applicable revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of Topic 606 is that an entity recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. Topic 606 requires entities to exercise judgment when considering the terms of a contract. Topic 606 applies to all contracts with customers to provide goods or services in the ordinary course of business, except for contracts that are specifically excluded from its scope.\nTopic 606 does not apply to revenue associated with interest income on financial instruments, including loans and securities. Additionally, certain noninterest income streams, such as income from bank-owned life insurance, gains on loans sold, and gains and losses on sales of debt and equity securities, are out of scope of Topic 606. The Company has evaluated the nature of its contracts with customers and determined that further disaggregation beyond what is presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income was not necessary.\nThe main types of non interest income within the scope of the standard are:\nTrust and Investment Fees\nTrust and asset management income is primarily comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets. The Companys performance obligation is generally satisfied over time and the resulting fees are recognized monthly, based upon the month-end market value of the assets under management and the applicable fee rate. Payment is generally received a few days after month end through a direct charge to customers accounts. The Company does not earn performance-based incentives. Optional services such as real estate sales and tax return preparation services are also available to existing trust and asset management customers. The Companys performance obligation for these transactional-based services is generally satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time (i.e. as incurred). Payment is received shortly after services are rendered.\nService Charges on Deposit Accounts\nService charges on deposit accounts consist of account analysis fees (i.e. net fees earned on analyzed business and public checking accounts), monthly service fees, check orders, and other deposit account related fees. The Companys performance obligation for account analysis fees and monthly service fees is generally satisfied, and the related revenue recognized, over the\nperiod in which the service is provided. Check orders and other deposit account related fees are largely transactional based, and therefore, the Companys performance obligation is satisfied, and related revenue recognized, at a point in time. Payment for service charges on deposit accounts is primarily received immediately or in the following month through a direct charge to customers accounts.\nFees, Exchange, and Other Service Charges\nFees, interchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit card income, ATM fees, cash management income, and other services charges. Debit card income is primarily comprised of interchange fees earned whenever the Companys debit cards are processed through card payment networks such as Mastercard. ATM fees are primarily generated when a Company cardholder uses a non-Company ATM or a non-Company cardholder uses a company ATM. Other service charges include revenue from processing wire transfers, bill pay service, cashiers checks, and other services. The Companys performance obligation for fees, exchange, and other service charges are largely satisfied, and related revenue recognized when the services are rendered or upon completion. Payment is typically received immediately or in the following month.\nInsurance Commissions\nInsurance income primarily consists of commissions received on product sales. The Company acts as an intermediary between the Companys customer and the insurance carrier. The Companys performance obligation is generally satisfied upon the issuance of the policy. Shortly after the policy is issued, the carrier remits the commission payment to the Company, and the Company recognizes the revenue.\n19.\nPARENT COMPANY\nCondensed financial statements of ESSA Bancorp, Inc. are as follows (in thousands):\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEET\nSeptember 30,\nASSETS\nCash and due from banks\n$\n6,355\n$\n3,203\nEquity securities\nInvestment in subsidiary\n203,998\n196,817\nPremises and equipment, net\nOther assets\n1,702\n1,530\nTOTAL ASSETS\n$\n212,482\n$\n201,983\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nOther liabilities\n$\n$\nStockholders equity\n212,337\n201,822\nTOTAL LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\n$\n212,482\n$\n201,983\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF INCOME\nYear Ended September 30,\nINCOME\nInterest income\n$\n$\nUnrealized gain on equity securities\n(4\n)\n(15\n)\nDividends\n10,000\n12,501\nTotal income\n10,330\n12,818\nEXPENSES\nProfessional fees\nOther\nTotal expenses\nIncome before income tax benefit\n9,763\n12,342\nIncome tax benefit\n(52\n)\n(22\n)\nIncome before equity in undistributed net earnings of subsidiary\n9,815\n12,364\nEquity in undistributed net earnings of subsidiary\n10,255\n4,060\nNET INCOME\n$\n20,070\n$\n16,424\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n$\n16,494\n$\n21,162\nCONDENSED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nYear Ended September 30,\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet income\n$\n20,070\n$\n16,424\nAdjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by\noperating activities:\nEquity in undistributed net earnings of subsidiary\n(10,255\n)\n(4,060\n)\nProvision for depreciation\nIncrease in accrued income taxes\nDecrease (increase) in accrued interest receivable\nOther, net\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n10,309\n12,931\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nPurchase of treasury stock shares\n(1,884\n)\n(7,078\n)\nDividends on common stock\n(5,273\n)\n(4,694\n)\nNet cash used for financing activities\n(7,157\n)\n(11,772\n)\nDecrease in cash\n3,152\n1,159\nCASH AT BEGINNING OF YEAR\n3,203\n2,044\nCASH AT END OF YEAR\n$\n6,355\n$\n3,203\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nESSA BANCORP, INC.\nDecember 14, 2022\nBy:\n/s/ Gary S.
