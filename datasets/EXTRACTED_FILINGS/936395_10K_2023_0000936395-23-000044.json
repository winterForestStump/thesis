    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nWe are a network platform, software, and services company, providing solutions that enable a wide range of network operators to deploy and manage next-generation networks that deliver services to businesses and consumers. We provide hardware, software and services that support the delivery of video, data and voice traffic over core, metro, aggregation and access communications networks. Our solutions are used globally by communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, cloud providers, submarine network operators, governments, and enterprises across multiple industry verticals.\nOur portfolio is designed to enable the Adaptive Network\u2122, which is our vision for a network end state that leverages a programmable and scalable network infrastructure, driven by software control and automation capabilities, that is informed by network analytics and intelligence. By transforming network infrastructures into dynamic, programmable environments driven by automation and analytics, network operators can realize greater business agility, adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands, and rapidly introduce new revenue-generating services. They can also gain valuable, real-time network insights, allowing them to optimize network performance and maximize the return on their network infrastructure investment.\nOur solutions include Networking Platforms, including our Optical Networking portfolio and our Routing and Switching portfolio, which can be applied from the network core to end-user access points, and which allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic efficiently and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. Our Optical Networking portfolio, which we previously referred to as our Converged Packet Optical portfolio, includes products that support long haul and regional networks, submarine and data center interconnect networks, and metro and edge networks. Our Routing and Switching portfolio includes products and solutions that enable efficient internet protocol (IP) transport in next-generation metro core, aggregation, and access networks, including in enterprise edge and broadband access applications.\nTo complement our Networking Platforms, we offer Platform Software, which includes our Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) applications that deliver advanced multi-layer domain control and operations. Through our Blue Planet\u00ae Software, we also enable complete service lifecycle management automation with productized operational support systems (OSS), which include inventory, orchestration and assurance solutions that help our customers to achieve closed loop automation across multi-vendor and multi-domain environments.\nIn addition to our systems and software, we also offer a broad range of services that help our customers build, operate and improve their networks and associated operational environments. These include network transformation, consulting, implementation, systems integration, maintenance, network operations center (NOC) management, learning, and optimization services.\nIndustry Background\nNetwork Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements\nThe markets into which we sell are dynamic and characterized by a high rate of change. Optical networks - which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables - have experienced strong demand for increased bandwidth due to traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by enterprise and consumer end users, as well as cloud-based services and applications:\nCloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models - including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content, and utilize on-demand computing resources. In addition, content is increasingly moving to the network edge, creating new capacity and traffic demands closer to the user.\nOver-the-Top (OTT) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.\nMobile Traffic and Fifth-Generation Wireless Broadband (5G). Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the continued proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place higher demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites. 5G technology is further enabling meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance, and enabling emerging applications and services that 4G/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures.\nResidential Access Applications and Enterprise Applications. In recent years there has been a shift in bandwidth demands, traffic patterns and computing functions to the edge of networks. This trend was meaningfully accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including due to an increase in remote and hybrid working, distance learning, and work from home arrangements. With a higher percentage of data flows concentrating closer to the network edge, more capacity and higher bandwidth to home and enterprise locations is required. These shifts could be permanent, and could influence network architectures and require network operators to adapt.\nFiber-Based Access Networks. Network densification initiatives by cable and multiservice operators seek to push more digital fiber closer to the end user in an effort to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while decreasing power, space and operating costs. Wireline service providers are responding to similar service and end customer demands by extending fiber to the home and deeper into access networks.\nEmerging technologies, services and applications are further impacting, or expected to impact network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. These include:\nInternet of Things (IoT). As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic (M2M) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications.\nImmersive Technologies and Ultra-High Definition Video (UHD). Immersive technologies like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), interactive experiences, gaming and 360\u00b0 video, as well as UHD (4K and 8K) video, are placing or likely to place further capacity demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics and other technology companies are rapidly advancing these applications, which require high bandwidth and low latency, and are making the associated devices more widely available and affordable to consumers.\nEdge Computing. To provide end users with the required experience for a growing set of immersive cloud services, network operators have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, the number and capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users. These changes at the edge of networks may affect network topologies, demands and traffic patterns.\nMachine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). By increasing network intelligence and improving automation, ML and AI can enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. Adoption of these technologies is expected to continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, and ML and AI are expected to serve as drivers of further network traffic and solutions innovation, including driving bandwidth needs in industries including manufacturing, research and development, robotics, security, healthcare, and transportation.\nGenerative AI (Gen-AI). In recent periods, Gen-AI platforms have experienced rapid and unprecedented user adoption with a notable array of new offerings entering the market across a diverse set of use cases. While Gen-AI remains a nascent space and may be subject to further regulation, it presents significant opportunities for businesses and other users to automate tasks, augment creativity, and improve operational efficiency. Given the Gen-AI adoption trajectory to date, and its potential to be a significant contributor to innovation and productivity, Gen-AI may be a significant stimulant or accelerator of network demand, both inside and outside of the data center, in future periods.\nWe believe that increased adoption of these technologies, services, and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures, requiring network operators to invest in their metro, access and aggregation networks, as well as their core networks.\nDemand for More Programmable and Automated Networks\nTo create a more digital experience for their end users, reduce operational costs and introduce more service agility, network operators are investing in next-generation infrastructures that combine end-to-end service automation with the deployment of highly programmable infrastructures. We expect network operators will continue to pursue strategies that better leverage analytics and control capabilities in an effort to achieve closed loop automation. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the programmable network infrastructure and software control elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability to determine the best placement of traffic or network functions to deliver optimal service quality and resource utilization.\nWe believe that adoption of these strategies, and the related evolution of core, metro, aggregation and access network infrastructures, will require network operators and their network solutions vendors increasingly to look to utilize an ecosystem of both physical and virtual network resources, optimized through software. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will require an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among networking solutions vendors.\nDifferent Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions\nNetwork operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or consumption models, in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to purchasing fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor, new consumption models include the procurement or use of:\na fully integrated infrastructure solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operators own software or that of another vendor;\nintegrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or disaggregated procurement of modem technology from a different vendor;\nopen source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions;\nopen IP network operating systems running on off-the-shelf third-party equipment; and\nsystem integration services or customer self-integration to reconstitute the disaggregated components.\nSome network operators, including certain of our largest customers, have adopted or are pursuing development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as white box hardware). This commoditized hardware could be used with in-house developed data path and control software or third-party developed network operating software. Further, some network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, that can be housed in a switch or router platform or used in place of a modem in a traditional optical system.\nThe consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. While the adoption of these approaches has been limited to date, we expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing a premium on a vendors ability to provide a range of network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.\nSupply Chain Dynamics\nIn the face of demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits, and other electronic components, experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent prior periods. Though supply conditions have begun to stabilize, in response to this period of constrained supply, governments worldwide have intensified efforts to enhance supply chain resilience, emphasizing the need for robust risk management strategies.\nIn addition, current dynamics between the United States and China are playing a pivotal role in shaping the global supply chain landscape, and have had an important impact on trade policies, resiliency efforts, and various domestic preference and investment initiatives. This changing bilateral relationship, which is marked by trade tensions and geopolitical complexities, has prompted both nations to reassess their economic strategies, creating a dynamic environment for many industries. This situation, characterized by tariffs and technological competition, may introduce reconfiguration of global supply chains and prompt companies to diversify sourcing and manufacturing locations. Simultaneously, there is a growing emphasis on domestic preference initiatives, as countries seek to bolster their own manufacturing capabilities in an effort to ensure greater economic autonomy. This evolving landscape presents challenges and opportunities for companies navigating the wide range of resulting regulatory, economic and supply chain management complexities.\nProduct Development and Sustainability\nAs network traffic and service expansion continue to grow, network operators are looking toward technology innovation to help support their business models and prepare for a low carbon future. Network operators are increasingly looking to their technology vendor partners to help them manage the environmental impact of their networks, including energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, and equipment refurbishment and recycling. Market transition to a low carbon future and greener technology present meaningful opportunities for enhanced competitive positioning and business growth for technology innovation leaders capable of advancing a product development strategy that addresses network performance and sustainability outcomes.\nStrategy\nOur strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversification and global scale to drive the profitable growth of our business.

Our current development efforts are focused on:\nReinforcing our coherent optical leadership with continued development that advances reach, transmission speed, spectral efficiency, power-per-bit, and service automation and assurance;\nExecuting on parallel innovation paths for our next generation modem technology, including introducing our WaveLogic6 Extreme and WaveLogic6 Nano offerings;\nDelivering on our Adaptive IP approach and extending the IP/routing capabilities and use cases of our Routing and Switching solutions to include converged metro core routing and support for mobile network 5G routing and cross-haul, enterprise edge, and fiber-based access networks for enterprise and residential access service delivery;\nExtending capacity of our fiber-based broadband access technologies and solutions;\nPursuing development to address different consumption models, including our module, pluggable, and component development initiatives;\nEnhancing our Adaptive Network vision through advances in hardware programmability and software-based domain control, automation and analytics through MCP and purpose-built applications;\nAdvancing our software-led transformation strategy and product development for our Blue Planet Automation Software to enable generation OSS transformation and closed loop automation;\nDeveloping products that enhance security and reduce risk to our customers networks from cyber attacks; and\nDelivering products that minimize the lifecycle climate impacts of our customers networks and support their sustainability goals.\nOur research and development efforts are also geared toward portfolio optimization and engineering changes intended to drive product and manufacturing cost reductions across our platforms, and enable muti-vendor sourcing of components.\nWe regularly review our existing solutions offerings and prospective development of new features, components or products in order to determine their fit within our portfolio and broader corporate strategy. We also assess the market demand, technology evolution, prospective return on investment and growth opportunities, as well as the costs and resources necessary to develop and support these products. To ensure that our product development investments and solutions offerings are closely aligned with market demand, we continually seek input from customers and promote collaboration among our product development, marketing and sales organizations. In some cases, where we seek to utilize or gain access to complementary or\nemerging technologies or solutions, we may obtain technology through an acquisition or, alternatively, through initiatives with third parties pursuant to technology licenses, OEM arrangements and other strategic technology relationships or investments. In addition, we participate in industry and standards organizations and, where appropriate, incorporate information from these affiliations throughout the product development process.\nGlobal Customer Engagement\nOur Global Customer Engagement organization includes a direct and indirect sales, system engineering, and services presence that is organized geographically around the following geographies and customer types: (i) the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (Americas); (ii) International, which includes Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific, Japan and India (APAC); and (iii) global cloud and content networking customers, which include cloud provider, content, and data center companies. Within each focus area, we maintain specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as partner resources, field marketing, services professionals and commercial management personnel, who ensure that we maintain a high-touch, consultative relationship with our customers.\nWe also maintain a global partner program that includes distributors, resellers, systems integrators, service providers, original equipment manufacturers, original design manufacturers, and other third-party distributors who market and sell our products and services. We utilize these third-party channel partners to market and sell our solutions into specific geographies, applications or customer verticals. We believe there are opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand our addressable market, while at the same time reducing the financial and operational risk of entering additional markets. For third parties in our Ciena Partner Network, we maintain a code of conduct that is available on our website and that sets forth our expectations for the high standards of ethical and legally compliant conduct we require of them in supporting our business.\nTo support our global customer engagement efforts, we invest in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners.\nOperations and Supply Chain Management\nMost of the manufacturing for our products is conducted through third-party contract manufacturers. Our operations personnel manage the relationships with these third-party manufacturers and the global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.\nWe utilize a sourcing strategy that traditionally emphasized global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower labor cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand, India, and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk, changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries, and physical risk, including the impact of climate change. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers and component distribution partners procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers and component distribution partners activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with these partners and our suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our suppliers and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not commit to long-term volume purchases.\nWe currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.\nWe continue to focus on a range of initiatives that seek to optimize our operations, improve our resiliency, and drive cost reductions and efficiencies. Our efforts include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.\nTo enhance operational efficiency and modernize our supply chain operations, while driving long-term sustainability and resilience in the face of dynamic market conditions, we are pursuing a number of digital technology transformation efforts, including advanced analytics, automation, and other digital solutions. We regularly assess and monitor our supply chain risks, and have implemented various strategies to mitigate these risks and enhance resilience. These measures include dual-sourcing strategies, inventory management initiatives, and ongoing collaboration with key suppliers to ensure transparency and alignment with our goals.\nWe actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards that aim to ensure working conditions in the electronics industry, or industries in which electronics are a key component, and its supply chains are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to agree to adhere to these same standards. We also publish a Sustainability Report and maintain a Human Rights Policy applicable to suppliers, each of which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices.\nSeasonality\nWe have historically experienced seasonal quarterly fluctuations in customer activity in both orders and revenue, particularly with service provider customers. We have experienced reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of these customers slow and network deployment activity is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has typically caused revenue for the first quarter of our fiscal year to be below that of the preceding quarter. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations. The effects of the dynamic supply and demand environment we have experienced in recent periods, together with our increased backlog, have impacted and may continue to impact the traditional seasonality in our business. In addition, the growth as a percentage of our revenue of cloud provider customers, who do not necessarily follow the same seasonal ordering pattern, may also change this pattern in the future. For a more detailed discussion of the current supply and demand environment and our backlog, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Overview in Item 7 of Part II of this report.\nCompetition\nCompetition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The market in which we compete is characterized by rapidly advancing technology, frequent introduction of new solutions, and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Nokia, Huawei (as defined below), Cisco, Juniper Networks, and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, Ribbon Communications, Calix, Adtran, DZS, and Ekinops. We also compete with a number of companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment or geographic market.\nKeeping pace with the markets demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon component and module technology developed by and procured from third-party providers, including NTT Electronics, Marvell Technology Group and Cisco. We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors or an alternative consumption model such as white box technology, or directly in module, pluggable and component sales opportunities.\nAs we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and traditional IT services vendors. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, Netcracker and Ericsson.\nAcross our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include, among others:\nfunctionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;\nthe ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;\nprice for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions;\nincumbency and strength of existing business relationships;\ntechnology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development;\ntime-to-market in delivering products and features;\ncompany stability and financial health;\nability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;\nflexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management;\nability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;\noperating costs and total cost of ownership;\nsoftware and network automation capabilities;\nability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability;\nservices and support capabilities;\nsecurity of enterprise, product development, support processes, and products;\nspace requirements and power consumption of network solutions; and\nability to offer solutions that help customers manage the lifecycle impacts of their networks and achieve their climate sustainability goals.\nOur competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by international trade and related matters, in particular between the U.S. and China. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. (Huawei) and certain affiliates to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S., resulting in significant new restrictions on the export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei, and amended the foreign direct product rule under the EAR in a manner that significantly expanded its application to Huawei. Separately, the U.S. has taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions have resulted in escalating tensions between the U.S. and China and retaliation by China, and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take further steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies.\nWe also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box hardware, particularly where a customers network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.\nPatents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights\nThe success of our business and technology leadership depends significantly on our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries in which we do business. As of December 1, 2023, we had approximately 2,100 issued patents and more than 650 pending patent applications worldwide.\nEnforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent, or minimize the risks of all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts\nand market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.\nEnvironment and Sustainability\nIn 2023, we set new environmental goals that have been approved by the Science Based Target initiative and align our decarbonization efforts with the Paris Climate Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Our environmental strategy involves continued innovation of our products and services to help reduce power, space, and materials, driving operational efficiencies to reduce our business impact on the environment, engagement and collaboration with our suppliers and other business partners, and promoting an employee experience that engages our workforce on sustainability.\nOur products and product development efforts pursue improvements in our solutions space and power requirements, creating more efficient and sustainable networks for our customers and enabling their climate ambitions. We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design, and to manage the life cycle impact of our products, including packaging and distribution, support, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We voluntarily provide on an annual basis CDP climate change and water disclosures and are a member of the RBA. We seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct.\nPeople and Culture\nOur technology solutions are developed, marketed, sold and supported by the talented individuals that make up our global workforce of 8,483 employees as of October 28, 2023, over 98% of whom were full-time employees. We have a broad base of talent in more than 38 countries, with approximately 57% in the Americas, 35% in APAC, and 8% in EMEA, the majority of whom are in engineering, operations or sales roles.\nWe believe that our industry and innovation leadership is ultimately rooted in people. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology space is intense, and our success depends in large part on our ability to recruit, develop and retain a productive and engaged workforce. Accordingly, investing in our employees and their well-being, offering competitive compensation and benefits, and adopting progressive human capital management practices constitute a core element of our corporate strategy.\nOur Board of Directors oversees our corporate strategy, which includes managements design and execution of our people strategy. This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to attract and retain the talent necessary to execute on our business plans, and that we have programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are well aligned and support these goals. Through our People Promise, we promote a workplace environment where our employees are empowered, feel included, and have an opportunity to make a difference through their work at Ciena. In doing so, we seek to cultivate for employees a culture of vibrancy, belonging and happiness, enabling us to be an attractive employer of choice within our markets. Our executive team is actively involved in and sponsors key initiatives and employee resource groups intended to promote this corporate culture. To that end, our people strategy is focused on the following:\nPromote a Diverse, Inclusive, and Equitable Culture. We promote an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability, sexual orientation or gender identity through recruiting outreach, internal networking and resource groups, inclusivity networks, and mentoring programs. We also maintain a global Inclusivity Council, which is led by two of our executives and aims to address actions for inclusion, and we have signed The CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion. As of October 28, 2023, our global workforce was approximately 21.6% female. Our Board of Directors is 30% female and 20% ethnically diverse. As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S., where we are headquartered, our 1,890 employee workforce approximately reflected the following ethnicities: 64.2% White, 21.9% Asian, 6.2% Hispanic or Latino, 5.0% Black or African American, 2.2% two or more races (Not Hispanic or Latino), and 0.5% additional groups (including American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). We regularly monitor our recruitment process to improve the diversity of our workforce and candidate pool and continue to offer Conscious Inclusion workshops to deepen understanding within our diverse groups. In addition, we support multiple active internal networking and resource groups, including our Women at Ciena group, Black & African Heritage at Ciena group, LatinX at Ciena group, Asian at Ciena group, Pride at Ciena group, Vets at Ciena group, and Next at Ciena early in career group. In fiscal 2023, we continued to run a targeted development program aimed at strengthening\nunderrepresented individuals sense of belonging and enhancing communication, confidence, self-awareness and financial acumen.\nSupport Employee Wellbeing and Engagement. We prioritize supporting the overall wellbeing of our employees and their eligible dependents. We provide a broad and diverse suite of programs that focus on physical, mental and emotional, financial and social wellbeing, and have expanded our offerings to include a focus on key life events such as aging and retirement readiness. Our wellbeing programs are deployed through a variety of means, including expense reimbursement benefits, wellbeing challenges and rewards, 24x7 crisis support, employee assistance resources, mental health coaching, and a library of resources accessible to participants digitally and through hosted webinars. We regularly seek input from employees through employee engagement and pulse surveys on specific issues that are intended to assess our degree of success in promoting an environment that supports our People Promise and measures our culture of compliance. Our fiscal 2023 employee engagement survey had a participation rate of approximately 84% and resulted in an engagement score that exceeded industry benchmarks. Our global wellbeing program also includes a long-standing practice of remote and flexible working arrangements and flexible paid time off in many of our geographies.\nOffer Competitive Compensation and Ensure Pay Equity. We strive to ensure that our employees receive competitive, fair and transparent compensation, and progressive benefits offerings. We conduct an annual pay equity assessment of gender globally and of ethnicity in the U.S., and take action to ensure that we are paying individuals performing similar work equitably. We deployed Syndios workplace equity platform beginning in fiscal 2020 to fine-tune our methodology and enable regular global pay equity assessments. To align performance and stockholder interest, we base our annual incentive compensation on both business and individual performance, we maintain an employee stock purchase plan, and we have broadly expanded employee participation in equity compensation in recent years. We also offer comprehensive family leave, including global family leave to support employees throughout various life stages, carers leave, bereavement leave, parental leave that includes a minimum of 18 weeks paid time off for new mothers (including eight weeks recovery and ten weeks bonding) and ten weeks paid time off for new fathers and adoptive parents, and financial assistance for adoptive parents, and recently expanded flexible paid time-off to more than 98% of our workforce globally. We offer meaningful retirement benefits and programs to promote retirement readiness among our employees. In recent years, we have enhanced employer contributions to our North America retirement plans, added our first ESG fund option for employees and, as of October 28, 2023, achieved greater than 99% participation of eligible employees in the U.S. and Canada in our defined contribution retirement plans.\nProvide Programs for Employee Recognition. We also offer rewards and recognition programs to our employees, including peer and management-initiated awards to recognize employees who achieve noteworthy accomplishments and who best exemplify our core values, as well as patent incentive and distinguished engineer awards. We believe that providing these recognition programs helps drive strong employee performance.\nCreate Opportunities for Growth and Development. As of October 28, 2023, approximately 20.9% of our employees are early in career, or age 30 and under, 51% are mid-career, or age 31 to 50, and 28.1% are late in career, or age 51 and over. We focus on creating opportunities for employee growth, development, training, and education at all career stages. We provide opportunities to cultivate talent and identify candidates for new roles from within the company, and deliver early in career and new graduate networking and development programs, management and leadership development programs, coaching and mentoring programs, and support for continuing education through tuition reimbursement. We operate a leadership succession planning process that aims to develop and retain key talent and ensure business continuity for key roles. We also recently launched a program to identify individuals throughout the organization who have been identified as having high potential for future growth and development, so that this earlier in career talent can be nurtured for future leadership roles.\nPromote Community Outreach and Support. We believe it is important to give back and promote community outreach and support through corporate giving, charitable matching, and employee volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work. Through our Ciena Cares community program, we provide corporate matching of employee charitable donations, flexible volunteering during work time, and corporate rewards for service hours that can be donated by employees to their charity of choice. Our Digital Inclusion initiative aims to mobilize our global workforce, leverage our innovation leadership, and collaborate with customers, suppliers and other partners to help bridge the digital divide. Through this initiative, we have funded programs to support underserved students in communities across the globe by providing greater connectivity, access to enabling technologies and digital skills development.\nPromote a Strong Ethical Business Culture. We believe that commitments to good corporate governance and the highest ethical standards are essential to our long-term success, and we are dedicated to instilling in our employees a\ncommitment to integrity and business ethics. We maintain a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that sets standards of conduct for Cienas directors, officers and employees. All employees are required to complete training on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and we conduct recurring employee affirmations with respect to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and periodic training and communication related to specific topics contained therein. In addition, we maintain a Corporate Compliance Committee that promotes integrity and compliance leadership throughout Ciena, and a dedicated function focused exclusively on Compliance and Ethics. We also maintain several easily accessible internal and external methods by which our employees, business partners, and investors can report concerns relating to the ethical operation of our business, including anonymously where permitted. We conduct surveys of all employees on our compliance program and culture of integrity in order to assess and strengthen our culture and practices, and received feedback from approximately 69% of our employees on these surveys in fiscal 2022.\nGovernmental Regulations\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental regulation is increasing across various jurisdictions, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Our business and operations are currently subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union (the EU). We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of conflict minerals in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with applicable laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling, and have programs, policies, and customer offerings that help us to address these laws.\nOther Regulations\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including trade regulations, tariffs, import and export regulations, anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws and regulations, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR), cybersecurity laws and regulations, and environmental regulations, among others. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to these laws, rules and regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Government regulations are subject to change and, accordingly, we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business in the future. For further discussion of how government regulations may affect our business, see the related discussion in Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy.\nAccess to SEC Reports\nOur website address is www.ciena.com. We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, available free of charge in the Investors section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). We routinely post these reports, recent news and announcements, financial results and other important information about our business on our website at www.ciena.com. Information contained on our website is not a part of this annual report.\nInformation About Our Executive Officers and Directors\nThe table below sets forth certain information concerning our executive officers and directors:\nName Age Position\nPatrick H.

Risk Factors\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this report, you should consider the following risk factors before investing in our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur backlog may not be an accurate indicator of the level and timing of our future revenues.\nAs a result of order volumes growth in prior periods, driven by supply chain constraints and longer delivery lead times, our backlog grew from $1.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2020 to $4.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. As supply chain conditions improved, we have been able to increase shipment volumes and reduce lead times, and our backlog decreased to $2.6 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. However, our order volumes began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and we continued to experience orders that are below revenue during fiscal 2023. We do not expect the very high level of orders we experienced in earlier periods in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022 to return or continue in the long-term. While we expect order volumes to normalize over time, we expect our backlog to continue to reduce in fiscal 2024. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, either due to customer schedules or delays caused by supply chain constraints. Generally, our customers may cancel, delay delivery or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance have been rare historically. Backlog also includes certain service obligations that may relate to a multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.\nOur revenue, gross margin, and operating results can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably from quarter to quarter.\nOur revenue, gross margin, and results of operations can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably from quarter to quarter. Our budgeted expense levels are based on our visibility into customer spending plans and our projections of future revenue and gross margin. Visibility into customer spending levels can be uncertain, spending patterns are subject to change, and reductions in our expense levels can take significant time to implement. Historically, a significant portion of our quarterly revenue was generated from customer orders received during that same quarter (which we refer to as book to revenue) and was therefore less predictable and subject to fluctuation due to a quarterly shortfall in orders from expectations. During fiscal 2022, however, we generated a significant backlog of customer orders, and through the first half of fiscal 2023, our revenue was more significantly impacted by availability of supply, as well as customer delivery deferrals of existing backlog. Specifically, during fiscal 2023, certain customers, including communications service providers and cable and multiservice operators in North America, and cloud providers, that had earlier placed significant advanced orders, rescheduled deliveries for a portion of such orders, to address their capital budget and capacity to absorb such inventory operationally. We expect our backlog to continue to reduce in fiscal 2024. As that happens, we expect our reliance upon securing quarterly book to revenue orders to grow and those orders to represent a more typical composition of our quarterly revenue over time. However, within these dynamics, our results for a particular period can be difficult to predict. These dynamics, as well as a range of factors, including those set forth below, can materially adversely affect quarterly revenue, gross margin, and operating results:\nchanges in spending levels or network deployment plans by customers, particularly with respect to our service provider and cloud provider customers;\norder timing and volume, including book to revenue orders;\nthe timing of revenue recognition on sales, particularly relating to large orders;\navailability of components and manufacturing capacity;\nshipment and delivery timing, including any deferral of delivery;\nbacklog levels;\nthe level of competition and pricing pressure in our industry;\nthe pace and impact of price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets;\nthe impact of commercial concessions or unfavorable commercial terms required to maintain incumbency or secure new opportunities with key customers;\nthe mix of revenue by product segment, geography, and customer in any particular quarter;\nour level of success in achieving targeted cost reductions and improved efficiencies in our supply chain;\nour incurrence of start-up costs, including lower margin phases of projects required to support initial deployments, gain new customers or enter new markets;\nour level of success in accessing new markets and obtaining new customers;\nlong- and short-term changing behaviors or customer needs that impact demand for our products and services or the products and services of our customers;\ntechnology-based price compression and our introduction of new platforms with improved price for performance;\nchanging market, economic, and political conditions, including the impact of tariffs and other trade restrictions or efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements;\nfactors beyond our control such as natural disasters, climate change, acts of war or terrorism, and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\nthe financial stability of our customers and suppliers;\nconsolidation activity among our customers, suppliers, and competitors;\ninstallation service availability and readiness of customer sites;\nadverse impact of foreign exchange; and\nseasonal effects in our business.\nAs a result of these factors and other conditions affecting our business and operating results, we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a good indication of future performance. Quarterly fluctuations from the above and other factors may cause our revenue, gross margin, and results of operations to underperform in relation to our guidance, long-term financial targets or the expectations of financial analysts or investors, which may cause volatility or decreases in our stock price.\nChallenges relating to supply chain dynamics, including semiconductor components, could adversely impact our growth, gross margins and financial results.\nIn the face of demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits, and other electronic components used in most of our products, experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent prior periods. As a result, we experienced significant component shortages, extended lead times, increased costs, and unexpected cancellation or delay of previously committed supply of key components across our supplier base. While reliability of supply has improved, extended lead times and elevated component costs could continue to adversely impact our revenue, our cost of goods sold, and our ability to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. It is unclear when the supply environment will fully stabilize and what impacts it will have on our business and results of operations in future periods. In addition, current geopolitical trends could impact the availability of components, and certain related export controls on critical minerals and semiconductor technology and chips could constrain supply and adversely impact both delivery and development of such components. This volatility has adversely affected, and could further affect, component availability, lead times and cost, which can adversely impact our revenue and have an impact on customer purchasing decisions. In an effort to address these risks, we have implemented mitigation strategies, including expanding manufacturing capacity, implementing multi-sourcing activities, qualifying alternative parts, and redesigning products; however, these efforts may fail to reduce the impact of adverse supply chain conditions. Supply chain challenges could also impact customer satisfaction or future business opportunities with customers, and result in increased use of cash, engineering design changes, and delays in new product introductions, each of which could adversely impact our business and financial results.\nA small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue. The loss of one or more of these customers or a significant reduction in their spending could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a small number of customers. For example, our ten largest customers contributed 53.7% of our revenue for fiscal 2023 and 56.3% of our revenue for fiscal 2022. Historically, our largest customers by revenue have principally consisted of large communications service providers. For example, a cloud provider customer accounted for approximately 12.8% of our revenue for fiscal 2023, AT&T accounted for approximately 10.6% of our revenue for fiscal 2023 and 11.9% of our revenue for fiscal 2022, and Verizon accounted for approximately 11.1% of our revenue for fiscal 2022. As a result of efforts in recent years to diversify our business, the customer segments and geographies that comprise our customer base and top customers by revenue have changed. During fiscal 2023, four cloud providers were among our top ten customers. Cloud provider customers have been important contributors to our revenue through both our direct sales to them, including for data center interconnection, and their indirect impact on purchases by other network operators. Consequently, our financial results and our ability to grow our business are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers. Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer within or outside of these customer segments as well as by reductions in spending or capital expenditure budgets, changes in network deployment plans or changes in consumption models for acquiring networking solutions by our largest customers.\nThere have been significant horizontal and vertical consolidation activities by communications service providers and cable operators. Customer consolidation can increase customer purchasing power and has in the past resulted in delays or reductions in network spending due to changes in strategy or leadership, the timing of regulatory approvals and high levels of debt taken on as a result of such transactions.\nBecause of our concentration of revenue with communications service providers and cloud providers, our business and results of operations can be significantly affected by market, industry, regulatory or competitive dynamics adversely affecting these customer segments. For example, communications service providers continue to face a rapidly shifting competitive landscape as cloud service operators, OTT providers, and other content providers continue to challenge their traditional business models and network infrastructures. These dynamics have in the past had an adverse effect on network spending levels by certain of our largest service provider customers. Several of these, including AT&T, have announced various initiatives that seek to modify how they purchase networking infrastructure or reduce capital expenditures on network infrastructure in future periods that may adversely affect our results of operations. Our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these factors and other market, industry or competitive dynamics adversely impacting our customers.\nWe face intense competition that could hurt our sales and results of operations, and we expect the competitive landscape in which we operate or intend to operate to continue to broaden to include additional solutions providers.\nWe face an intense competitive market for sales of communications networking equipment, software and services. Competition is intense on a global basis, as we and our competitors aggressively seek to capture market share and displace incumbent equipment vendors. Our industry has historically been dominated by a small number of very large vendors, some of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development resources, broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments than we do. In addition, to drive scale and market share gains and meet the intense investment capacity required to keep pace with technology innovation, acquisition activity among vendors of networking solutions has increased. Consolidation in our industry may result in competitors with greater resources, pricing flexibility, or other synergies, which may provide them with a competitive advantage.\nCertain of our customers are adopting procurement strategies that seek to purchase a broader set of networking solutions from two or more vendors. As these customers move to dual or multiple vendor strategies and add new vendors, we may lose our status as sole or primary vendor. We also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition for specific products, applications, customer segments or geographic markets. Due to the narrower focus of their efforts, these competitors may be more attractive to customers in a particular product niche or commercial opportunity.\nGenerally, competition in our markets is based on any one or a combination of the following factors:\nfunctionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;\nthe ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;\nprice for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions;\nincumbency and strength of existing business relationships;\ntechnology roadmap and forward innovation capacity, including the ability to invest significant sums in research and development;\ntime-to-market in delivering products and features;\ncompany stability and financial health;\nability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;\nflexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management;\nability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;\noperating costs and total cost of ownership;\nsoftware and network automation capabilities;\nability to manage challenging supply chain environments, including manufacturing and lead-time capability;\nservices and support capabilities;\nsecurity of enterprise, product development, support processes, and products;\nspace requirements and power consumption of network solutions; and\nability to offer solutions that help customers manage the lifecycle impacts of their networks and achieve their climate sustainability goals.\nPart of our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership and to aggressively capture additional market share and displace competitors, particularly with communications service providers internationally. In an effort to maintain our incumbency or to secure new customer opportunities, we have in the past, and may in the future, agree to aggressive pricing, commercial concessions and other unfavorable terms that result in low or negative gross margins on a particular order or group of orders. Competition can also result in onerous commercial and legal terms and conditions that place a disproportionate amount of risk on us.\nWe expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify, as we invest in complementary technologies or adjacent market opportunities, and as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will compete more directly with additional networking\nsolution suppliers, including IP router vendors, component vendors and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology. In addition, as we seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services, and as network operator demands for programmability, automation and analytics increase, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors and IT vendors or integrators of these solutions. We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, that develop networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as white box hardware, and as we pursue additional methods to bring the enabling technologies in our networking platforms to market. An increase in competitive intensity, the adoption of new consumption models, our entry into new markets or the entry of new competitors into our markets may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nInvestment of research and development resources in communications networking technologies for which there is not an adequate market demand, or failure to invest sufficiently or timely in technologies for which there is high market demand, would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nThe market for communications networking hardware and software solutions is characterized by rapidly evolving technologies, changes in market demand and increasing adoption of software-based networking solutions. We continually invest in research and development to sustain or enhance our existing hardware and software solutions and to develop or acquire new technologies including new software platforms. There is often a lengthy period between commencing these development initiatives and bringing new or improved solutions to market. Accordingly, there is no guarantee that our new products or enhancements to other solutions will achieve market acceptance or that the timing of market adoption will be as predicted. As a general matter, there is a significant possibility that some of our development decisions, including significant expenditures on acquisitions, research and development, or investments in technologies, will not meet our expectations, and that our investment in some projects will be unprofitable. There is also a possibility that we may miss a market opportunity because we failed to invest or invested too late in a technology, product or enhancement sought by our customers or the markets into which we sell. Changes in market demand or investment priorities may also cause us to discontinue existing or planned development for new products or features, which can have a disruptive effect on our relationships with customers. In addition, failure to develop, on a cost-effective basis, innovative new or enhanced solutions that are attractive to customers and profitable to us could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have no guaranteed purchases and regularly must re-win business for existing customers.\nGenerally, our customer contracts do not require customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed volumes, and we conduct sales through framework contracts under which customers place purchase orders for which they often have the right to modify or cancel. We must regularly compete for and win business with existing customers across all of our customer segments. In addition, cloud providers tend to operate on shorter procurement cycles than some of our traditional customers, which can require us to compete to re-win business with these customers more frequently than required with other customers segments. As such, there is no assurance that our incumbency will be maintained at any given customer or that our revenue levels from a customer in a particular period can be achieved in future periods. Customer spending levels can be unpredictable, and our sales to any customer could significantly decrease or cease at any time.\nNetwork equipment sales often involve lengthy sales cycles and protracted contract negotiations that may require us to agree to commercial terms or conditions that negatively affect pricing, risk allocation, payment and the timing of revenue recognition.\nOur sales efforts, particularly with communications service providers, cloud providers and other large customers, often involve lengthy sales cycles. These selling efforts often involve a significant commitment of time and resources that may include extensive product testing, laboratory or network certification, network or region-specific product certification and homologation requirements for deployment in networks. Even after a customer awards its business to us or decides to purchase our solutions, the length of time before deployment can vary depending on the customers schedule, site readiness, the size of the network deployment, the degree of custom configuration required and other factors. Additionally, these sales also often involve protracted and sometimes difficult contract negotiations in which we may deem it necessary to agree to unfavorable contractual or commercial terms that adversely affect pricing, expose us to penalties for delays or non-performance, and require us to assume a disproportionate amount of risk. To maintain incumbency with key customers, we have in the past and may in the future be required to offer discounted pricing, make commercial concessions or offer less favorable terms as compared to our historical business arrangements with these customers. We may also be requested to provide deferred payment terms, vendor or third-party financing or other alternative purchase structures that extend the timing of payment. Alternatively, customers may insist on terms and conditions that we deem too onerous or not in our best interest, and we may be unable to reach a commercial agreement. As a result, we may incur substantial expense and devote time and resources to potential sales opportunities that never materialize or result in lower than anticipated sales and gross margin.\nIf we are unable to adapt our business to the consumption models for networking solutions adopted by our customers and to offer attractive solutions across these consumption models, our business, competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nGrowing bandwidth demands and network operator efforts to reduce costs are resulting in a diverse range of approaches to the design and procurement of network infrastructure. We refer to these different approaches as consumption models. These consumption models can include: the traditional systems procurement of fully integrated solutions including acquiring hardware, software and services from the same vendor; the procurement of a fully integrated hardware solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operators own SDN-based controller; the procurement of an integrated photonic line system with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or disaggregated procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; or the development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of white box hardware to be used with open source software. In parallel, network operators are also exploring procurement alternatives for software solutions, ranging from integrated and proprietary software platforms to fully open source software.\nWe believe that network operators will continue to consider a variety of different consumption models. Many of these approaches are in their very early stages of development and evaluation, and the types of models and their levels of adoption will depend in significant part on the nature of the circumstances and strategies of particular network operators. Among our customers, AT&T, certain cloud providers and others are pursuing network strategies that emphasize enhanced software programmability, management and control of networks, and deployment of white box hardware. A number of network operators are pursuing the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, particularly within switching and routing solutions, as an alternative to integrated optical networking platforms. Other network operators, including certain of our cloud provider customers, are playing a leading role in the transition to software-defined networking, the standardization of communications network solutions and the assembly of their own hardware platforms based on enabling third party components. We believe that the potential for different approaches to the procurement of networking infrastructure will require network operators and vendors to evolve and broaden their existing solutions and commercial models over time. Adoption of a range of consumption models may also alter and broaden our competitive landscape to include other technology vendors, including routing vendors, component vendors and IT software vendors. If we are unable to adapt our business to these new consumption models and offer attractive solutions and commercial models that accommodate the range of consumption models ultimately adopted by our customers or within our markets, our business, competitive position and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur go-to-market activities and the distribution of our WaveLogic coherent modem technology within the market for high-performance transceivers/modems could expose us to increased or new forms of competition, or adversely affect our existing systems business and results of operations.\nWe recently entered the market for high-performance transceivers/modems to monetize our coherent optical technology, expand our addressable market and address a range of customer consumption models for networking solutions. Making our critical technology available in this manner could adversely impact the sale of products in our existing systems business. For example, our customers may choose to adopt disaggregated consumption models or third-party solutions that embed Ciena-designed optical modules instead of purchasing systems-based solutions from us. Accordingly, we may encounter situations where we are competing for opportunities in the market directly against a system from one of our competitors that incorporates Ciena-designed modules or other component technologies. Making this key technology available and enabling third-party sales of Ciena-designed modules may adversely affect our competitive position and increase the risk that third parties misappropriate or attempt to use our technology or related intellectual property without our authorization. These and other risks or unanticipated liabilities or costs associated with the sales of our WaveLogic coherent technology could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business and our results of operations. Our go-to-market activities and the distribution of our WaveLogic coherent technology within the market for high-performance transceivers/modems could expose us to increased or new forms of competition, or adversely affect our systems business and results of operation.\nAccurately matching necessary inventory levels to customer demand within the current environment is challenging, and we may incur additional costs or be required to write off significant inventory that would adversely impact our results of operations.\nFrom the second quarter of fiscal 2021 through the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we received unprecedented orders for our products and services, during a period when the supply environment was constrained. We took a number of steps to mitigate these challenges, including extending our purchase commitments and placing non-cancellable, advanced orders with or through suppliers, particularly for long lead-time components. As of October 28, 2023, we had $1.7 billion in outstanding purchase order commitments to our contract manufacturers and component suppliers for inventory. We also expanded our manufacturing capacity and accumulated available raw materials inventory to prepare us to be able to produce finished goods more quickly as supply constraints eased for those components in shorter supply. As a result of this strategy, our inventory increased from $374.3\nmillion at the end of of fiscal 2021 to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. These inventory practices and their associated costs, had in recent fiscal periods, and could in the future continue to have, an adverse impact on our cash from operations.\nThese inventory practices, particularly when considered in the context of our backlog, further introduce obsolescence risk that can impact our results of operations and financial condition. During fiscal 2023, certain customers, including communications service providers and cable and multiservice operators in North America and cloud providers, that had earlier placed significant advanced orders, rescheduled deliveries for a portion of such orders. Accordingly, our inventory needs for a particular period can fluctuate and be difficult to predict. If our customers were to cancel or delay orders for extended periods, inventory could become obsolete and we could be required to write off or write down the inventory associated with those orders. In addition, if customers were to cancel or delay existing or forecasted orders for which we have significant outstanding commitments to our contract manufacturers or suppliers, we may be required to purchase inventory under these commitments that we are unable to sell. If we are required to write off or write down a significant amount of inventory, our results of operations for the applicable period would be materially adversely affected. Our inability to effectively manage the matching of inventory with customer demand, particularly within any supply constrained environment, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition, and could result in loss of revenue, increased costs, or delays that could adversely impact customer satisfaction.\nIf the market for network software does not evolve in the way we anticipate or if customers do not adopt our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services, we may not be able to monetize these software assets and realize a key part of our business strategy.\nA key part of our business strategy is to increase customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software. If the markets relating to software solutions for network automation, including service orchestration, route optimization, analytics and assurance, and multi-cloud orchestration, do not develop as we anticipate, or if we are unable to commercialize, increase market awareness and gain adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services within those markets, revenue from our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services may not grow. We have a limited history in commercializing and selling these software solutions and we continue to build out the capability of our Blue Planet portfolio. Moreover, the market and competitive landscape for these solutions is dynamic, and it is difficult to predict important trends, including the potential growth, if any, of this market. If the market for these software solutions does not evolve in the way we anticipate or if customers do not adopt our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services, a part of our strategy for growth would be adversely affected and our financial results may suffer.\nOur exposure to the credit risks of our customers and resellers may make it difficult to collect receivables and could adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nIn the course of our sales to customers and resale channel partners, we may have difficulty collecting receivables, and our business and results of operations could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts. Lack of liquidity in the capital markets, macroeconomic weakness and market volatility may increase our exposure to these credit risks. Our attempts to monitor customer payment capability and to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves may not be sufficient, and it is possible that we may have to write down or write off accounts receivable. Such write-downs or write-offs could negatively affect our operating results for the period in which they occur, and, if large, could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results.\nWe may be required to write down the value of certain significant assets, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have a number of significant assets on our balance sheet as of October 28, 2023, the value of which can be adversely impacted by factors related to our business and operating performance, as well as factors outside of our control. As of October 28, 2023, our balance sheet includes a $809.3 million net deferred tax asset. The value of our net deferred tax assets can be significantly impacted by changes in tax policy, changes in future tax rates, or by our tax planning strategy. If any write-downs are required, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nAs of October 28, 2023, our balance sheet also includes $444.8 million of goodwill. We test each reporting unit for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests, if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. As of October 28, 2023, our balance sheet also includes $575.0 million in long-lived assets, which includes $205.6 million of intangible assets. Valuation of our long-lived assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products. These assumptions are used to forecast future, undiscounted cash flows on which our estimates are based. If market conditions or our forecasts for our business or any particular operating segment change, we may be required to reassess the value of these assets. We could be required to record an impairment charge against our goodwill and long-lived assets or a valuation allowance against our deferred\ntax assets. Any write-down of the value of these significant assets would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period. If we are required to take a substantial write-down or charge, our operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period.\nProblems affecting the performance, interoperability, reliability or security of our products could damage our business reputation and negatively affect our results of operations.\nThe development and production of sophisticated hardware and software for communications network equipment is highly complex. Some of our products can be fully tested only when deployed in communications networks or when carrying traffic with other equipment, and software products may contain bugs that can interfere with expected performance. As a result, undetected defects or errors, and product quality, interoperability, reliability, security and performance problems are often more acute for initial deployments of new products and product enhancements. We have recently launched, or are in the process of launching, a number of new hardware and software offerings, including new evolutions of our WaveLogic coherent optical modem technology and new Routing and Switching platforms and solutions targeting edge, access and aggregation networks. Unanticipated product performance problems can relate to the design, manufacturing, installation, operation and interoperability of our products. Undetected errors can also arise as a result of defects in components, software or manufacturing, installation or maintenance services supplied by third parties, and technology acquired from or licensed by third parties. From time to time, we have had to replace certain components, provide software remedies or other remediation in response to defects or bugs, and we may have to do so again in the future. Remediation of such events could materially adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we have encountered and may continue to encounter unanticipated security vulnerabilities relating to our technology, including as a result of the activities of our supply chain and our use of third party software. Our products are used in customer networks and transmit a range of sensitive information, and our software products, including our Blue Planet solutions, play an important role in managing network elements and delivering services. Communications technologies have frequently been the target of attacks from a range of threat actors including nation states and other malicious parties. Any actual or perceived exposure of our solutions to vulnerabilities, malicious software or cyber-attacks could result in liability or regulatory action and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Product performance, reliability, security and quality problems may result in some or all of the following effects:\ndamage to our reputation, declining sales and order cancellations;\nincreased costs to remediate defects or replace products;\npayment of liquidated damages, contractual or similar penalties, or other claims for performance failures or delays;\nincreased warranty expense or estimates resulting from higher failure rates, additional field service obligations or other rework costs related to defects;\nhigher charges for increased inventory obsolescence;\ndisruption to the operation of our network operator customers;\nreporting and other publication to customers or regulatory bodies;\ncosts, liabilities and claims that may not be covered by insurance coverage or recoverable from third parties; and\ndelays in recognizing revenue or collecting accounts receivable.\nThese and other consequences relating to undetected errors affecting the quality, reliability and security of our products could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nStrategic acquisitions and investments could disrupt our operations and may expose us to increased costs and unexpected liabilities.\nFrom time to time, we acquire or make investments in other technology companies, or enter into other strategic relationships, to expand the markets we address, diversify our customer base or acquire, or accelerate the development of, technology or products. To do so, we may use cash, issue equity that could dilute our current stockholders, or incur debt or assume indebtedness. Strategic transactions can involve numerous additional risks, including:\nfailure to consummate or delay in consummating such transactions;\nfailure to achieve the anticipated transaction benefits or the projected financial results and operational synergies;\ngreater than expected acquisition and integration costs;\ndisruption due to the integration and rationalization of operations, products, technologies and personnel;\ndiversion of management attention;\ndifficulty completing projects of the acquired company and costs related to in-process projects;\ndifficulty managing customer transitions or entering into new markets;\nthe loss of key employees;\ndisruption or termination of business relationships with customers, suppliers, vendors, landlords, licensors and other business partners;\nineffective internal controls over financial reporting;\ndependence on unfamiliar suppliers or manufacturers;\nassumption of or exposure to unanticipated liabilities, including intellectual property infringement or other legal claims; and\nadverse tax or accounting impact.\nAs a result of these and other risks, our acquisitions, investments or strategic transactions may not realize the intended benefits and may ultimately have a negative impact on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nEmerging issues related to the development and use of artificial intelligence (AI) could give rise to legal or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm of our business.\nOur development and use of AI technology in our products and operations remains in the early phases. While we aim to develop and use AI responsibly and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving and the technologies that we develop or use may ultimately be flawed. Moreover, AI technology is subject to rapidly evolving domestic and international laws and regulations, which could impose significant costs and obligations on the company. For example, in 2023 the Biden Administration issued a new, executive order on safe, secure and trustworthy AI and the EU introduced the AI Act to establish rules for providers and users. Emerging regulations may pertain to data privacy, data protection, and the ethical use of AI, as well as clarifying intellectual property considerations. Our use of AI could give rise to legal or regulatory action, increased scrutiny or liability, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\nRisks Relating to the Macroeconomic Environment and our Global Presence\nOur business and operating results could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in macroeconomic and market conditions and reductions in the level of spending by customers in response to these conditions.\nOur business and operating results depend significantly on general market and economic conditions. Market volatility and weakness in the regions in which we operate have previously resulted in sustained periods of decreased demand for our products and services that have adversely affected our operating results. The current global macroeconomic environment is volatile and continues to be significantly and adversely impacted by inflation, geopolitical trends impacting the global supply chain, rising interest rates, and a dynamic environment for customer spending. Macroeconomic and market conditions could also be adversely affected by a variety of political, economic or other factors in the United States and international markets that could in turn adversely affect spending levels of our customers and their end users, and could create volatility or deteriorating conditions in the markets in which we operate. Due to our concentration of revenue in the United States, we would expect to incur a more significant impact from any adverse change in the capital spending environment or macroeconomic or market weakness in the United States. Macroeconomic uncertainty or weakness could result in:\nreductions in customer spending and delay, deferral or cancellation of network infrastructure initiatives;\nincreased competition for fewer network projects and sales opportunities;\nincreased pricing pressure that may adversely affect revenue, gross margin and profitability;\ndecreased ability to forecast operating results and make decisions about budgeting, planning and future investments;\nincreased overhead and production costs as a percentage of revenue;\ntightening of credit markets needed to fund capital expenditures by us or our customers;\ncustomer financial difficulty, including order cancellations, delivery deferrals, longer collection cycles and difficulties collecting accounts receivable or write-offs of receivables;\nbusiness and financial difficulties faced by our suppliers or other partners, including impacts to material costs, sales, liquidity levels, ability to continue investing in their businesses, ability to import or export goods, ability to meet development commitments and manufacturing capability; and\nincreased risk of charges relating to excess and obsolete inventories and the write-off of other intangible assets.\nEach of our customers has a unique set of circumstances, and it is unclear how macroeconomic and market conditions may continue to impact their purchasing volumes or behaviors. Reductions in customer spending in response to unfavorable or uncertain macroeconomic and market conditions, globally or in a particular region where we operate, would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe international scale of our sales and operations exposes us to additional risk and expense that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe market, sell and service our products globally, maintain personnel in numerous countries, and rely on a global supply chain for sourcing important components and manufacturing our products. Our international sales and operations are subject to inherent risks, including:\nadverse social, political and economic conditions, such as continued inflation and rising interest rates;\neffects of adverse changes in currency exchange rates;\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\ndifficulty and cost of staffing and managing foreign operations;\nhigher incidence and risk of corruption or unethical business practices;\nless protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\ntax and customs changes that adversely impact our global sourcing strategy, manufacturing practices, transfer-pricing, or competitiveness of our products for global sales;\ncompliance with certain testing, homologation or customization of products to conform to local standards;\nsignificant changes to free trade agreements, trade protection measures, tariffs and other import measures, export compliance, economic sanctions measures, domestic preference procurement requirements, qualification to transact business and additional regulatory requirements;\nnatural disasters (including as a result of climate change), acts of war or terrorism, and public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic; and\nuncertain economic, legal and political conditions in Europe, Asia and other regions where we do business, including, for example, as a result of continued impacts of Brexit on the relationship between the United Kingdom and Europe, the ongoing military conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and Israel and Hamas, and changes in China-Taiwan and U.S.-China relations.\nWe utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials that has direct or indirect dependencies upon a number of vendors with operations in the Asia-Pacific region. We also rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products. Physical, regulatory, technological, market, reputational, and legal risks related to climate change in these regions and globally are increasing in impact and diversity and the magnitude of any short-term or long-term adverse impact on our business or results of operations remains unknown. The physical impacts of climate change, including as a result of certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intensity or changing weather patterns, could disrupt our supply chain, result in damage to or closures of our facilities, and could otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition. See also the risk factor below entitled Government regulations related to the environment, climate change and social initiatives could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur international operations are subject to complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations, including anti-bribery and corruption laws, antitrust or competition laws, data privacy laws, such as the GDPR, and environmental regulations, among others. In particular, recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, and we currently operate and seek to operate in many parts of the world that are recognized or perceived as having greater potential for corruption. Violations of any of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to offer our products and services in certain geographies, and significant harm to our business reputation. Our policies and procedures to promote compliance with these laws and regulations and to mitigate these risks may not protect us from all acts committed by our employees or third-party vendors, including contractors, agents and services partners or from the misinterpretation or changing application of such laws. Additionally, the costs of complying with these laws (including the costs of investigations, auditing and monitoring) could adversely affect our current or future business.\nOur business, operations and financial results could also be adversely impacted by instability, disruption or destruction in a significant geographic region, including as a result of war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest; natural or man-made disasters; public health emergencies; or economic instability or weakness. For example, in February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The United States and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions, which could damage or disrupt international commerce and the global economy. We are complying with a broad range of U.S. and international sanctions and export control requirements imposed on Russia and, in March 2022, we announced our decision to suspend our business operations in Russia immediately. Although this decision did not materially impact our results of operations for fiscal 2022 or 2023 due to the limited amount of business that we conducted in Russia historically, it is not possible to predict the broader or longer-term consequences of this conflict, which could include further sanctions, export control and import restrictions, embargoes, regional instability, geopolitical shifts and adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, security conditions, currency exchange rates and financial markets. Such geopolitical instability and uncertainty could have a negative impact on our ability to sell to, ship products to, collect payments from, and support customers in certain countries and regions based on trade restrictions, sanctions, embargoes and export control law restrictions, and\nlogistics restrictions including closures of air space, and could increase the costs, risks and adverse impacts from supply chain and logistics challenges.\nThe success of our international sales and operations will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks effectively. Our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our international operations, reduce our international sales, and could give rise to liabilities, costs or other business difficulties that could adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nEfforts to increase our sales and capture market share in targeted international markets may be unsuccessful.\nPart of our business and growth strategy is to expand our geographic reach and increase market share in international markets through a combination of direct and indirect sales resources. We are also aggressively pursuing opportunities with service provider customers in additional geographies, including EMEA and APAC. This diversification of our markets and customer base has been a significant component of the growth of our business in recent years. Our efforts to continue to increase our sales and capture market share in international markets may ultimately be unsuccessful or may adversely impact our financial results, including our gross margin. Our failure to continue to increase our sales and market share in international markets could limit our growth and could harm our results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nAs a company with global operations, we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Due to our global presence, a portion of our revenue, operating expense and assets and liabilities are non-U.S. Dollar denominated and therefore subject to foreign currency fluctuation. We face exposure to currency exchange rates as a result of the growth in our non-U.S. Dollar denominated operating expense in Canada, Europe, Asia and Latin America. An increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the United States where we sell in U.S. Dollars, and a weakened U.S. Dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of materials or service that we purchase in foreign currencies. From time to time, we hedge against currency exposure associated with anticipated foreign currency cash flows or assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency. Such attempts to offset the impact of currency fluctuations are costly, and we cannot hedge against all foreign exchange rate volatility. Losses associated with these hedging instruments and the adverse effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation may negatively affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Operations and Reliance on Third Parties\nWe may experience delays in the development and production of our products that may negatively affect our competitive position and business.\nOur hardware and software networking solutions, including our WaveLogic modem technology and the components thereof, are based on complex technology, and we can experience unanticipated delays in developing, manufacturing and introducing these solutions to market. Delays in product development efforts by us or our supply chain may affect our reputation with customers, affect our ability to capture market opportunities and impact the timing and level of demand for our products. We are regularly introducing new products and enhancements and each step in their development cycle presents serious risks of failure, rework or delay, any one of which could adversely affect the cost-effectiveness and timely development of our products. Reworks, in particular, if required, can be a very expensive and time-consuming effort. We may encounter delays relating to engineering development activities and software, design, sourcing and manufacture of critical components, and the development of prototypes. The development of new technologies may increase the complexity of supply chain management or require the acquisition, licensing or interworking with the technology of third parties. In addition, intellectual property disputes, failure of critical design elements and other execution risks may delay or even prevent the release of these products. If we do not successfully develop or produce products in a timely manner, our competitive position may suffer, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected by risks associated with their businesses, financial condition, and the geographies in which they operate.\nWe rely on third-party contract manufacturers, including those with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand, and the United States, to perform a substantial portion of our supply chain activities, including component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products. There are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers, including:\nreduced control over delivery schedules and planning;\nreliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties;\npotential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs;\navailability of manufacturing capability and capacity, particularly during periods of high demand;\nthe impact of wage inflation and labor shortages on cost;\nthe impact of supply chain constraints on our contract manufacturers costs and business models;\nrisks associated with the ability of our contract manufacturers to perform to our manufacturing needs;\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the locations or countries where our products are manufactured, including manufacturing disruptions caused by social, geopolitical, environmental, or health factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\nrisks associated with data security incidents, including disruptions, interdiction, or cyber-attacks targeting or affecting our third-party manufacturers, including manufacturing disruptions or unauthorized access to or acquisition of information;\nchanges in law or policy governing tax, trade, manufacturing, development, and investment in the countries where we currently manufacture our products, including the World Trade Organization Information Technology Agreement or other free trade agreements;\ninventory liability for excess and obsolete supply;\nlimited warranties provided to us; and\npotential misappropriation of our intellectual property.\nIf our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products or components of our products, or if we experience a disruption in manufacturing, we may be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers, which could cause us to be delayed in or unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers. The process of qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time-consuming, and if we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer, we would likely experience significant business disruption, and could lose revenue and damage our existing customer relationships. These and other risks associated with our contract manufacturers businesses, financial condition, and the geographies in which they operate could impair our ability to fulfill orders, harm our sales and impact our reputation with customers in ways that adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur reliance on third-party component suppliers, including sole and limited source suppliers, exposes our business to additional risk, including risk relating to our suppliers businesses and financial position and risks arising as a result of geopolitical events, and could limit our sales, increase our costs and harm our customer relationships.\nWe maintain a global sourcing strategy and depend on a diverse set of third-party suppliers in international markets that comprise our supply chain. We rely on these third parties for activities relating to product design, development and support, and in the sourcing of products, components, subcomponents and related raw materials. Our products include optical and electronic components for which reliable, high-volume supply is often available only from sole or limited sources. We do not have any guarantees of supply from our third-party suppliers, and in certain cases we have limited contractual arrangements or are relying on standard purchase orders. In recent periods, delays and lower-than-expected deliveries from a small group of our suppliers of integrated circuit components that are essential for delivering finished products had a disproportionate, adverse impact on our results of operations. There is no assurance that we will be able to secure the components or subsystems that we require, in sufficient quantity and quality, within our preferred timelines and on reasonable terms.\nThe loss of a source of supply, or lack of sufficient availability of key components, could require that we locate an alternate source or redesign our products, either of which could result in business interruption and increased costs. Increases in market demand or scarcity of raw materials or components have resulted, and may in the future result, in shortages in availability of important components for our solutions, supply allocation challenges, deployment delays and increased cost, lead times and delivery cycle timelines. There are a number of significant technology trends or developments underway or emerging - including the IoT, autonomous vehicles, and advances in mobile communications such as 5G technologies - that have previously resulted in, and we believe will continue to result in, increased market demand for key raw materials or components upon which we rely.\nA number of our key technology vendors rely upon sales to customers, including our competitors, in China for a material portion of their revenue. Recently, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events, including trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the United States and China. In May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the EAR by adding Huawei and certain affiliates to the Entity List for actions contrary to the national security and foreign policy interests of the United States, imposing significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. In August 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce added additional Huawei affiliates to the Entity List, confirmed the expiration of a temporary general license applicable to Huawei and amended the foreign direct product rule in a manner that represents a significant expansion of its application to Huawei. More recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce has expanded the scope of the EAR by amending the foreign direct product rule, resulting in more products made outside the United States becoming subject to the EAR for purposes of exports or transfers to certain\ncountries and/or parties, which increases compliance risks and licensing obligations for companies dealing with such products. Several of our third-party component suppliers, including certain sole and limited source suppliers, sell products to Huawei and, in some cases, Huawei is a significant customer for such suppliers. At this time, there can be no assurance regarding the scope or duration of these restrictions, including the foreign direct product rule, or further actions imposed on Huawei and other companies located and operating in China, and any future impact on our suppliers. Any continued restriction on our suppliers ability to make sales to Huawei and other companies may adversely impact their businesses and financial position. In addition, China is in the midst of executing a five-year plan to improve Chinas capabilities in the optoelectronics industry. There can be no assurance that this initiative, or similar efforts in China such as the Made in China 2025 initiatives (and actions taken by the U.S. government in response to such efforts), will not have an adverse impact on the business of our suppliers or our access to necessary components. These and similar industry, market and regulatory disruptions affecting our suppliers could, in turn, expose our business to loss or lack of supply or discontinuation of components that could result in lost revenue, additional product costs, increased lead times and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships. Our business and results of operations would be negatively affected if we were to experience any significant disruption or difficulties with key suppliers affecting the price, quality, availability or timely delivery of required components.\nWe rely on third-party resellers and distribution partners to sell our solutions, and on third-party service partners for installation, maintenance and support functions, and our failure to develop and manage these relationships effectively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and relationships with our customers.\nIn order to sell into new markets, diversify our customer base and broaden the application for our solutions, and to complement our global field resources, we rely on a number of third-party resellers, distribution partners and sales agents, both domestic and international, and we believe that these relationships are an important part of our business. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify and qualify these resources or that we will realize the expected benefits of these sales relationships.\nWe also rely on a number of third-party service partners, both domestic and international, to complement our global service and support resources. We rely on these partners for certain installation, maintenance and support functions. In addition, as network operators increasingly seek to rely on vendors to perform additional services relating to the design, construction and operation of their networks, the scope of work performed by our support partners is likely to increase and may include areas where we have less experience providing or managing such services. We must successfully identify, assess, train and certify qualified service partners in order to ensure the proper installation, deployment and maintenance of our products, as well as to ensure the skillful performance of other services associated with expanded solutions offerings, including site assessment and construction-related services.\nCertain service partners may provide similar services for other companies, including our competitors. We may not be able to manage our relationships with our service partners effectively, and we cannot be certain that they will be able to deliver services in the manner or time required, that we will be able to maintain the continuity of their services, or that they will adhere to our approach to ethical business practices. We may also be exposed to a number of risks or challenges relating to the performance of our service partners, including:\ndelays in recognizing revenue;\nliability for injuries to persons, damage to property or other claims relating to the actions or omissions of our service partners;\nour services revenue and gross margin may be adversely affected; and\nour relationships with customers could suffer.\nAs our service offering expands and customers look to identify vendors capable of managing, integrating and optimizing multi-domain, multi-vendor networks with unified software, our relationships with third-party service partners will become increasingly important.\nWe must also assess and certify or qualify third-party resellers, distribution partners, sales agents and service partners in order to ensure their understanding of and willingness and ability to adhere to our standards of conduct and business ethics. Vetting and certification of these resellers, agents and distribution and service partners can be costly and time-consuming. Certain resellers, agents and distribution and service partners may not have the same operational history, financial resources and scale that we have.\nIf we do not effectively identify, develop and manage our relationships with third-party resellers, distribution partners, sales agents or service partners, or if they fail to perform services in the manner or time required, our financial results and relationships with customers could be adversely affected. We may also be held responsible or liable for the actions or omissions of these third parties. Actions, omissions or violations of law by our third-party sales partners or agents or service partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may be exposed to unanticipated risks and additional obligations in connection with our resale of complementary products or technology of other companies.\nWe have entered into agreements with strategic supply partners that permit us to distribute their products or technology. We may rely on these relationships to add complementary products or technologies, to diversify our product portfolio, or to address a particular customer or geographic market. We may enter into additional OEM, resale or similar strategic arrangements in the future. We may incur unanticipated costs or difficulties relating to our resale of third-party products. Our third-party relationships could expose us to risks associated with the business, financial condition, intellectual property rights and supply chain continuity of such partners, as well as delays in their development, manufacturing or delivery of products or technology. We may also be required by customers to assume warranty, indemnity, service and other commercial obligations, including potential liability to customers, greater than the commitments, if any, made to us by our technology partners. Some of our strategic supply partners are relatively small companies with limited financial resources. If they are unable to satisfy their obligations to us or our customers, we may have to expend our own resources to satisfy these obligations. Exposure to these risks could harm our reputation with key customers and could negatively affect our business and our results of operations.\nGrowth of our business is dependent on the proper functioning and scalability of our internal business processes and information systems. Adoption of new systems, modifications or interruptions of services may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls.\nWe rely on a number of internal business processes and information systems to support key business functions, and the efficient operation of these processes and systems is critical to managing our business. Our business processes and information systems must be sufficiently scalable to support the growth of our business and may require modifications or upgrades that expose us to a number of operational risks. We continually pursue initiatives to transform and optimize our business operations through the reengineering of certain processes, investment in automation, and engagement of strategic partners or resources to assist with certain business functions. For example, to enhance operational efficiency and modernize our supply chain operations, we are pursuing a number of digital technology transformation efforts, including advanced analytics, automation, and other digital solutions. In addition, our business may begin to operate in new markets and through new supply chain models that may require different internal processes to manage. These changes require a significant investment of capital and human resources and may be costly and disruptive to our operations, and they could impose substantial demands on management time. These changes may also require changes in our information systems, modification of internal control procedures and significant training of employees or third-party resources. Our IT systems, and those of third-party IT providers or business partners, may also be vulnerable to damage or disruption caused by circumstances beyond our control, including catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters (including as a result of climate change), data security related incidents, and computer system or network failures. There can be no assurance that our business systems or those of our third-party business partners will not be subject to similar incidents, exposing us to significant cost, reputational harm and disruption or damage to our business.\nRestructuring activities could disrupt our business and affect our results of operations.\nWe have taken steps, including reductions in force, office closures, and internal reorganizations to reduce the cost of our operations, improve efficiencies, or realign our organization and staffing to better match our market opportunities and our technology development initiatives. We may take similar steps in the future as we seek to realize operating synergies, to achieve our target operating model and profitability objectives, or to reflect more closely changes in the strategic direction of our business or the evolution of our site strategy and workplace. These changes could be disruptive to our business, including our research and development efforts, and could result in significant expense, including accounting charges for inventory and technology-related write-offs, workforce reduction costs and charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities. Substantial expense or charges resulting from restructuring activities could adversely affect our results of operations and use of cash in those periods in which we undertake such actions.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to manage our business effectively.\nOur future success and ability to maintain a technology leadership position depends upon our ability to recruit and retain the services of executive, engineering, sales and marketing, and support personnel. Competition to attract and retain highly skilled technical, engineering and other personnel with experience in our industry is intense, and our employees have been the subject of targeted hiring by our competitors. Competition is particularly intense in certain jurisdictions where we have research and development centers, including the Silicon Valley area of northern California, and for engineering talent generally. The lasting impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in higher employee costs, increased attrition, and significant shifts in the labor market and employee expectations. We may experience difficulty retaining and motivating existing employees and attracting qualified personnel to fill key positions. In addition, labor shortages and employee mobility may make it more difficult to hire and retain employees. There can be no assurance that the programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition that are part of our annual people strategy will be successful in attracting and retaining the talent necessary to execute on our business plans.\nBecause we rely on equity awards as a significant component of compensation, particularly for our executive team, a lack of positive performance in our stock price, reduced grant levels, or changes to our compensation program may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain key employees. In addition, none of our executive officers is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. We have a number of workforce planning initiatives underway and our failure to manage these programs effectively could result in the loss of key personnel. Similarly, the failure to properly manage the necessary knowledge transfer required from these employee transitions could impact our ability to maintain industry and innovation leadership. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, we may be unable to manage our business effectively, and our operations and financial results could suffer.\nIn addition, a number of our team members are foreign nationals who rely on visas or work-entry permits in order to legally work in the United States and other countries. Changes in government policy and global events such as pandemics may interfere with our ability to hire or retain personnel who require these visas or entry permits. Changes in immigration policy, including the implementation of restrictive interpretations by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services of regulatory requirements for H-1B, L-1 and other U.S. work visa categories, may also adversely affect our ability to hire or retain key talent, which could have an impact on our business operations.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Litigation, Regulation and Government Policy\nOur intellectual property rights may be difficult and costly to enforce.\nWe generally rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our products and technology. Although we have been issued numerous patents, and other patent applications are currently pending, there can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or that our rights will provide us with any competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that patents will be issued for our pending applications or that claims allowed on any patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Further, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe are subject to the risk that third parties may attempt to access, divert or use our intellectual property without authorization. We are also vulnerable to third parties who illegally distribute or sell counterfeit, stolen, or unfit versions of our products, which could have a negative impact on our reputation and business. Protecting against the unauthorized use of our products, technology and other proprietary rights is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect, prevent or minimize the risks of such unauthorized use. In addition, our intellectual property strategy must continually evolve to protect our proprietary rights in new solutions, including our software solutions. Litigation may be necessary to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management time and resources, and there can be no assurance that we will obtain a successful result. Any inability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our ability to compete effectively.\nWe may incur significant costs in response to claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights.\nFrom time to time third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings related to patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are relevant to our business. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. The rate of infringement assertions by patent assertion entities is increasing, particularly in the United States. Generally, these patent owners neither manufacture nor use the patented invention directly, and they seek to derive value from their ownership solely through royalties from patent licensing programs.\nWe could be adversely affected by litigation, other proceedings or claims against us, as well as claims against our manufacturers, suppliers or customers, alleging infringement of third-party proprietary rights by our products and technology, or components thereof. Regardless of the merit of these claims, they can be time-consuming, divert the time and attention of our technical and management personnel, and result in costly litigation or otherwise require us to incur substantial costs, including legal fees. These claims, if successful, could require us to:\npay substantial damages or royalties;\ncomply with an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain of our products;\nseek a license for the use of certain intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\ndevelop non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense and ultimately may not be successful; and\nindemnify our customers or other third parties pursuant to contractual obligations to hold them harmless or pay expenses or damages on their behalf.\nAny of these events could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions, as we would have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to the acquired technology and the steps taken to safeguard against the risks of infringing the rights of third parties.\nOur products incorporate software and other technology under license from third parties, and our business would be adversely affected if this technology were no longer available to us on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe integrate third-party software and other technology into our operating system, network management, and intelligent automation software and other products. As a result, we may be required to license certain software or technology from third parties, including competitors. Licenses for software or other technology may not be available or may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Third-party licensors may insist on unreasonable financial or other terms in connection with our use of such technology. Our failure to comply with the terms of any license may result in our inability to continue to use such license, which may result in significant costs, harm our market opportunities and require us to obtain or develop a substitute technology.\nSome of our solutions, including our operating system software, Platform Software, and Blue Planet Automation Software, utilize elements of open source or publicly available software. As network operators seek to enhance programmability and automation of networks, we expect that we and other communications networking solutions vendors will increasingly contribute to and use technology or open source software developed by standards setting bodies or other industry forums that seek to promote the integration of network layers and functions. The terms of such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. This increases our risks associated with our use of such software and may require us to seek licenses from third parties, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of such solutions. Difficulty obtaining and maintaining technology licenses with third parties may disrupt development of our products, increase our costs and adversely affect our business.\nData security breaches and cyber-attacks targeting our enterprise technology environment and assets could compromise our intellectual property, technology or other sensitive information and cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operational capacity.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, our network environment and assets, and the networks and assets of our third-party business partners, including our supply chain and other vendors, maintain certain information that is confidential, regulated, proprietary or otherwise sensitive in nature to our business. This information may include intellectual property and product information, personal data, financial information and other confidential business information relating to us and our employees, customers, suppliers and other business partners. The frequency, sophistication and unpredictability of cybersecurity events globally have increased, and can be more acute during times of geopolitical tension or instability between countries. In addition, companies in the technology industry, and in particular, manufacturers of networking and communications products, have been increasingly subjected to a wide variety of data security incidents, including cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to network asset, infrastructure or sensitive information. Our network systems, devices, storage and other business applications, and the systems, storage and other business applications that we rely on and that are maintained by our third-party providers, have been in the past, and may be in the future, subjected to security incidents including attack, exploitation, intrusion, disruption and other malfeasance or attempts to gain unauthorized access or conduct other unauthorized activities. Such data security incidents may be caused by malice or negligence from either third party or internal actors. These threats arise from actions by nation states, independent hackers, hacktivist groups, organized cybercrime entities, and other third parties, as well as from malicious actors from within or supporting our organization. In some cases, it is difficult to anticipate, detect or identify indicators of such incidents and assess the damage caused thereby. If an actual or perceived data security incident affects our network or any of our third-party providers networks, we could incur significant costs, our technology and operations could be impacted, our customers and other stakeholders could be impacted, our reputation could be harmed, and we may become involved in litigation, including with respect to allegations of breach of contract. We may also be subject to increased regulatory oversight, including governmental investigations, enforcement actions, and regulatory fines. We could also experience delays in reporting our financial results, and we may lose revenue and profits as a result of our inability to timely produce, distribute, invoice, and collect payments for our products and services. Additionally, a data security incident may result in significant remediation expenses and increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs.\nWhile we work to safeguard our enterprise network systems and to validate the security of our third-party providers to mitigate these potential risks, including through information security policies, employee awareness and training and other technical, procedural and administrative controls, there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent future data security incidents or insider threats. We have been subjected in the past, and expect to be subjected in the future, to a range of incidents including phishing, emails purporting to come from a company executive or vendor seeking payment requests, malware, and communications from look-alike corporate domains, as well as security-related risks created by malicious internal actors internally and our use of third-party software and services. We have also been subject to unauthorized access and exfiltration of confidential data as a result of the exploitation of zero day vulnerabilities involving our use of third-party applications. While these types of incidents to which we have been subjected have not had a material effect on our business, technology, operations or our network security to date, future data security incidents could compromise material confidential or otherwise protected information, seize, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations or impact our customers or other stakeholders. We and our network environment may also be subject in the future to ransomware attacks, nation-state cyber attacks or other types of cyber attacks. A failure to promptly disclose such material incidents as required by law may result in additional financial or regulatory consequences. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and data protection standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards and contractual obligations. Increased regulation of data collection, use and retention practices, including self-regulation and industry standards, changes in existing laws and regulations, enactment of new laws and regulations, increased enforcement activity, and changes in interpretation of laws, could increase our cost of compliance and operation. And while we may be entitled to damages if our third-party providers fail to satisfy their security-related obligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. While we have purchased cybersecurity insurance, there are no assurances that the coverage would be adequate in relation to any incurred losses. Moreover, as cyber-attacks increase in frequency and magnitude, we may be unable to obtain cybersecurity insurance in amounts and on terms we view as adequate for our operations.\nWe are a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determined adversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures, or prevent us from taking certain actions, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nIn the course of our business, we are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings, investigations and other claims or disputes, which have related and may relate to subjects including commercial transactions, intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Legal proceedings and investigations are inherently uncertain, and we cannot predict their duration, scope, outcome or consequences. There can be no assurance that these or any such matters that have been or may in the future be brought against us will be resolved favorably. In connection with any government investigations, in the event the government takes action against us or the parties resolve or settle the matter, we may be required to pay substantial fines or civil and criminal penalties and/or be subject to equitable remedies, including disgorgement or injunctive relief. Other legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits filed by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. These matters are likely to be expensive and time-consuming to defend, settle and/or resolve, and may require us to implement certain remedial measures that could prove costly or disruptive to our business and operations. They may also cause damage to our business reputation. The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nChanges in trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and other import measures, increased export control and investment restrictions, and efforts to withdraw from or materially modify international trade agreements, as well as other regulatory efforts impacting the import and sale of foreign equipment, may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nThe United States and various foreign governments have established certain trade and tariff requirements under which we have implemented a global approach to the sourcing and manufacture of our products, as well as distribution and fulfillment to customers around the world. From time to time, the U.S. government has indicated a willingness to revise, renegotiate, or terminate various existing multilateral trade agreements and to impose new taxes and restrictions on certain goods imported into the U.S. Because we rely on a global sourcing strategy and third-party contract manufacturers in markets outside of the U.S. to perform substantially all of the manufacturing of our products, such steps, if adopted, could adversely impact our business and operations, increase our costs, and make our products less competitive in the U.S. and other markets.\nFor example, our supply chain includes certain direct and indirect suppliers based in China who supply goods to us, our manufacturers or our third-party suppliers. Recently, there have been a number of significant geopolitical events, including trade tensions and regulatory actions, involving the governments of the United States and China. The U.S. government has raised tariffs, and imposed new tariffs, on a wide range of imports of Chinese products, including component elements of our solutions and certain finished goods products that we sell. U.S. tariff policy involving imports from China are slated for a broad review in 2023. The U.S. government has also introduced broad new restrictions on imports from China allegedly manufactured with\nforced labor, and the EU has debated similar restrictions, while other countries are debating or have introduced similar restrictions on imports of goods produced in whole or in part with the use of forced labor. China has retaliated by raising tariffs, and imposing new tariffs, on certain exports of U.S. goods to China, as well as introducing blocking measures to restrict the ability of domestic companies to comply with U.S. trade restrictions and could take further steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies. In May 2020, the U.S. introduced significant further restrictions limiting access to controlled U.S. technology to additional Chinese government and commercial entities, including certain of our competitors based in China. More recently, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed additional export control restrictions targeting the provision of certain semiconductors and related technology to China that could further disrupt supply chains that could adversely impact our business. In addition, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) in November 2022 prohibited communications equipment deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to national security from obtaining the equipment authorization that allows the products to be imported, marketed, or sold in the U.S. This prohibition currently includes telecommunications equipment produced by Huawei and its affiliates and subsidiaries and four other Chinese companies, and additional entities may be subsequently added to this list. The situation involving U.S.-China trade relations remains volatile and uncertain, and there can be no assurance that further actions by either country will not have an adverse impact on our business, operations and access to technology, or components thereof, sourced from China. See also the risk factor with the caption beginning Our reliance on third-party component suppliers\u2026 above.\nAt this time, it remains unclear what additional actions, if any, will be taken by the U.S. or other governments with respect to international trade agreements, the imposition of tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., tax policy related to international commerce, increased export control and investment restrictions, import or use of foreign communications equipment, or other trade matters. Based on our manufacturing practices and locations, there can be no assurance that any future executive or legislative action in the United States or other countries relating to tax policy and trade regulation would not adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nGovernment regulation of usage, import or export of our products, or our technology within our products, changes in that regulation, or our failure to obtain required approvals for our products, could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue and costs of sales. Failure to comply with such regulations could result in enforcement actions, fines, penalties or restrictions on export privileges. In addition, costly tariffs on our equipment, restrictions on importation, trade protection measures and domestic preference requirements of certain countries could limit our access to these markets and harm our sales. These regulations could adversely affect the sale or use of our products, substantially increase our cost of sales and adversely affect our business and revenue.\nChanges in government regulations affecting the communications and technology industries and the businesses of our customers could harm our prospects and operating results.\nThe FCC has jurisdiction over many companies in the U.S. telecommunications industry, and similar agencies have jurisdiction over the communications industries in other countries. Many of our largest customers, including service providers and cable and multiservice network operators, are subject to the rules and regulations of these agencies, while others participate in and benefit from government-funded programs that encourage the deployment of network infrastructures. These regulatory requirements and funding programs are subject to changes that may adversely impact our customers, with resulting adverse impacts on our business.\nIn December 2017, the FCC repealed most of the net neutrality rules prohibiting blocking, degrading, or prioritizing certain types of internet traffic that it had imposed in 2015, and restored a light touch regulatory treatment of broadband service. The 2017 decision was partially upheld in October 2020 by an appellate court, although the 2020 decision vacated the specific preemption provision in the 2017 order. In October 2023, the FCC proposed to reclassify broadband internet access service (BIAS) as a Title II telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act and reinstate net neutrality obligations on BIAS providers. The impact of these rules, if adopted, remains uncertain and further judicial review is likely. A number of states, including California, have also taken executive action or passed legislation seeking to reestablish net neutrality, and there are efforts within Congress to pass federal legislation to codify uniform net neutrality requirements.\nChanges in regulatory requirements or uncertainty associated with the regulatory environment could delay or serve as a disincentive to investment in network infrastructures by network operators, which could adversely affect the sale of our products and services. Similarly, changes in regulatory tariff requirements or other regulations relating to pricing or terms of carriage on communications networks could slow the development or expansion of network infrastructures and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nSeparately, certain of our cloud provider customers have been the subject of regulatory and other government actions, including inquiries and investigations, formal or informal, by competition authorities in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions. In July 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice announced that it would commence an antitrust review into significant\nonline technology platforms, and in September 2019, various state attorneys general announced antitrust investigations involving certain technology companies. In addition, certain committees of the U.S. Congress have recently held hearings and pursued investigations to consider the businesses associated with these platforms, their impact on competition, and their conduct. There can be no assurance that these government actions will not adversely impact the network spending, procurement strategies, or business practices of our cloud provider customers in a manner adverse to us.\nGovernment regulations related to the environment, climate change and social initiatives could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nOur operations are regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws relating to the environment and climate change. If we were to violate or become liable under these laws or regulations, we could incur fines, costs related to damage to property or personal injury and costs related to investigation or remediation activities. Our product design efforts and the manufacturing of our products are also subject to evolving requirements relating to the presence of certain materials or substances in our equipment, including regulations that make producers for such products financially responsible for the collection, treatment and recycling of certain products. For example, our operations and financial results may be negatively affected by environmental regulations, such as the WEEE and RoHS regulations that have been adopted by the EU. Compliance with these and similar environmental regulations may increase our cost of designing, manufacturing, selling and removing our products. The SEC requires disclosure regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the DRC) and disclosure with respect to procedures regarding a manufacturers efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals from the DRC. Certain of these minerals are present in our products. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect of reducing the pool of suppliers that can supply conflict free components and parts, and we may not be able to obtain conflict free products or supplies in sufficient quantities for our operations. Because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to verify sufficiently the origins for the conflict minerals used in our products and cannot assert that our products are conflict free. Environmental or similar social initiatives may also make it difficult to obtain supply of compliant components or may require us to write off non-compliant inventory, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nInvestor and other stakeholder scrutiny related to our environmental, social and governance practices, and our disclosed performance and aspirations for these practices, may increase costs and expose us to numerous risks.\nInvestors, business partners, employees, legislators, regulators, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on ESG matters, including our ESG practices. As expectations have grown, we have established and communicated various initiatives, goals and aspirations related to ESG matters. Any disclosed goals and aspirations reflect our current plans and assumptions, are subject to assumptions that could change over time, and may not be achieved. In addition, the standards and laws by which ESG efforts are tracked and measured are in many cases new, have not been harmonized, and continue to evolve. Our efforts to abide by these standards and laws and to accomplish and accurately report on our initiatives, goals and aspirations present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our processes and controls may not always align with evolving standards, our interpretation of standards may differ from others, and standards may continue to change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals, our reported progress toward those goals, or other ESG information we disclose. In addition, any failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our previously stated goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions, private litigation and reputational harm.\nChanges in tax law or regulation, effective tax rates and other adverse outcomes with taxing authorities could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. The impact of income taxes on our business can also be affected by a number of items relating to our business. These may include estimates for and the actual geographic mix of our earnings; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets; the use or expiration of net operating losses or research and development credit arrangements applicable to us in certain geographies; and changes in our methodology for transfer pricing, valuing developed technology or conducting intercompany arrangements.\nAdditionally, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the OECD) has introduced a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15%, referred to as Pillar Two or the minimum tax directive. Many aspects of the minimum tax directive will be effective beginning in fiscal 2025, with certain remaining impacts to be effective beginning in fiscal 2026. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt the minimum tax directive, certain countries in which we operate have adopted legislation, and other countries are in the process of introducing legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. While we do not currently expect the minimum tax directive to have a material impact on our effective\ntax rate, our analysis is ongoing as the OECD continues to release additional guidance and countries implement legislation. To the extent additional changes take place in the countries in which we operate, it is possible that these legislative changes and efforts may increase uncertainty and have an adverse impact on our effective tax rates or operations.\nWe are subject to the continuous examination of our income and other tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities globally, and we have a number of such reviews underway at any time. It is possible that tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken, and an adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and operating results. There can be no assurance that the outcomes from such examinations, or changes in tax law or regulation impacting our effective tax rates, will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we include in our annual report a report containing managements assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year and a statement as to whether or not such internal controls are effective. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and is likely to continue to result in, significant costs and the commitment of time and operational resources. Certain ongoing initiatives, including efforts to transform business processes or to transition certain functions to third-party resources or providers, will necessitate modifications to our internal control systems, processes and related information systems as we optimize our business and operations. Our expansion into new regions could pose further challenges to our internal control systems. We cannot be certain that our current design for internal control over financial reporting, or any additional changes to be made, will be sufficient to enable management to determine that our internal controls are effective for any period, or on an ongoing basis. If we are unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, market perception of our financial condition and the trading price of our stock may be adversely affected, and customer perception of our business may suffer.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock, Indebtedness and Investments\nOur stock price is volatile.\nOur common stock price has experienced substantial volatility in the past and may remain volatile in the future. Volatility in our stock price can arise as a result of a number of the factors discussed in this Risk Factors section. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2023, our closing stock price ranged from a high of $77.60 per share to a low of $34.50 per share. The stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuation that has affected the market price of many technology companies, with such volatility often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Divergence between our actual results and our forward-looking guidance for such results, the published expectations of investment analysts, or the expectations of the market generally, can cause significant swings in our stock price. Our stock price can also be affected by market conditions in our industry as well as announcements that we, our competitors, vendors or our customers may make. These may include announcements by us or our competitors of financial results or changes in estimated financial results, technological innovations, the gain or loss of customers, or other strategic initiatives. Our common stock is also included in certain market indices, and any change in the composition of these indices to exclude our company could adversely affect our stock price. In addition, if the market for technology stocks or the broader stock market continues to experience a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. These and other factors affecting macroeconomic conditions or financial markets may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock in the future.\nOutstanding indebtedness under our senior secured credit facilities and senior unsecured notes may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations and could limit our business.\nWe are a party to credit agreements relating to a $300.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility, an outstanding senior secured term loan with approximately $1.2 billion due 2030, and an outstanding senior unsecured indenture pursuant to which we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2030. The agreements governing these credit facilities contain certain covenants that limit our ability, among other things, to incur additional debt, create liens and encumbrances, pay cash dividends, redeem or repurchase stock, enter into certain acquisition transactions or transactions with affiliates, repay certain indebtedness, make investments, or dispose of assets. The agreements also include customary remedies, including the right of the lenders to take action with respect to the collateral securing the loans, that would apply should we default or otherwise be unable to satisfy our debt obligations.\nOur indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing, particularly in unfavorable capital and credit market conditions;\ndebt service and repayment obligations that may adversely impact our results of operations and reduce the availability of cash resources for other business purposes;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the markets; and\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to competitors that have better access to capital resources.\nWe may also enter into additional debt transactions or credit facilities, including equipment loans, working capital lines of credit, senior notes, and other long-term debt, which may increase our indebtedness and result in additional restrictions on our business. In addition, major debt rating agencies regularly evaluate our debt based on a number of factors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing debt ratings, and failure to do so could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nSignificant volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets may limit our access to funding on favorable terms or at all.\nThe operation of our business requires significant capital. We have accessed the capital markets in the past and have successfully raised funds, including through the issuance of equity, convertible notes and other indebtedness, to increase our cash position, support our operations and undertake strategic growth initiatives. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations and anticipated cash needs to fund our long-term operating plans, and we may consider it necessary or advisable to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness in the future. If we raise additional funds through further issuance of equity or securities convertible into equity, or undertake certain transactions intended to address our existing indebtedness, our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company, or our leverage and outstanding indebtedness could increase. Current capital market conditions, including the impact of inflation, have increased borrowing rates and can be expected to significantly increase our cost of capital as compared to prior periods should we seek additional funding. Moreover, global capital markets have undergone periods of significant volatility and uncertainty in the past, and there can be no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available to us on favorable terms or at all, should we determine it necessary or advisable to seek additional capital. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable. Item 2. Properties\nOverview. As of October 28, 2023, all of our properties are leased, and we do not own any real property.

Our solutions include Networking Platforms, including our Optical Networking and Routing and Switching portfolios, which can be applied from the network core to end-user access points, and which allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic efficiently and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. To complement our Networking Platforms, we offer Platform Software, which includes our Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) applications that deliver advanced multi-layer domain control and operations. Through our Blue Planet Software, we also enable complete service lifecycle management automation with productized operational support systems (OSS), which include inventory, orchestration and assurance solutions that help our customers to achieve closed loop automation across multi-vendor and multi-domain environments.\nOrder Volumes\nFrom the second quarter of fiscal 2021 through the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we received an unprecedented volume of orders for our products and services. Our quarterly order volumes during this period significantly exceeded our revenue and historical order volumes, with concentration of orders among certain existing cloud provider and North America-based service provider customers. We believe some portion of these orders reflected customer acceleration of future orders due to lengthened lead times or the implementation of security of supply strategies to address the supply constraints described below. We also believe some portion of these orders reflected pre-pandemic design wins for which orders were delayed due to the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our order volumes began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We continued to experience levels of orders lower than revenue during fiscal 2023, with order volumes slightly increasing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We believe this reduction in orders relative to revenue has been in part due to customers no longer needing to place significant advanced orders, because supply chain conditions and lead times have improved. However, over the longer term, we continue to believe that certain trends and shifts in business and consumer behaviors, including enterprise and consumer cloud network adoption, 5G, high-definition video, generative AI, and network operator focus on resilience and automation, represent positive, long-term drivers of demand and opportunities for our business.\nBacklog and Order Delivery Timing\nHistorically, a meaningful portion of our quarterly revenue was generated from customer orders received during that same quarter (which we refer to as book to revenue) and was therefore less predictable and subject to fluctuation. As a result of elevated order volumes during portions of fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022, and the supply chain constraints described below, however, we generated a significant backlog of customer orders. Accordingly, our revenue has been more recently impacted by factors including availability of supply and customer delivery deferrals of existing backlog. Our backlog grew from $1.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2020 to $4.2 billion at the end of fiscal 2022. As supply chain conditions have improved and we have been able to increase shipment volumes and reduce lead times, our backlog decreased to $2.6 billion as of the end of fiscal 2023. We expect our backlog to continue to reduce during fiscal 2024 as supply chain conditions continue to improve and customers place fewer advanced orders. As that happens, we expect that our reliance upon securing quarterly book to revenue orders will grow and that those orders will represent a more typical composition of our quarterly revenue and to be a critical element of future revenue growth.\nThe timing with which, and degree to which, we fulfill our backlog will have a significant impact on our rate of revenue growth and can be affected by factors outside of our control, including supply chain conditions and availability of components described below, and customer readiness and willingness to receive shipment against existing orders. During fiscal 2023, certain customers, including communications service providers and cable and multiservice operators in North America and cloud providers, that had earlier placed significant advanced orders, rescheduled deliveries for a portion of such orders,\nincluding in some cases until after the end of fiscal 2023. We believe that this was the result of a number of factors, including these customers significant order levels during a period of supply chain constraints, the recent, rapid improvement in our delivery lead times, and their capital expenditure and inventory levels. Accordingly, our results for a particular period can be difficult to predict. As a result of these and other factors, the timing of our fulfillment of backlog could cause some volatility in our results of operations and our backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of revenue for any particular period. See the risk factors captioned Our backlog may not be an accurate indicator of our level and timing of future revenues. and Our revenue, gross margin, and operating results can fluctuate significantly and unpredictably from quarter to quarter. in Item 1A of Part I of this report for further discussion of risks related to our backlog and order delivery timing.\nSupply Chain Constraints\nIn the face of demand across a range of industries, global supply for certain raw materials and components, including, in particular, semiconductor, integrated circuits, and other electronic components used in most of our products, experienced substantial constraint and disruption in recent prior periods. As a result, we experienced significant component shortages, extended lead times, increased costs, and unexpected cancellation or delay of previously committed supply of key components across our supplier base. During the second half of fiscal 2023, lead times, costs, and predictability of supply for semiconductors, integrated circuits, and other electronic components began to stabilize and the majority of our suppliers have been able to deliver by their promised, though extended, lead times. However, we expect that extended lead times for components and elevated component costs will persist at least through the first half of fiscal 2024. Supply constrained conditions have impacted our revenue and will continue to impact our costs of goods sold in the near term and our ability to continue to reduce the cost to produce our products in a manner consistent with prior periods. It is unclear when the supply environment will fully stabilize and what impacts it will have on our business and results of operations in future periods.\nTo mitigate the impact of these supply conditions on our business and customers, we have placed and continue to place advanced orders for inventory and have been accumulating components. We also expanded our manufacturing capacity to prepare us to be able to produce finished goods more quickly. As a result of this strategy, our inventory increased from $374.3 million at the end of fiscal 2021 to $1.1 billion at the end of fiscal 2023. Together with increased costs of supply, these mitigation strategies have impacted, and we expect them to continue to impact, our result of operations and cash from operations.\nMarket Opportunity\nThe market in which we sell our communications networking solutions is dynamic and characterized by a high rate of change, including rapid growth in bandwidth demand and network traffic, the proliferation of cloud-based services and new approaches, or consumption models, for designing and procuring networking solutions. Emerging services and applications, including 5G mobile communications, fiber-based access networks and the Internet of Things, are further impacting or expected to impact wireline network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased capacity, computing power and automation are required to provide the quality of experience demanded by end users. Many network operators are under pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets, as they cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. To address these growing service demands and manage network cost, many network operators are looking to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are more programmable and better capable of leveraging data for network insight, analytics and automation. Other network operators are pursuing a diverse range of consumption models in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. Our Adaptive Network vision and our business strategy to capitalize on these changing market dynamics include the initiatives set forth in the Strategy section of the description of our business in Item 1 of Part I of this annual report.\nStrategic and Financial Initiatives\nAcquisitions. On November 17, 2022, we acquired Benu Networks, Inc. (Benu) and its portfolio of cloud-native software solutions, including a virtual Broadband Network Gateway ((v)BNG), which complement our existing portfolio of broadband access solutions. On December 30, 2022, we acquired Tibit Communications, Inc. (Tibit), a provider of passive optical network solutions. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for more information on these acquisitions.\nCredit Facility Refinancings. On October 24, 2023, we entered into an Incremental Amendment Agreement to our existing Credit Agreement, dated July 15, 2014, as amended (the Credit Agreement), pursuant to which we incurred a new single tranche of senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $1.2 billion, maturing on October 24, 2030 (the 2030 New Term Loan). The proceeds of the 2030 New Term Loan, together with cash on hand, were used to repay in full (i) our existing senior secured term loan with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of approximately $668.7 million and\nmaturing on September 28, 2025 (the 2025 Term Loan), and (ii) our existing senior secured term loan with an outstanding aggregate principal amount of approximately $497.5 million and maturing on January 19, 2030 (the 2030 Term Loan), including accrued interest, and pay transaction fees and expenses. See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for more information on our term loans.\nOn October 24, 2023, pursuant to the above Incremental Amendment Agreement to the Credit Agreement, we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit facility of $300 million (the Revolving Credit Facility), maturing on October 24, 2028, which replaces a predecessor senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility of up to $300 million, maturing on September 25, 2025 (the ABL Credit Facility) under our ABL Credit Agreement, dated October 28, 2019, as amended (the ABL Credit Agreement). Concurrent with entering into the Revolving Credit Facility, the ABL Credit Agreement was terminated. We intend to use the Revolving Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and for general corporate purposes. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for more information on our revolving credit facilities.\nFiscal Year-End Backlog\nGenerally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Generally, our customers may cancel, delay or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance are rare. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.\nOur backlog was $2.6 billion as of October 28, 2023, as compared to $4.2 billion as of October 29, 2022. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined, and our significant annual growth reflects the demand dynamics described above. Backlog at October 28, 2023 includes approximately $336.2 million primarily related to orders for products and maintenance and support services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2024. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nA discussion regarding our financial condition and results of operations for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 is presented below. A discussion of fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022, filed with the SEC on December 16, 2022, which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at investor.ciena.com.\nOperating Segments\nOur results of operations are presented based on the following operating segments: (i) Networking Platforms; (ii) Platform Software and Services; (iii) Blue Planet Automation Software and Services; and (iv) Global Services. Effective the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we renamed our Converged Packet Optical product line Optical Networking. This change was made on a prospective basis and does not impact comparability of previous financial results or the composition of this product line. However, references to our Converged Packet Optical product line in prior periods have been changed to Optical Networking in this report. See Notes 2 and 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information on our segment reporting.\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nRevenue\nCurrency Fluctuations\nDuring fiscal 2023, approximately 14.9% of our revenue was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, primarily including sales in Euros, Canadian Dollars and British Pounds. During fiscal 2023, as compared to fiscal 2022, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against these and other currencies. Consequently, our revenue reported in U.S. Dollars was adversely impacted by approximately $4.7 million, or 0.1%, as compared to fiscal 2022.\nOperating Segment Revenue\nSee Notes 2 and 25 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report for more information on our segment reporting. The table below sets forth the changes in our operating segment revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase (decrease) %**\nRevenue:\nNetworking Platforms\nOptical Networking $ 2,987,245 68.1 $ 2,379,931 65.5 $ 607,314 25.5\nRouting and Switching 506,247 11.5 398,439 11.0 107,808 27.1\nTotal Networking Platforms 3,493,492 79.6 2,778,370 76.5 715,122 25.7\nPlatform Software and Services 303,873 6.9 277,191 7.6 26,682 9.6\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services\n69,170 1.6 76,567 2.1 (7,397) (9.7)\nGlobal Services\nMaintenance Support and Training 288,334 6.6 292,375 8.1 (4,041) (1.4)\nInstallation and Deployment 180,951 4.1 157,443 4.3 23,508 14.9\nConsulting and Network Design 50,729 1.2 50,715 1.4 14 -\nTotal Global Services 520,014 11.9 500,533 13.8 19,481 3.9\nConsolidated revenue $ 4,386,549 100.0 $ 3,632,661 100.0 $ 753,888 20.8\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of total revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nNetworking Platforms segment revenue increased by $715.1 million, reflecting product line sales increases of $607.3 million of our Optical Networking products and $107.8 million of our Routing and Switching products.\n\u25e6Optical Networking sales increased, primarily reflecting sales increases of $374.3 million of our 6500 RLS products, primarily to cloud providers, and $131.3 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, primarily to communications service providers and enterprise customers, and a sales increase of $101.9 million of our Waveserver\u00ae modular interconnect system, primarily to cloud providers.\n\u25e6Routing and Switching sales increased, primarily reflecting a sales increase of $81.1 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches, including initial sales of our microplug OLT transceivers that are integrated in our aggregation switches or sold on a stand-alone basis, primarily to communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators and enterprise customers. Routing and Switching sales also includes an increase of $25.3 million of our 8100 Coherent IP networking platforms to communications service providers.\nPlatform Software and Services segment revenue increased by $26.7 million, reflecting a sales increase of $45.8 million in software maintenance services, offset by a decrease of $19.1 million in sales of software platforms. The increase in our software maintenance services was primarily for our MCP software platform, sold to communications service providers. The decrease in software sales was primarily from decreased sales of our MCP software platform to communication service providers.\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services segment revenue decreased by $7.4 million, reflecting deceases of $3.8 million in software platform sales, primarily to cable and multiservice operators, and $3.6 million in professional software services, primarily to communication service providers.\nGlobal Services segment revenue increased by $19.5 million, primarily reflecting a sales increase of $23.5 million of our installation and deployment service, partially offset by a decrease of $4.0 million of our maintenance support and training. Improved reliability of the previously constrained supply environment has benefited installation and deployment services, as described in more detail in Overview above.\nRevenue by Geographic Region\nOur operating segments engage in business and operations across three geographic regions: the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (Americas); Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and Asia Pacific, Japan and India (APAC). The geographic distribution of our revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period, and the timing of revenue recognition for large network projects, particularly outside of the United States, can result in large variations in geographic revenue results in any particular period. The increase in our Americas region revenue for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by increased sales in the United States. The increase in our APAC region revenue for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by increased sales in India, Australia and Singapore. The increase in our EMEA region revenue for fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by increased sales in the Netherlands. The following table reflects our geographic distribution of revenue, which is principally based on the relevant location for the delivery of our products and performance of services. The table below sets forth the changes in geographic distribution of revenue for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nAmericas $ 3,110,347 70.9 $ 2,636,840 72.6 $ 473,507 18.0\nEMEA 643,142 14.7 555,215 15.3 87,927 15.8\nAPAC 633,060 14.4 440,606 12.1 192,454 43.7\nTotal $ 4,386,549 100.0 $ 3,632,661 100.0 $ 753,888 20.8\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of total revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nAmericas revenue increased by $473.5 million, reflecting sales increases of $460.4 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $17.2 million within our Platform Software and Services segment and $5.1 million within our Global Services segment, partially offset by a sales decrease of $9.2 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment. Our Networking Platforms segment revenue increase reflects product line sales increases of $395.2 million of our Optical Networking products and $65.2 million of our Routing and Switching products. The increase within our Optical Networking revenue primarily reflects sales increases of $286.4 million of our 6500 RLS products and $75.9 million of our Waveserver\u00ae modular interconnect system, both primarily to cloud providers, and $35.7 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, primarily to communication service providers and enterprise customers, partially offset by decreased sales to cable and multiservice operators. The increase within our Routing and Switching product line primarily reflects sales increases of $40.3 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches, primarily to cable and multiservice operators and enterprise customers, and $21.4 million of our 8100 Coherent IP networking platforms, primarily to communications service providers.\nEMEA revenue increased by $87.9 million, reflecting sales increases of $68.0 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $9.2 million within our Global Services segment, $6.4 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment and $4.3 million within our Platform Software and Services segment. Our Networking Platforms segment revenue increase primarily reflects product line sales increases of $35.1 million of our Optical Networking products and $32.9 million of our Routing and Switching products. The increase within our Optical Networking revenue primarily reflects a sales increase of $62.0 million of our 6500 RLS products, primarily to cloud providers, partially offset by sales decreases of $15.0 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform and $12.3 million of our Waveserver\u00ae modular interconnect system, both primarily to cloud providers. The increase within our Routing and Switching revenue primarily reflects a sales increase of $27.0 million of our 3000 and 5000 families of service delivery and aggregation switches, primarily to communication service providers.\nAPAC revenue increased by $192.5 million, reflecting sales increases of $186.7 million within our Networking Platforms segment, $5.2 million within our Platform Software and Services segment, and $5.1 million of our Global Services segment, partially offset by a sales decrease of $4.5 million within our Blue Planet Automation Software and\nServices segment. Our Networking Platforms segment revenue increase reflects a product line sales increase of $177.0 million of our Optical Networking products, primarily reflecting a sales increase of $110.6 million of our 6500 Packet-Optical Platform, primarily to communication service providers and enterprise customers\nIn fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, our top ten customers contributed 53.7% and 56.3% of our revenue, respectively. Consequently, our financial results are closely correlated with the spending of a relatively small number of customers and can be significantly affected by market, industry or competitive dynamics affecting the businesses of those customers. Our reliance on a relatively small number of customers increases our exposure to changes in their spending levels, network priorities and purchasing strategies. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly depending on sales volumes and purchasing priorities with these large customers. Sales to one of our cloud provider customers were $561.4 million, or 12.8% of total revenue, in fiscal 2023. Sales to AT&T were $464.7 million, or 10.6% of total revenue, in fiscal 2023, and $433.4 million, or 11.9% of total revenue, in fiscal 2022. Verizon accounted for $402.8 million, or 11.1% of total revenue, in fiscal 2022. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue in fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.\nWhile drivers of bandwidth growth and network evolution remain strong, many of our network operator customers are under pressure to constrain their capital expenditure budgets, and their businesses cannot grow their network spending at the rate of bandwidth growth. As a result, as we innovate and introduce new and more robust solutions that increase capacity or add features, there is a market expectation for solutions that are more cost-effective than existing or competing solutions and that new products consistently deliver lower price per bit performance. The combination of this regular technology-driven price compression, price competition in our markets and ongoing customer efforts to manage network costs can impact our growth rates and requires that we increase our volume of product shipments to maintain and grow revenue.\nCost of Goods Sold and Gross Profit\nProduct cost of goods sold consists primarily of amounts paid to third-party contract manufacturers, component costs, employee-related costs and overhead, shipping and logistics costs associated with manufacturing-related operations, warranty and other contractual obligations, royalties, license fees, amortization of intangible assets, cost of excess and obsolete inventory and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts.\nServices cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct and third-party costs associated with our provision of services including installation, deployment, maintenance support, consulting and training activities, and, when applicable, estimated losses on committed customer contracts. The majority of these costs relate to personnel, including employee and third-party contractor-related costs.\nOur gross profit as a percentage of revenue, or gross margin, can fluctuate due to a number of factors, particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis. Our gross margin can fluctuate and be adversely impacted depending on our revenue concentration within a particular segment, product line, geography, or customer, including our success in selling software in a particular period. Our gross margin remains highly dependent on our continued ability to drive annual product cost reductions relative to the price erosion that we regularly encounter in our markets. This can be challenging, particularly within the current constrained supply environment. Moreover, we are often required to compete with aggressive pricing and commercial terms, and, to secure business with new and existing customers, we may agree to pricing or other unfavorable commercial terms that adversely affect our gross margin. Success in taking share and winning new business can result in additional pressure on gross margin from these pricing dynamics and the early stages of these network deployments. Early stages of new network builds also often include an increased concentration of lower margin common equipment, photonics sales and installation services, with the intent to improve margin as we sell channel cards and maintenance services to customers as they add capacity and need to monitor their networks. Gross margin can be impacted by technology-based price compression and the introduction or substitution of new platforms with improved price for performance as compared to existing solutions that carry higher margins. Gross margin can also be impacted by changes in expense for excess and obsolete inventory and warranty obligations.\nService gross margin can be affected by the mix of customers and services, particularly the mix between deployment and maintenance services, geographic mix and the timing and extent of any investments in internal resources to support this business.\nThe tables below set forth the changes in revenue, cost of goods sold and gross profit for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nTotal revenue $ 4,386,549 100.0 $ 3,632,661 100.0 $ 753,888 20.8\nTotal cost of goods sold 2,507,698 57.2 2,072,317 57.0 435,381 21.0\nGross profit $ 1,878,851 42.8 $ 1,560,344 43.0 $ 318,507 20.4\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of total revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nProduct revenue $ 3,581,039 100.0 $ 2,888,848 100.0 $ 692,191 24.0\nProduct cost of goods sold 2,088,440 58.3 1,699,631 58.8 388,809 22.9\nProduct gross profit $ 1,492,599 41.7 $ 1,189,217 41.2 $ 303,382 25.5\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of product revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nServices revenue $ 805,510 100.0 $ 743,813 100.0 $ 61,697 8.3\nServices cost of goods sold 419,258 52.0 372,686 50.1 46,572 12.5\nServices gross profit $ 386,252 48.0 $ 371,127 49.9 $ 15,125 4.1\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of service revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nGross profit increased by $318.5 million. Gross margin decreased by 20 basis points, primarily due to lower margin on services partially offset by improved margin on products.\nGross profit on products increased by $303.4 million. Product gross margin increased by 50 basis points, primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower product costs, partially offset by a higher concentration of lower margin common equipment and photonics sales, as described above.\nGross profit on services increased by $15.1 million. Service gross margin decreased by 190 basis points, primarily due to higher incremental costs on maintenance related support and losses incurred on certain Blue Planet software service projects and lower margin on certain consulting projects. These decreases were partially offset by increased Platform Software services revenue.\nOperating Expense\nCurrency Fluctuations\nDuring fiscal 2023, approximately 49.4% of our operating expense was non-U.S. Dollar denominated, including Canadian Dollars, Indian Rupees, and Euros. During fiscal 2023 as compared to fiscal 2022, the U.S. Dollar primarily strengthened against these and other currencies. Consequently, our operating expense reported in U.S. Dollars decreased by approximately $23.3 million, or 1.5%, net of hedging.\nOperating expense increased in fiscal 2023 from the level reported for fiscal 2022, primarily due to increases in employee headcount and variable compensation costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan and increases in professional services. We have also experienced, and are continuing to experience, increases in the cost of labor and other costs of doing business due to inflation, and continued inflationary pressures could have an adverse impact on our profitability. We\nexpect operating expense to continue to increase from the level reported in fiscal 2023 primarily due to planned investment in research and development to advance our strategy and higher employee compensation costs.\nOperating expense consists of the component elements described below.\nResearch and development expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense), prototype costs relating to design, development, product testing, depreciation expense, and third-party consulting costs.\nSelling and marketing expense primarily consists of salaries, commissions and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and sales and marketing support expense, including travel, demonstration units, trade show expense, and third-party consulting costs.\nGeneral and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and related employee expense (including share-based compensation expense) and costs for third-party consulting and other services.\nSignificant asset impairments and restructuring costs primarily reflect actions we have taken to improve the alignment of our workforce, facilities and operating costs with perceived market opportunities, business strategies, changes in market and business conditions, the redesign of certain business processes and significant impairments of assets.\nAmortization of intangible assets primarily reflects the amortization of both purchased technology and the value of customer relationships derived from our acquisitions.\nAcquisition and integration costs primarily consist of expenses for financial, legal and accounting advisors and severance and other employee-related costs, associated with our acquisition activity. For more information on our acquisitions, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nThe table below sets forth the changes in operating expense for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nResearch and development $ 750,559 17.1 $ 624,656 17.2 $ 125,903 20.2\nSelling and marketing 490,804 11.2 466,565 12.9 24,239 5.2\nGeneral and administrative 215,284 4.9 179,382 4.9 35,902 20.0\nSignificant asset impairments and restructuring costs 23,834 0.5 33,824 0.9 (9,990) (29.5)\nAmortization of intangible assets 37,351 0.9 32,511 0.9 4,840 14.9\nAcquisition and integration costs 3,474 0.1 598 - 2,876 480.9\nTotal operating expenses $ 1,521,306 34.7 $ 1,337,536 36.8 $ 183,770 13.7\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of total revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nResearch and development expense benefited from $16.3 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, net of hedging, primarily due to a stronger U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar and Indian Rupee. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, net of hedging, research and development expenses increased by $125.9 million. This increase primarily reflects increases in employee headcount and related compensation costs including variable compensation costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan, and professional services related to design engineering, fabrication and production of ASIC chips. The increase in employee headcount was partially due to our acquisitions of Benu and Tibit.\nSelling and marketing expense benefited from $5.4 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, primarily due to a stronger U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar and the Euro. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, sales and marketing expense increased by $24.2 million. This increase primarily reflects increases in travel and entertainment costs, professional services and employee-related compensation costs primarily related to higher costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan.\nGeneral and administrative expense benefited from $1.6 million as a result of foreign exchange rates, primarily due to a stronger U.S. Dollar in relation to the Canadian Dollar and Indian Rupee. Including the effect of foreign exchange rates, general and administrative expense increased by $35.9 million. This increase primarily reflects increases in employee-related compensation costs primarily related to higher costs associated with our annual cash incentive compensation plan, costs incurred as a result of the settlement of certain patent infringement claims and the resolution of related legal proceedings, and professional services.\nSignificant asset impairments and restructuring costs decreased by $10.0 million. This decrease primarily reflects the effect of a $3.8 million impairment charge due to our suspended operations in Russia recorded in fiscal 2022 and lower costs on actions that we have taken with respect to our operations, global workforce, and facilities as part of a business optimization strategy to improve gross margin, constrain operating expense, redesign certain business processes, and restructure real estate facilities.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased by $4.8 million reflecting additional intangibles acquired in connection with our acquisitions of Benu and Tibit during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, partially offset by certain intangible assets having reached the end of their economic lives.\nAcquisition and integration costs increased by $2.9 million and primarily reflect financial, legal, and accounting advisors and employee-related costs related to our acquisitions of Benu and Tibit.\nOther Items\nThe table below sets forth the changes in other items for the periods indicated (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 %* 2022 %* Increase\n(decrease) %**\nInterest and other income (loss), net $ 62,008 1.4 $ 6,747 0.2 $ 55,261 819.0\nInterest expense $ (88,026) (2.0) $ (47,050) (1.3) $ 40,976 87.1\nLoss on extinguishment and modification of debt $ (7,874) (0.2) $ - - $ 7,874 100.0\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes $ 68,826 1.6 $ 29,603 0.8 $ 39,223 132.5\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % of total revenue\n** Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nInterest and other income (loss), net increased by $55.3 million, primarily resulting from higher interest income on our investments and the remeasurement of our previously held investment in Tibit to fair value, which resulted in a gain on our cost method equity investment of $26.5 million. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net of foreign currency hedging impact. For more information on our acquisition of Tibit, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nInterest expense increased, primarily due to additional indebtedness, including the 2030 Term Loan entered into during the first quarter of fiscal 2023, and increased interest on the unhedged portion of the 2025 Term Loan, 2030 Term Loan and 2030 New Term Loan (as defined below), primarily due to higher interest rates. For more information on our short-term and long-term debt, see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nLoss on extinguishment and modification of debt primarily reflects $1.9 million of extinguishment of debt costs and $6.0 million in debt modification costs, both related to our term loan refinancing which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. For more information, see Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this annual report.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes increased by $39.2 million, primarily due to the increase in pre-tax income in fiscal 2023. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2022, primarily due to the mandatory capitalization of research and development expenses in fiscal 2023.\nSegment Profit (Loss)\nThe table below sets forth the changes in our segment profit (loss) for the respective periods (in thousands, except percentage data):\nFiscal Year\n2023 2022 Increase\n(decrease) %*\nSegment profit (loss):\nNetworking Platforms $ 778,641 $ 572,305 $ 206,336 36.1\nPlatform Software and Services $ 186,945 $ 175,108 $ 11,837 6.8\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services $ (33,669) $ (22,388) $ (11,281) (50.4)\nGlobal Services $ 196,375 $ 210,663 $ (14,288) (6.8)\n_________________________________\n* Denotes % change from 2022 to 2023\nNetworking Platforms segment profit increased by $206.3 million, primarily due to higher sales volume as described above, and higher gross margin, partially offset by increased research and development costs.\nPlatform Software and Services segment profit increased by $11.8 million, primarily due to higher software-related services sales volume as described above, partially offset by lower software sales volume, increased research and development costs, and lower gross margin on software-related services.\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services segment loss increased by $11.3 million, primarily due to lower sales volume, increased research and development costs and lower gross margin on software-related services, as described above.\nGlobal Services segment profit decreased by $14.3 million, primarily due to higher incremental costs on maintenance related support and lower maintenance support and training revenue, as described above.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview. For the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023, we generated $168.3 million of cash from operations, as our net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) of $565.1 million exceeded our working capital requirements of $396.8 million. For additional details on our cash used in operating activities, see the discussion below under the caption Cash Provided by Operating Activities.\nCash, cash equivalents and investments increased by $65.9 million during fiscal 2023. Cash from operations was partially offset by the following: (i) cash used for stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program of $242.2 million; (ii) cash used for the acquisition of businesses of $230.0 million, net of cash acquired; (iii) cash used to fund our investing activities for capital expenditures totaling $106.2 million; (iv) stock repurchased upon vesting of our stock unit awards to employees relating to tax withholding of $38.5 million; and (v) cash used for payments on our term loans of $9.4 million. In addition to cash provided by operations, the following items also contributed to the increase in cash: (i) proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Term Loan, which provided $492.5 million in cash, net of paid debt issuance costs; and (ii) issuance of equity under our employee stock purchase plans which provided $31.4 million in cash during fiscal 2023.\nSee Notes 4, 19, and 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report for information relating to these transactions.\nThe following table sets forth changes in our cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 Increase (decrease)\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,010,618 $ 994,352 $ 16,266\nShort-term investments in marketable debt securities 104,753 153,989 (49,236)\nLong-term investments in marketable debt securities 134,278 35,385 98,893\nTotal cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities $ 1,249,649 $ 1,183,726 $ 65,923\nPrincipal Sources of Liquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity include our cash, cash equivalents and investments, which as of October 28, 2023 totaled $1.2 billion, as well as the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility, which we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into on October 24, 2023, replaced the ABL Credit Facility and provides for a total commitment of $300.0 million with a maturity date of October 24, 2028. We principally use the Revolving Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of our business and for general\ncorporate purposes. As of October 28, 2023, letters of credit totaling $72.5 million were outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of October 28, 2023.\nForeign Liquidity. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries was $308.0 million as of October 28, 2023. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we evaluated the undistributed earnings of the foreign subsidiaries and identified approximately $222.0 million in earnings that we no longer consider to be indefinitely reinvested. We have recorded a provision of $2.5 million that reflects the income tax effects of the repatriation of these earnings. No additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in our foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested. See Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nStock Repurchase Authorization. On December 9, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of our common stock, which replaced in its entirety the previous stock repurchase program authorized in fiscal 2019. During fiscal 2023, we repurchased an additional $250.0 million of our common stock under the stock repurchase program, and we had $250.0 million remaining under the current repurchase authorization as of October 28, 2023. The amount and timing of any further repurchases under our stock repurchase program are subject to a variety of factors including liquidity, cash flow, stock price and general business and market conditions. The program may be modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. See Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nLiquidity Position. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that cash from operations, cash, cash equivalents, investments, and other sources of liquidity, including our Revolving Credit Facility, will satisfy our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through the next 12 months and the reasonably foreseeable future. We regularly evaluate our liquidity position, debt obligations, and anticipated cash needs to fund our operating or investment plans, and will continue to consider capital raising and other market opportunities that may be available to us. We have historically been successful in our ability to secure such sources of financing; however, our access to these sources of capital could be materially and adversely impacted, and we may not be able to receive terms as favorable as we have historically received, whether due to inflation or other factors. We regularly evaluate alternatives to manage our capital structure and market opportunities to enhance our liquidity and provide further operational and strategic flexibility.\nCash Provided by Operating Activities\nThe following sections set forth the components of our $168.3 million of cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023:\nNet Income (adjusted for non-cash charges)\nThe following table sets forth our net income (adjusted for non-cash charges) during fiscal 2023 (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023\nNet income $ 254,827\nAdjustments for non-cash charges:\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 1,864\nDepreciation of equipment, building, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of leasehold improvements 92,564\nShare-based compensation costs 130,455\nAmortization of intangible assets 49,616\nDeferred taxes (14,852)\nProvision for inventory excess and obsolescence 29,464\nProvision for warranty 31,742\nGain on cost method equity investments, net (26,368)\nOther 15,771\nNet income (adjusted for non-cash charges) $ 565,083\nWorking Capital\nWe used $396.8 million of cash for working capital during fiscal 2023.

For more details, see Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report.\nOur days sales outstanding (DSOs) were 95 for fiscal 2023, as compared to 107 for fiscal 2022. The calculation of DSOs includes accounts receivable, net and contract assets for unbilled receivables, net included in prepaid expenses and other. Our inventory turns slightly increased from 1.8 during fiscal 2022 to 2.0 during fiscal 2023 due to the supply chain beginning to stabilize as described above.\nCash Paid for Interest, Net\nThe following table sets forth the cash paid for interest, net during fiscal 2023 (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023\n2025 Term Loan due September 28, 2025(1)\n$ 43,961\n2030 Term Loan due January 19, 2030(2)\n28,364\n2030 New Term Loan due October 28, 2030(3)\n-\n2030 Senior Notes due January 31, 2030(4)\n16,000\nInterest rate swaps(5)\n(10,035)\nRevolving Credit Facilities(6)\n2,097\nFinance leases 4,078\nCash paid during period $ 84,465\n(1) The 2025 Term Loan bore interest at LIBOR for the chosen borrowing period plus a spread of 1.75% subject to a minimum LIBOR rate of 0.00% prior to its amendment on January 19, 2023, and then bore interest at SOFR for the chosen borrowing period plus a spread of 1.75% subject to a minimum SOFR rate of 0.00%.

The 2030 Term Loan was terminated on October 24, 2023.\n(3) Interest on the 2030 New Term Loan is payable periodically based on the interest period selected for borrowing. The 2030 New Term Loan bears interest at SOFR for the chosen borrowing period plus a spread of 2.00% subject to a minimum SOFR rate of 0.00%. At the end of fiscal 2023, the interest rate on the 2030 New Term Loan was 7.33%.\n(4) The 2030 Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.00% per annum and mature on January 31, 2030. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semiannually on January 31 and July 31 of each year.\n(5) Our interest rate swaps fix the SOFR rate for $350.0 million of our Term Loans at 3.47% through January 2028 and another $350.0 million of our Term Loans at 2.968% through September 2025. In January 2023, we entered into a LIBOR to SOFR basis swap (basis swap). The basis swap and our LIBOR interest rate swaps, which matured in September 2023, fixed the SOFR rate for $350.0 million of our Term Loans at 2.883% from January to September 2023.\n(6) During fiscal 2023, we issued certain standby letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility and its predecessor, the ABL Credit Facility and paid $2.1 million in commitment fees, interest expense and other administrative charges primarily relating to the ABL Credit Facility.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 28, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nReserve for Excess and Obsolete Inventory\nAs described in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys consolidated inventory balance, net of the allowance for excess and obsolescence, was $1.1 billion as of October 28, 2023. Management records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when an impairment has been identified and has a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory of $50.0 million as of October 28, 2023. Management writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand, which are affected by changes in the Companys strategic direction, discontinuance of a product or introduction of newer versions of products, declines in the sales of or forecasted demand for certain products, and general market conditions.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort to perform procedures and evaluate the audit evidence obtained relating to the assumptions regarding future demand.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Companys evaluation of the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory, including controls over the assumptions used within the model. These procedures also included, among others, testing managements process for determining the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. This included evaluating the appropriateness of the inventory reserve model and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions relating to the future demand. Evaluating the assumptions related to future demand involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering historical sales and expectations regarding future sales. Testing management's process for determining future demand included procedures to evaluate the reliability, completeness and relevance of management's data used in the future demand assumption. Testing the relevance and reliability of the data included evaluating the reasonableness of the long-term sales forecasts and historical activity.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBaltimore, Maryland\nDecember 15, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1992.\nCIENA CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in thousands, except share data)\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,010,618 $ 994,352\nShort-term investments 104,753 153,989\nAccounts receivable, net 1,003,876 920,772\nInventories, net 1,050,838 946,730\nPrepaid expenses and other 405,694 370,053\nTotal current assets 3,575,779 3,385,896\nLong-term investments 134,278 35,385\nEquipment, building, furniture and fixtures, net 280,147 267,779\nOperating right-of-use assets 35,140 45,108\nGoodwill 444,765 328,322\nOther intangible assets, net 205,627 69,517\nDeferred tax asset, net 809,306 824,008\nOther long-term assets 116,453 113,617\nTotal assets $ 5,601,495 $ 5,069,632\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 317,828 $ 516,047\nAccrued liabilities and other short-term obligations 431,419 360,782\nDeferred revenue 154,419 137,899\nOperating lease liabilities 16,655 18,925\nCurrent portion of long-term debt 11,700 6,930\nTotal current liabilities 932,021 1,040,583\nLong-term deferred revenue 74,041 62,336\nOther long-term obligations 170,407 150,335\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 33,259 42,392\nLong-term debt, net 1,543,406 1,061,125\nTotal liabilities 2,753,134 2,356,771\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 27)\nStockholders equity:\nPreferred stock -

Ciena provides hardware, software and services that support the delivery of video, data and voice traffic over core, metro, aggregation and access communications networks. Cienas solutions are used globally by communications service providers, cable and multiservice operators, cloud providers, submarine network operators, governments, and enterprises across multiple industry verticals.\nCienas portfolio is designed to enable the Adaptive Network\u2122, Cienas vision for a network end state that leverages a programmable and scalable network infrastructure, driven by software control and automation capabilities, that is informed by network analytics and intelligence. By transforming network infrastructures into dynamic, programmable environments driven by automation and analytics, network operators can realize greater business agility, adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands and rapidly introduce new revenue-generating services. They can also gain valuable real-time network insights, allowing them to optimize network performance and maximize the return on their network infrastructure investment.\nCienas solutions include Networking Platforms, including its Optical Networking portfolio and Routing and Switching portfolio, which can be applied from the network core to end-user access points, and which allow network operators to scale capacity, increase transmission speeds, allocate traffic efficiently and adapt dynamically to changing end-user service demands. Cienas Optical Networking portfolio, which was previously referred to as Cienas Converged Packet Optical portfolio, includes products that support long haul and regional networks, submarine and data center interconnect networks, and metro and edge networks. Cienas Routing and Switching portfolio includes products and solutions that enable efficient internet protocol (IP) transport in next-generation metro, core, aggregation, and access networks, including in enterprise edge and broadband access applications.\nTo complement its Networking Platforms, Ciena offers Platform Software, which includes its Manage, Control and Plan (MCP) applications that deliver advanced multi-layer domain control and operations. Ciena, through its Blue Planet\u00ae Software, also enables complete service lifecycle management automation with productized operational support systems (OSS), which include inventory, orchestration and assurance solutions that help its customers to achieve closed loop automation across multi-vendor and multi-domain environments.\nIn addition to its systems and software, Ciena also offers a broad range of services that help its customers build, operate and improve their networks and associated operational environments. These include network transformation, consulting, implementation, systems integration, maintenance, network operations center (NOC) management, learning, and optimization services.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Ciena and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCiena has a 52 or 53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearest to the last day of October in each year (October 28, 2023, October 29, 2022, and October 30, 2021, for the periods reported). Fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 each consisted of a 52-week fiscal year.\nBusiness Combinations\nCiena records acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. All of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, contractual contingencies and contingent consideration are recognized at their fair value as of the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net tangible and net intangible assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The application of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions in the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, in order to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized from goodwill. These assumptions and estimates include a market participants use of the asset and the appropriate discount rates for a market participant. Cienas estimates are based on historical experience, information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and, when appropriate, include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. Significant assumptions and\nestimates can include, but are not limited to, the cash flows that an asset is expected to generate in the future, the appropriate weighted-average cost of capital and the cost savings expected to be derived from acquiring an asset. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for selling prices for multiple element arrangements, shared-based compensation, bad debts, valuation of inventories and investments, recoverability of intangible assets, other long-lived assets and goodwill, income taxes, warranty obligations, restructuring liabilities, derivatives, contingencies and litigation. Ciena bases its estimates on historical experience and assumptions that it believes are reasonable. Actual results may differ materially from managements estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCiena considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Any restricted cash collateralizing letters of credit is included in other current assets and other long-term assets depending on the duration of the restriction.\nInvestments\nCienas investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Ciena recognizes losses in the income statement when it determines that declines in the fair value of its investments below their cost basis are other-than-temporary. In determining whether a decline in fair value is other-than-temporary, Ciena considers various factors, including market price (when available), investment ratings, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than Cienas cost basis, and Cienas intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value. Ciena considers all marketable debt securities that it expects to convert to cash within one year or less to be short-term investments, with all others considered to be long-term investments.\nCiena has minority equity investments in privately held technology companies that are classified in other long-term assets. These investments are carried at cost because Ciena owns less than 20% of the voting equity and does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the company. Ciena monitors these investments for impairment and makes appropriate reductions to the carrying value when necessary. As of October 28, 2023, the combined carrying value of these investments was minimal. Ciena elects to estimate the fair value at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Ciena evaluates these investments for impairment or observable price changes quarterly and records adjustments to interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost, on a first-in, first-out basis. Ciena records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory when an impairment has been identified.\nSegment Reporting\nCienas chief operating decision maker, its chief executive officer, evaluates the Companys performance and allocates resources based on multiple factors, including measures of segment profit (loss). Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise that engage in business activities that may earn revenue and incur expense, for which discrete financial information is available, and for which such information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance. Ciena has the following operating segments for reporting purposes: (i) Networking Platforms; (ii) Platform Software and Services; (iii) Blue Planet Automation Software and Services; and (iv) Global Services. See Note 25 below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair values assigned to the net assets acquired in a business combination. Ciena tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, which it has determined to be the last business day of fiscal September each year. Ciena also tests goodwill for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value.\nAnnually, Ciena tests goodwill impairment qualitatively, or quantitatively by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the units carrying amount, including goodwill. If this test indicates that the fair value is less than the carrying value, then an impairment loss is recognized limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. A non-cash goodwill impairment charge would have the effect of decreasing earnings or increasing losses in such period. If Ciena is required to take a substantial impairment charge, its operating results would be materially adversely affected in such period.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets include equipment, building, furniture and fixtures, operating right-of-use (ROU) assets, finite-lived intangible assets and maintenance spares. Ciena tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows. An impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value. Cienas long-lived assets are assigned to asset groups that represent the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified.\nEquipment, Building, Furniture and Fixtures and Internal Use Software\nEquipment, building, furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method, generally over useful lives of three years to five years for equipment and furniture and fixtures and the shorter of useful life or lease term for leasehold improvements.\nQualifying internal use software and website development costs incurred during the application development stage, which consist primarily of outside services and purchased software license costs, are capitalized and amortized straight-line over the estimated useful lives of two years to five years.\nLeases\nAt the inception of a contract, Ciena must determine whether the contract is or contains a lease. The contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of the property, plant, or equipment for a designated term in exchange for consideration. Cienas evaluation of its contracts follows the assessment of whether there is a right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use and the right to direct the use of the identified asset in the contract. Operating leases are included in the Operating ROU assets, Operating lease liabilities and Long-term operating lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Equipment, building, furniture and fixtures, net (Finance ROU assets), Accrued liabilities and other short-term obligations and Other long-term obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCiena has operating and finance leases that primarily relate to real property. Ciena has elected not to capitalize leases with a term of 12 months or less without a purchase option that it is likely to exercise. Ciena has elected not to separate lease and non-lease components of operating and finance leases. Lease components are payment items directly attributable to the use of the underlying asset, while non-lease components are explicit elements of a contract not directly related to the use of the underlying asset, including pass-through operating expenses like common area maintenance and utilities.\nOperating ROU assets and lease liabilities and Finance ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the present value of the future lease payments over the life of the lease term. Ciena uses discount rates based on incremental borrowing rates, on a collateralized basis, for the respective underlying assets, for terms similar to the respective leases when implicit rates for leases are not determinable. Operating lease costs are included as rent expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Fixed base payments on operating leases paid directly to the lessor are recorded as lease expense on a straight-line basis. Related variable payments based on usage, changes in an index, or market rate are expensed as incurred. Finance ROU assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the lease term with the interest expense on the lease liability recorded using the interest method. The amortization and interest expense are recorded separately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIntangible Assets\nCiena has recorded finite-lived intangible assets as a result of several acquisitions. Finite-lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the expected economic lives of the respective assets, up to seven years, which approximates the use of intangible assets.\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nCiena capitalizes certain costs related to hosting arrangements that are service contracts (cloud computing arrangements). Capitalized costs are included in Other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life.\nMaintenance Spares\nMaintenance spares are recorded at cost. Ciena depreciates spares ratably over four years.\nConcentrations\nSubstantially all of Cienas cash and cash equivalents are maintained at a small number of major U.S. financial institutions. The majority of Cienas cash equivalents consist of money market funds. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Because these deposits generally may be redeemed upon demand, management believes that they bear minimal risk.\nHistorically, a significant percentage of Cienas revenue has been concentrated among sales to a small number of large communications service providers and cloud providers. Consolidation among Cienas customers has increased this concentration. Consequently, Cienas accounts receivable are concentrated among these customers. See Note 2 below.\nAdditionally, Cienas access to certain materials or components is dependent on sole or limited source suppliers. The inability of any of these suppliers to fulfill Cienas supply requirements, or significant changes in supply cost, could affect future results. Ciena relies on a small number of contract manufacturers to perform the majority of the manufacturing for its products. If Ciena cannot effectively manage these manufacturers or forecast future demand, or if these manufacturers fail to deliver products or components on time, Cienas business and results of operations may suffer.\nRevenue Recognition\nCiena recognizes revenue when control of the promised products or services is transferred to its customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Ciena expects to be entitled in exchange for those products or services.\nCiena determines revenue recognition by applying the following five-step approach:\nidentification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\nidentification of the performance obligations in the contract;\ndetermination of the transaction price;\nallocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\nrecognition of revenue when, or as, Ciena satisfies a performance obligation.\nGenerally, Ciena makes sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of Cienas products and services. These purchase orders under framework agreements are used to determine the identification of the contract or contracts with this customer. Purchase orders typically include the description, quantity, and price of each product or service purchased. Purchase orders may include one-line bundled pricing for both products and services. Accordingly, purchase orders can include various combinations of products and services that are generally distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Ciena evaluates each promised product and service offering to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation. In doing so, Ciena considers, among other things, customary business practices, whether the customer can benefit from the product or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available, and whether Cienas commitment to transfer the product or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other obligations in the purchase order. For transactions where Ciena delivers the product or services, Ciena is typically the principal and records revenue and costs of goods sold on a gross basis.\nPurchase orders are invoiced based on the terms set forth either in the purchase order or the framework agreement, as applicable. Generally, sales of products and software licenses are invoiced upon shipment or delivery. Maintenance and\nsoftware subscription services are invoiced quarterly or annually in advance of the service term. Cienas other service offerings are generally invoiced upon completion of the service. Payment terms and cash received typically range from 30 to 90 days from the invoicing date. Historically, Ciena has not provided any material financing arrangements to its customers. As a practical expedient, Ciena does not adjust the amount of consideration it will receive for the effects of a significant financing component as it expects, at contract inception, that the period between Cienas transfer of the products or services to the customer and customer payment for the products or services will be one year or less. Shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers are included in revenue, with the associated expense included in product cost of goods sold. Ciena records revenue net of any associated sales taxes.\nCiena recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to a customer. Transfer of control occurs once the customer has the contractual right to use the product, generally upon shipment or delivery to the customer. Transfer of control can also occur over time for services such as software subscription, maintenance, installation, and various professional services as the customer receives the benefit over the contract term.\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is allocated among performance obligations based on standalone selling price (SSP). SSP reflects the price at which Ciena would expect to sell that product or service on a stand-alone basis at contract inception and that Ciena would expect to be entitled to receive for the promised products or services. SSP is estimated for each distinct performance obligation, and judgment may be required in its determination. The best evidence of SSP is the observable price of a product or service when Ciena sells the products separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, Ciena determines SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nCiena applies judgment in determining the transaction price, as Ciena may be required to estimate variable consideration when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Variable consideration can include various rebate, cooperative marketing, and other incentive programs that Ciena offers to its distributors, partners and customers. When determining the amount of revenue to recognize, Ciena estimates the expected usage of these programs, applying the expected value or most likely estimate and updates the estimate at each reporting period as actual utilization data becomes available. Ciena also considers any customer right of return and any actual or potential payment of liquidated damages, contractual or similar penalties, or other claims for performance failures or delays in determining the transaction price, where applicable.\nWhen transfer of control is judged to be over time for installation and professional service arrangements, Ciena applies the input method to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in a given period. Utilizing the input method, Ciena recognizes revenue based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs expected to be incurred. Revenue for software subscription and maintenance is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed.\nCapitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\nCiena has considered the impact of the guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs; Contracts with Customers, and the interpretations of the FASB Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition with respect to capitalization and amortization of incremental costs of obtaining a contract. In conjunction with this interpretation, Ciena considers each customer purchase in combination with the corresponding framework agreement, if applicable, as a contract. Ciena has elected to implement the practical expedient, which allows for incremental costs to be recognized as an expense when incurred if the period of the asset recognition is one year or less. If the period of the asset recognition is greater than one year, Ciena amortizes these costs over the period of performance. Ciena considers sales commissions incurred upon receipt of purchase orders placed by customers as incremental costs to obtain such purchase orders. The practical expedient method is applied to the purchase order as a whole and thus the capitalized costs of obtaining a purchase order is applied even if the purchase order contains more than one performance obligation. In cases where a purchase order includes various distinct products or services with both short-term (one year or less) and long-term (more than a year) performance periods, the cost of commissions incurred for the total value of the purchase order is capitalized and subsequently amortized as each performance obligation is recognized.\nFor the additional disclosures on capitalized contract acquisition costs, see Note 2 below.\nWarranty Accruals\nCiena provides for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon recognition of the related revenue. Estimated warranty costs include estimates for material costs, technical support labor costs and associated overhead. Warranty\nis included in cost of goods sold and is determined based on actual warranty cost experience, estimates of component failure rates and managements industry experience. Cienas sales contracts do not permit the right of return of the product by the customer after the product has been accepted.\nAllowance for Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets\nCiena estimates its allowances for credit losses using relevant available information from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. When assessing for credit losses, Ciena determines collectability by pooling assets with similar characteristics. The allowances for credit losses are each measured on a collective basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The allowances for credit losses are each measured by multiplying the exposure probability of default (the probability that the asset will default within a given time frame) by the loss given default rate (the percentage of the asset not expected to be collected due to default) based on the pool of assets.\nProbability of default rates are published by third-party credit rating agencies. Adjustments to Cienas exposure probability may take into account a number of factors, including, but not limited to, various customer-specific factors, the potential sovereign risk of the geographic locations in which the customer is operating and macroeconomic conditions. These factors are updated regularly or when facts and circumstances indicate that an update is deemed necessary.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nCiena has entered into factoring agreements to sell certain receivables to unrelated third-party financial institution on a non-recourse basis. These transactions are accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing and result in a reduction in accounts receivable because the agreements transfer effective control over, and risk related to, the receivables to the buyers. Ciena's factoring agreements do not allow for recourse in the event of uncollectability, and Ciena does not retain any interest in the underlying accounts receivable once sold. Trade accounts receivables balances sold are removed from the consolidated balance sheets and cash received is reflected as cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Factoring related interest expense is recorded to interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 9 below.\nResearch and Development\nCiena charges all research and development costs to expense as incurred. Types of expense incurred in research and development include employee compensation, prototype equipment, consulting and third-party services, depreciation, facility costs and information technology.\nGovernment Grants\nCiena accounts for proceeds from government grants as a reduction of expense when there is reasonable assurance that Ciena has met the required conditions associated with the grant and that grant proceeds will be received. Grant benefits are recorded to the particular line item of the Consolidated Statement of Operations to which the grant activity relates. See Notes 3 below.\nAdvertising Costs\nCiena expenses all advertising costs as incurred.\nLegal Costs\nCiena expenses legal costs associated with litigation as incurred.\nShare-Based Compensation Expense\nCiena measures and recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards and employee stock purchases related to its Amended and Restated 2003 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. Ciena estimates the fair value of employee stock purchases related to the ESPP using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Ciena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject only to service-based vesting conditions by multiplying the number of shares underlying the award by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. In each case, Ciena only recognizes expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations for those restricted stock units that ultimately vest. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions (i) require the achievement of certain operational, financial or other performance criteria or targets or (ii) vest based on Cienas total stockholder return as compared to an index of peer companies, in whole or in part. Ciena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions other than total stockholder return by assuming the satisfaction of any performance-based objectives at the target level and multiplying the corresponding number of shares earned based upon such achievement by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. Ciena recognizes the estimated fair value of performance based awards subject to total stockholder return as compared to an index of peer companies using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model on the date of grant. At the end of each reporting period, Ciena reassesses the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets. See Note 24 below.\nStock Repurchase Program\nShares repurchased pursuant to Cienas stock repurchase program are immediately retired upon purchase. Repurchased common stock is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity. Cienas accounting policy related to its share repurchases is to reduce its common stock based on the par value of the shares and to reduce its capital surplus for the excess of the repurchase price over the par value. Since the inception of its stock repurchase programs, Ciena has had an accumulated deficit balance; therefore, the excess over the par value has been applied to additional paid-in capital. Once Ciena has retained earnings, the excess will be charged entirely to retained earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nCiena accounts for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. This approach recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities (DTA) for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases, and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In estimating future tax consequences, Ciena considers all expected future events other than the enactment of changes in tax laws or rates. Valuation allowances are provided if, based on the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nIn the ordinary course of business, transactions occur for which the ultimate outcome may be uncertain. In addition, tax authorities periodically audit Cienas income tax returns. These audits examine significant tax filing positions, including the timing and amounts of deductions and the allocation of income tax expenses among tax jurisdictions. Ciena is currently under audit in India for 2018 through 2021, in Canada for 2014, and in the United Kingdom for 2016 through 2021. Management does not expect the outcome of these audits to have a material adverse effect on Cienas consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Cienas major tax jurisdictions and the earliest open tax years are as follows: United States (2020), United Kingdom (2016), Canada (2014), and India (2018). Limited adjustments can be made to federal U.S. tax returns in earlier years in order to reduce net operating loss carryforwards. Ciena classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nCiena is required to record excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation as income tax benefit or expense when share-based awards vest or are settled.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) includes provisions that affected Ciena starting in fiscal 2019, including a provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). An accounting policy choice is allowed to either treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions related to GILTI in taxable income as a current-period expense when incurred (the period cost method) or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes (the deferred method). The calculation of the deferred balance with respect to the GILTI tax provisions will depend, in part, on analyzing global income to determine whether future U.S. inclusions in taxable income are expected related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. Ciena is electing to use the period cost method for future GILTI inclusions. Additionally, Ciena is electing to use the incremental cash tax savings approach when determining whether a valuation allowance needs to be recorded against the U.S. net operating loss (NOL) due to the GILTI inclusions.\nThe Tax Act also introduced an alternative tax known as the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT). An accounting policy choice has been made to consider BEAT as a period cost when incurred.\nLoss Contingencies\nCiena is subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business. These may relate to disputes, litigation and other legal actions. Ciena considers the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability, as well as Cienas ability to estimate the amount of loss reasonably, in determining loss contingencies. An estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Ciena regularly evaluates current information available to it in order to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying value of Cienas cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximates fair market value due to the relatively short period of time to maturity. For information related to the fair value of Cienas short-term and long-term debt, see Note 19 below.\nFair value for the measurement of financial assets and liabilities is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Ciena utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs for fair value measurement. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel 2 inputs are quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in less active markets or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument; and\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on Cienas assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. The fair values are determined based on model-based techniques using inputs Ciena could not corroborated with market data.\nBy distinguishing between inputs that are observable in the marketplace, and therefore more objective, and those that are unobservable, and therefore more subjective, the hierarchy is designed to indicate the relative reliability of the fair value measurements. A financial assets or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nRestructuring\nFrom time to time, Ciena takes actions to align its workforce, facilities and operating costs with perceived market opportunities, business strategies and changes in market and business conditions and redesign business processes. Ciena recognizes a liability for the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity in the period in which the liability is incurred, except for one-time employee termination benefits related to a service period, typically of more than 60 days, which are accrued over the service period. See Note 5 below.\nForeign Currency\nCertain of Cienas foreign branch offices and subsidiaries use the U.S. Dollar as their functional currency because Ciena Corporation, as the U.S. parent entity, exclusively funds the operations of these branch offices and subsidiaries. For those subsidiaries using the local currency as their functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, and the statement of operations is translated at a monthly average rate. Resulting translation adjustments are recorded directly to a separate component of stockholders equity. Where the monetary assets and liabilities are transacted in a currency other than the entitys functional currency, re-measurement adjustments are recorded in interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 6 below.\nDerivatives\nFrom time to time, Ciena uses foreign currency forward contracts to reduce variability in certain forecasted non-U.S. Dollar denominated cash flows. Generally, these derivatives have maturities of 24 months or less. Ciena also has interest rate swap arrangements to reduce variability in certain forecasted interest expense associated with its term loans. All of these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges. Ciena also uses foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on is net investments in foreign operations. Generally, these derivatives have maturities of 24 months or less. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges. At the inception of these hedges, and on an ongoing basis, Ciena assesses whether the derivative has been effective in offsetting changes attributable to the hedged risk during the hedging period. The derivatives net gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction, is subsequently reclassified to the line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the hedged transaction relates.\nCiena records derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows within operating, investing, or financing activities consistent with the cash flows of the hedged items.\nFrom time to time, Ciena uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet foreign exchange exposures. These forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and any net gain or loss associated with these derivatives is reported in interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee Notes 8 and 16 below.\nComputation of Net Income per Share\nCiena calculates basic net income per common share (Basic EPS) by dividing earnings attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per potential common share (Diluted EPS) includes other potential dilutive shares that would be outstanding if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. Ciena uses a dual presentation of Basic EPS and Diluted EPS on the face of its income statement. A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used for the Basic EPS and Diluted EPS computations is set forth in Note 21 below.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCiena develops software for sale to its customers. GAAP requires the capitalization of certain software development costs that are incurred subsequent to the date technological feasibility is established and prior to the date the product is generally available for sale. The capitalized cost is then amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated life of the product. Ciena defines technological feasibility as being attained at the time a working model is completed. To date, the period between Ciena achieving technological feasibility and the general availability of such software has been short, and software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant. Accordingly, Ciena has not capitalized any software development costs.\nNewly Issued Accounting Standards - Not Yet Effective\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08 (ASU 2021-08), Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination to address recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Ciena does not expect adoption of ASU 2021-08 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 (ASU 2023-07), Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 on a retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Ciena is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09 (ASU 2023-09), Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvement to Income Tax Disclosures to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024 on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Ciena is currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\n(2) REVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nCienas disaggregated revenue as presented below depicts the nature, amount, and timing of revenue and cash flows for similar groupings of Cienas various offerings. The sales cycle, contractual obligations, customer requirements, and go-to-market strategies may differ for each of its product categories, resulting in different economic risk profiles for each category. Effective as of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Ciena renamed its Converged Packet Optical product line to Optical Networking. This change, affecting only the presentation of such information, was made on a prospective basis and does not impact comparability of previous financial results. However, references to prior reported Converged Packet Optical product line have been changed herein to Optical Networking.\nThe tables below set forth Cienas disaggregated revenue for the respective period (in thousands):\nYear Ended October 28, 2023\nNetworking Platforms Platform Software and Services Blue Planet Automation Software and Services Global Services Total\nProduct lines:\nOptical Networking $ 2,987,245 $ - $ - $ - $ 2,987,245\nRouting and Switching 506,247 - - - 506,247\nPlatform Software and Services - 303,873 - - 303,873\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services - - 69,170 - 69,170\nMaintenance Support and Training - - - 288,334 288,334\nInstallation and Deployment - - - 180,951 180,951\nConsulting and Network Design - - - 50,729 50,729\nTotal revenue by product line $ 3,493,492 $ 303,873 $ 69,170 $ 520,014 $ 4,386,549\nTiming of revenue recognition:\nProducts and services at a point in time $ 3,493,492 $ 67,013 $ 21,842 $ 55,036 $ 3,637,383\nProducts and services transferred over time - 236,860 47,328 464,978 749,166\nTotal revenue by timing of revenue recognition $ 3,493,492 $ 303,873 $ 69,170 $ 520,014 $ 4,386,549\nYear Ended October 29, 2022\nNetworking Platforms Platform Software and Services Blue Planet Automation Software and Services Global Services Total\nProduct lines:\nOptical Networking $ 2,379,931 $ - $ - $ - $ 2,379,931\nRouting and Switching 398,439 - - - 398,439\nPlatform Software and Services\n- 277,191 - - 277,191\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services\n- - 76,567 - 76,567\nMaintenance Support and Training\n- - - 292,375 292,375\nInstallation and Deployment\n- - - 157,443 157,443\nConsulting and Network Design\n- - - 50,715 50,715\nTotal revenue by product line\n$ 2,778,370 $ 277,191 $ 76,567 $ 500,533 $ 3,632,661\nTiming of revenue recognition:\nProducts and services at a point in time\n$ 2,778,370 $ 85,691 $ 25,540 $ 44,091 $ 2,933,692\nProducts and services transferred over time\n- 191,500 51,027 456,442 698,969\nTotal revenue by timing of revenue recognition\n$ 2,778,370 $ 277,191 $ 76,567 $ 500,533 $ 3,632,661\nYear Ended October 30, 2021\nNetworking Platforms Platform Software and Services Blue Planet Automation Software and Services Global Services Total\nProduct lines:\nOptical Networking $ 2,553,509 $ - $ - $ - $ 2,553,509\nRouting and Switching 271,796 - - - 271,796\nPlatform Software and Services\n- 229,588 - - 229,588\nBlue Planet Automation Software and Services\n- - 77,247 - 77,247\nMaintenance Support and Training\n- - - 283,350 283,350\nInstallation and Deployment\n- - - 171,489 171,489\nConsulting and Network Design\n- - - 33,705 33,705\nTotal revenue by product line\n$ 2,825,305 $ 229,588 $ 77,247 $ 488,544 $ 3,620,684\nTiming of revenue recognition:\nProducts and services at a point in time\n$ 2,825,305 $ 80,359 $ 27,621 $ 14,923 $ 2,948,208\nProducts and services transferred over time\n- 149,229 49,626 473,621 672,476\nTotal revenue by timing of revenue recognition\n$ 2,825,305 $ 229,588 $ 77,247 $ 488,544 $ 3,620,684\nCiena reports its sales geographically around the following markets: (i) the United States, Canada, the Caribbean and Latin America (Americas); (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); and (iii) Asia Pacific, Japan and India (APAC). Within each geographic area, Ciena maintains specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as services professionals and commercial management personnel.

Revenue from maintenance support is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Revenue from installation and deployment services and consulting and network design services is recognized over time with Ciena applying the input method to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in a given period. Revenue from training services is generally recognized at a point in time upon completion of the service.\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about receivables, contract assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from contracts with customers (in thousands):\nBalance at October 28, 2023 Balance at October 29, 2022\nAccounts receivable, net $ 1,003,876 $ 920,772\nContract assets for unbilled accounts receivable, net $ 150,312 $ 156,039\nDeferred revenue $ 228,460 $ 200,235\nCienas contract assets represent unbilled accounts receivable, net, where transfer of a product or service has occurred but invoicing is conditional upon completion of future performance obligations. These amounts are primarily related to installation and deployment and professional services arrangements where transfer of control has occurred, but Ciena has not yet invoiced the customer. Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 11 below.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue and represent advanced payments received from customers against non-cancelable customer orders received prior to revenue recognition. Ciena recognized approximately $135.5 million and $111.3 million of revenue during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. Revenue recognized due to changes in transaction price from performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in previous periods was immaterial during fiscal 2023 and 2022.\nCapitalized Contract Acquisition Costs\nCapitalized contract acquisition costs consist of deferred sales commissions and were $30.2 million and $39.7 million as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively, and are included in (i) prepaid expenses and other and (ii) other long-term assets. The amortization expense associated with these costs was $34.2 million and $27.3 million during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, and are included in selling and marketing expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO) are comprised of non-cancelable customer purchase orders for products and services that are awaiting transfer of control for revenue recognition under the applicable contract terms. As of October 28, 2023, the aggregate amount of RPO was $1.8 billion. As of October 28, 2023, Ciena expects approximately 81% of the RPO to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months.\n(3) CANADIAN EMERGENCY WAGE SUBSIDY\nIn April 2020, the Canadian government introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, retroactive to March 15, 2020. The CEWS program expired in October 2021. The subsidy covered employers of all sizes and across all sectors.\nCiena accounts for proceeds from government grants as a reduction of expense when there is reasonable assurance that Ciena has met the required conditions associated with the grant and that grant proceeds will be received. Grant benefits are recorded to the particular line item of the Consolidated Statements of Operations to which the grant activity relates. Amounts from the CEWS program positively impacted Cienas operating expense and measures of profit in the year ended October 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021, Ciena recorded a CAD$52.2 million ($41.3 million) benefit, net of certain fees, related to CEWS for claim periods beginning March 15, 2020, including CAD$43.9 million ($35.4 million) related to employee wages during fiscal 2020. There was no CEWS activity in fiscal 2023 or 2022.\nThe following table summarizes CEWS for the period indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended October 30, 2021\nProduct $ 4,283\nService 2,667\nCEWS benefit in cost of goods sold 6,950\nResearch and development 29,519\nSales and marketing 2,604\nGeneral and administrative 2,207\nCEWS benefit in operating expense 34,330\nTotal CEWS benefit $ 41,280\n(4) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nFiscal 2023 Acquisitions: Benu and Tibit\nOn November 17, 2022, Ciena acquired Benu, a portfolio of cloud-native software solutions, including a virtual Broadband Network Gateway ((v)BNG), that complements Cienas existing portfolio of broadband access solutions. On December 30, 2022, Ciena acquired Tibit, a provider and developer of passive optical network (PON)-specific hardware and operating software that can be integrated into a carrier-grade Ethernet switch and will strengthen Cienas portfolio of next-generation PON solutions that support residential, enterprise, and mobility use cases. These businesses were acquired for an aggregate of approximately $291.7 million, of which $244.7 million was paid in cash, and $47.0 million represents the fair value of Cienas previously held cost method equity investment in Tibit. The acquisition of Tibit triggered the remeasurement of Cienas previously held investment in Tibit to fair value, which resulted in Ciena recognizing a gain on its cost method equity investment of $26.5 million. Each of these transactions has been accounted for as the acquisition of a business.\nCiena incurred approximately $3.4 million in acquisition-related costs associated with these acquisitions. These costs and expenses primarily include fees associated with financial, legal, and accounting advisors and employment-related costs. These costs were recorded in acquisition and integration costs on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation related to the acquisitions based on the estimated fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (in thousands):\nAmount\nCash and cash equivalents $ 14,634\nAccounts receivable, net 443\nInventories, net 1,406\nPrepaid expenses and other 810\nEquipment, furniture and fixtures 1,090\nGoodwill 116,644\nDeveloped technology 75,400\nIn-process technology 89,100\nCustomer relationships and contracts 18,400\nOrder backlog 2,480\nDeferred tax asset, net (26,429)\nAccounts payable (420)\nAccrued liabilities and other short-term obligations (874)\nDeferred revenue (851)\nOther long-term obligations (144)\nTotal purchase consideration $ 291,689\nDeveloped technology represents purchased technology that has reached technological feasibility and for which the acquired companies had substantially completed development as of the date of acquisition. Fair value was determined using future discounted cash flows related to the projected income stream of the developed technology for a discrete projection period. Cash flows were discounted to their present value as of the closing date. Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of five years.\nIn-process technology represents purchased technology that had not reached technological feasibility as of the date of acquisition. Fair value was determined using future discounted cash flows related to the projected income stream of the in-process technology for a discrete projection period. Cash flows were discounted to their present value as of the closing date. Upon completion of the in-process technology, it will be amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, which will be determined on that date.\nCustomer relationships and contracts represent agreements with existing Tibit customers and have an estimated useful life of three years. Order backlog is amortized over the fulfillment period.\nThe goodwill generated from these acquisitions is primarily related to expected economic synergies. The total goodwill amount was recorded in the Networking Platforms segment. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nPro forma disclosures have not been included due to immateriality. The amounts of revenue and earnings for these acquisitions since the acquisition dates, which are included on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the reporting period, are immaterial.\nFiscal 2022 Acquisitions: Vyatta and Xelic\nOn November 1, 2021, Ciena acquired AT&Ts Vyatta Software Technology (Vyatta), a provider of software-based virtual routing and switching technology. AT&T is a customer of Ciena; see Note 2 above. On March 9, 2022, Ciena acquired Xelic, Inc., a provider and developer of field programmable gate array (FPGA) and application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) technology and optical networking IP cores. These businesses were acquired for an aggregate of approximately $64.1 million, of which $63.3 million was paid in cash and $0.8 million represents a future payable arrangement. These transactions have each been accounted for as the acquisition of a business.\nCiena incurred approximately $1.7 million in acquisition-related costs associated with these acquisitions. These costs and expenses primarily include fees associated with financial, legal and accounting advisors. These costs were recorded in acquisition and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation related to the acquisitions based on the estimated fair value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities (in thousands):\nAmount\nCash and cash equivalents $ 201\nPrepaid expenses and other 1,614\nEquipment, furniture and fixtures 694\nCustomer relationships and contracts 15,800\nDeveloped technology 32,491\nGoodwill 17,698\nAccrued liabilities (4,434)\nTotal purchase consideration $ 64,064\nCustomer relationships and contracts represent agreements with existing Vyatta customers and have an estimated useful life of two years.\nDeveloped technology represents purchased technology that has reached technological feasibility and for which the acquired companies had substantially completed development as of the date of acquisition. Fair value was determined using future discounted cash flows related to the projected income stream of the developed technology for a discrete projection period. Cash flows were discounted to their present value as of the closing date. Developed technology is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of five years.\nThe goodwill generated from these acquisitions are primarily related to expected economic synergies.

The following table sets forth the restructuring activity and balance of the restructuring liability accounts, which are included in accrued liabilities and other short-term obligations on Cienas Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands):\nWorkforce\nreduction Other restructuring activities Total\nBalance at October 31, 2020 $ 2,915 $ - $ 2,915\nCharges 5,938 (1)\n23,627 (2)\n29,565\nCash payments (8,072) (23,627) (31,699)\nBalance at October 30, 2021 781 - 781\nCharges 3,156 (1)\n26,814 (2)\n29,970\nCash payments (2,722) (22,194) (24,916)\nBalance at October 29, 2022 1,215 4,620 5,835\nCharges 6,885 (1)\n16,949 (2)\n23,834\nCash payments (6,187) (21,569) (27,756)\nBalance at October 28, 2023 $ 1,913 $ - $ 1,913\nCurrent restructuring liabilities $ 1,913 $ - $ 1,913\n_________________________________\n(1) Reflects employee costs associated with workforce reductions as part of a business optimization strategy to improve gross margin, constrain operating expense and redesign certain business processes.\n(2) Primarily represents the redesign of certain business processes associated with Cienas supply chain and distribution structure reorganization and costs related to restructured real estate facilities.\nSignificant Asset Impairments\nIn February 2022, armed conflict escalated between Russia and Ukraine. The United States and certain other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia and could impose further sanctions. On March 7, 2022, Ciena announced its decision to suspend its business operations in Russia immediately. As a result, Ciena recorded impairment charges of approximately $3.8 million of which $1.8 million was a provision for credit losses.\n(6) INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (LOSS), NET\nThe components of interest and other income (loss), net, were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nInterest income $ 45,011 $ 10,060 $ 2,051\nGains (losses) on non-hedge designated foreign currency forward contracts (3,896) (4,018) 11,172\nForeign currency exchange gains (losses) (427) 2,501 (14,622)\nGain on cost method equity investments, net 26,368 4,120 164\nOther (5,048) (5,916) (533)\nInterest and other income (loss), net $ 62,008 $ 6,747 $ (1,768)\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the acquisition of Tibit triggered the remeasurement of Cienas previously held investment in Tibit to fair value, which resulted in Ciena recognizing a gain on its cost method equity investment of $26.5 million. See Note 4 above. During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, Ciena recorded a net gain of $26.4 million and $4.1 million, respectively, on its cost method equity investments.\nCiena Corporation, as the U.S. parent entity, uses the U.S. Dollar as its functional currency; however, some of its foreign branch offices and subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency. During fiscal 2023 and 2021, Ciena recorded $0.4 million and $14.6 million, respectively, in exchange rate losses as a result of monetary assets and liabilities that were transacted in a currency other than the entitys functional currency. During fiscal 2022, Ciena recorded $2.5 million in exchange rate gains as a result of monetary assets and liabilities that were transacted in a currency other than the entitys functional currency. The related remeasurement adjustments were recorded in interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. From time to time, Ciena uses foreign currency forwards to hedge certain of these balance sheet exposures. These forwards are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, and any net gain or loss associated with these derivatives is also reported in interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. During fiscal 2023 and 2022, Ciena recorded losses of $3.9 million and $4.0 million, respectively, from non-hedge designated foreign currency forward contracts. During fiscal 2021, Ciena recorded a gain of $11.2 million from non-hedge designated foreign currency forward contracts.\n(7) CASH EQUIVALENT, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS\nAs of the dates indicated, investments classified as available-for-sale are comprised of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized\nGains Gross Unrealized\nLosses Estimated Fair\nValue\nU.S. government obligations $ 170,260 $ 28 $ (379) $ 169,909\nCorporate debt securities 59,683 1 (115) 59,569\nTime deposits 138,830 4 (5) 138,829\n$ 368,773 $ 33 $ (499) $ 368,307\nIncluded in cash equivalents $ 129,276 $ - $ - $ 129,276\nIncluded in short-term investments 105,042 4 (293) 104,753\nIncluded in long-term investments 134,455 29 (206) 134,278\n$ 368,773 $ 33 $ (499) $ 368,307\nOctober 29, 2022\nAmortized Cost Gross Unrealized\nGains Gross Unrealized\nLosses Estimated Fair\nValue\nU.S. government obligations $ 137,963 $ - $ (3,379) $ 134,584\nCorporate debt securities 54,899 1 (405) 54,495\nTime deposits 55,889 - (64) 55,825\n$ 248,751 $ 1 $ (3,848) $ 244,904\nIncluded in cash equivalents $ 55,530 $ - $ - $ 55,530\nIncluded in short-term investments 156,430 1 (2,442) 153,989\nIncluded in long-term investments 36,791 - (1,406) 35,385\n$ 248,751 $ 1 $ (3,848) $ 244,904\nThe following table summarizes the legal maturities of debt investments at October 28, 2023 (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023\nAmortized Cost Estimated Fair\nValue\nLess than one year $ 234,318 $ 234,029\nDue in 1-2 years 134,455 134,278\n$ 368,773 $ 368,307\n(8) FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAs of the dates indicated, the following tables summarize the fair value of assets and liabilities that were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 661,101 $ - $ - $ 661,101\nBond mutual fund 104,171 - - 104,171\nTime deposits 138,829 - - 138,829\nDeferred compensation plan assets 11,456 - - 11,456\nU.S. government obligations - 169,909 - 169,909\nCorporate debt securities - 59,569 - 59,569\nForeign currency forward contracts - 1,119 - 1,119\nInterest rate swaps - 24,953 - 24,953\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 915,557 $ 255,550 $ - $ 1,171,107\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency forward contracts $ - $ 14,509 $ - $ 14,509\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 14,509 $ - $ 14,509\nOctober 29, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nMoney market funds $ 639,024 $ - $ - $ 639,024\nBond mutual fund 71,145 - - 71,145\nTime deposits 55,825 - - 55,825\nDeferred compensation plan assets 12,751 - - 12,751\nU.S. government obligations - 134,584 - 134,584\nCommercial paper - 54,495 - 54,495\nForeign currency forward contracts - 251 - 251\nInterest rate swaps - 12,306 - 12,306\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 778,745 $ 201,636 $ - $ 980,381\nLiabilities:\nForeign currency forward contracts $ - $ 15,605 $ - $ 15,605\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 15,605 $ - $ 15,605\nAs of the dates indicated, the assets and liabilities above were presented on Cienas Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 891,788 $ 2,760 $ - $ 894,548\nShort-term investments 12,313 92,440 - 104,753\nPrepaid expenses and other - 1,119 - 1,119\nLong-term investments - 134,278 - 134,278\nOther long-term assets 11,456 24,953 - 36,409\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 915,557 $ 255,550 $ - $ 1,171,107\nLiabilities:\nAccrued liabilities and other short-term obligations $ - $ 14,509 $ - $ 14,509\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 14,509 $ - $ 14,509\nOctober 29, 2022\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nCash equivalents $ 757,725 $ 7,974 $ - $ 765,699\nShort-term investments 8,269 145,720 - 153,989\nPrepaid expenses and other - 251 - 251\nLong-term investments - 35,385 - 35,385\nOther long-term assets 12,751 12,306 - 25,057\nTotal assets measured at fair value $ 778,745 $ 201,636 $ - $ 980,381\nLiabilities:\nAccrued liabilities and other short-term obligations $ - $ 15,605 $ - $ 15,605\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value $ - $ 15,605 $ - $ 15,605\nCiena did not have any transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the periods presented.\n(9) ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nAs of October 28, 2023, two customers accounted for 11.0% and 10.0% of net accounts receivable, respectively. As of October 29, 2022, two customers accounted for 13.0% and 11.0% of net accounts receivable, respectively. Ciena has not historically experienced a significant amount of bad debt expense. The following table summarizes the activity in Cienas allowance for credit losses for the fiscal years indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended Beginning Balance Effect of adoption of new accounting standard Provisions Net Deductions Ending Balance\nOctober 30, 2021\n$ 10,598 $ 2,206 $ 2,346 $ 4,238 $ 10,912\nOctober 29, 2022(1)\n$ 10,912 $ - $ 4,199 $ 4,153 $ 10,958\nOctober 28, 2023\n$ 10,958 $ - $ 5,718 $ 5,022 $ 11,654\n(1) On March 7, 2022, Ciena announced its decision to suspend its business operations in Russia immediately. As a result, Cienas allowance for doubtful accounts includes a provision for a significant asset impairment of $1.8 million for a trade receivable related to this decision.\nAccounts Receivable Factoring\nDuring fiscal 2023 and 2022, the gross amount of trade accounts receivables sold totaled approximately $60.3 million and $11.8 million, respectively. Prior to the start of fiscal 2022, Ciena had not entered into any factoring arrangements. Factoring related expense recorded to interest and other income (loss), net was $3.1 million and $0.6 million for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.\n(10) INVENTORIES\nAs of the dates indicated, inventories are comprised of the following (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022\nRaw materials $ 664,797 $ 664,916\nWork-in-process 55,242 18,232\nFinished goods 314,168 258,584\nDeferred cost of goods sold 66,634 41,084\nGross inventories 1,100,841 982,816\nReserve for excess and obsolescence (50,003) (36,086)\nInventories, net $ 1,050,838 $ 946,730\nCiena has been expanding its manufacturing capacity and accumulating raw materials inventory of components that are available, in some cases with expanded lead times, in an effort to prepare Ciena to produce finished goods more quickly when supply constraints ease for certain common components, including integrated circuit components, for which delivery continues to be delayed. Raw materials inventory is related to the steps Ciena has taken to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints on its business and customers in recent prior periods and the global market shortage of semiconductor parts. The increase in finished goods inventories resulted primarily from planned fulfillment of customer advance orders for which some deliveries have been rescheduled outside of fiscal 2023.\nCiena makes estimates about future customer demand for its products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory. For fiscal 2023, future demand was calculated using both customer backlog and future forecasted sales. For fiscal 2022, future demand was calculated primarily based on customer backlog. Generally, Cienas customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept its products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance are rare. Ciena writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based on assumptions about future demand, which are affected by changes in Cienas strategic direction, discontinuance of a product or introduction of newer versions of products, declines in the sales of or forecasted demand for certain products,\nand general market conditions. During fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, Ciena recorded a provision for excess and obsolescence of $29.5 million, $16.2 million, and $17.9 million, respectively, primarily related to a decrease in the forecasted demand for certain Networking Platforms products.

To limit this exposure, Ciena entered into foreign currency contracts. Ciena does not enter into such contracts for speculative purposes.\nAs of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, Ciena had forward contracts to hedge its foreign exchange exposure in order to reduce variability that is principally related to research and development activities. The notional amount of these contracts was approximately $367.3 million and $272.2 million as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 24 months or less and have been designated as cash flow hedges.\nIn May 2023, Ciena entered into forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on its net investments in foreign operations. The notional amount of these contracts was approximately $48.0 million as of October 28, 2023. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 24 months or less and have been designated as net investment hedges.\nAs of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, Ciena had forward contracts to hedge its foreign exchange exposure in order to reduce the variability in various currencies of certain balance sheet items. The notional amount of these contracts was approximately $226.3 million and $108.0 million as of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, respectively. These foreign exchange contracts have maturities of 12 months or less and have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes.\nInterest Rate Derivatives\nCiena is exposed to floating rates of interest on its term loan borrowings (see Note 19 below) and has hedged such risk by entering into floating-to-fixed interest rate swap arrangements (interest rate swaps).\nPrior to amending our term loan due September 28, 2025 (the 2025 Term Loan) in January 2023, to replace LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), Ciena was exposed to floating rates of LIBOR interest on its 2025 Term Loan borrowings. In October 2018, Ciena hedged this risk by entering into interest rate swaps to fix the LIBOR rate for the first $350.0 million of its floating rate debt at 2.957% through September 2023. In January 2023, Ciena entered into a LIBOR to SOFR basis swap (basis swap) to hedge its exposure to SOFR rate. The basis swap offset the LIBOR exposure risk of the interest rate swaps and effectively fixed the SOFR rate for the first $350.0 million of its floating rate debt at 2.883% through September 2023. These swaps expired in September 2023. In April 2022, Ciena entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the SOFR rate for the first $350.0 million its floating rate debt at 2.968% from September 2023 through September 2025 (2025 interest rate swaps). The total notional amount of the 2025 interest swaps was $350.0 million as of October 28, 2023.\nIn January 2023, Ciena entered into interest rate swaps to fix the SOFR rate for an additional $350.0 million of its floating rate debt at 3.47% through January 2028 (2028 interest rate swaps). The total notional amount of the 2028 interest rate swaps in effect as of October 28, 2023 was $350.0 million.\nCiena expects the variable rate payments to be received under the terms interest rate swaps to offset exactly the forecasted variable rate payments on the equivalent notional amount of the 2030 New Term Loan (as defined in Note 19 below). These derivative contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges.\nOther information regarding Cienas derivatives is immaterial for separate financial statement presentation. See Notes 6 and 8 above.\n(17) ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated balances of other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of tax (in thousands):\nUnrealized Gain (Loss) on\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities Foreign\nCurrency Forward Contracts Interest Rate Swaps Cumulative Translation Adjustment Total\nBalance at October 31, 2020 $ 45 $ (219) $ (21,535) $ (13,649) $ (35,358)\nOther comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassifications (209) 16,856 (261) 20,215 36,601\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI - (10,421) 9,617 - (804)\nBalance at October 30, 2021 (164) 6,216 (12,179) 6,566 439\nOther comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassifications (2,801) (16,299) 14,512 (49,446) (54,034)\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI - (114) 7,064 - 6,950\nBalance at October 29, 2022 (2,965) (10,197) 9,397 (42,880) (46,645)\nOther comprehensive gain (loss) before reclassifications 2,593 (8,455) 19,600 (5,321) 8,417\nAmounts reclassified from AOCI - 10,496 (10,035) - 461\nBalance at October 28, 2023 $ (372) $ (8,156) $ 18,962 $ (48,201) $ (37,767)\nAll amounts reclassified from AOCI related to settlement (gains) losses on foreign currency forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges impacted research and development expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All amounts reclassified from AOCI related to settlement (gains) losses on interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges impacted interest and other income (loss), net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(18) LEASES\nCiena leases over 1.1 million square feet of facilities globally.

The 2030 New Term Loan requires Ciena to make installment payments of $2.9 million on a quarterly basis.\nBased on the continuation of existing lenders and the addition of new lenders, this arrangement was primarily accounted for as a modification of debt and, as such, $6.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with the 2030 New Term Loan were expensed. The aggregate balance of approximately $4.4 million of debt issuance costs and approximately $2.2 million of original discount from the 2025 Term Loan and 2030 Term Loan, $0.1 million of debt issuance costs associated with new lenders for the 2030 New Term Loan, and approximately $2.9 million of original discount from the 2030 New Term Loan, were included in the carrying value of the 2030 New Term Loan.\nThe Amendment amends the Credit Agreement and provides that the 2030 New Term Loan will, among other things:\nmature on October 24, 2030;\namortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate amounts equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the 2030 New Term Loan as of January 19, 2023, or $2.9 million, or $11.7 million annually, with the balance payable at maturity;\nbe subject to mandatory prepayment upon the occurrence of certain specified events substantially similar to the Refinanced Term Loans, including upon the occurrence of certain specified events such as asset sales, debt issuances, and receipt of annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement);\nbear interest, at Cienas election, at a per annum rate equal to (a) SOFR (subject to a floor of 0.00%) plus an applicable margin of 2.00%, or (b) a base rate (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of 1.00%; and\nbe repayable at any time at Cienas election, provided that repayment of the 2030 New Term Loan with proceeds of certain indebtedness prior to April 24, 2024 will require a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of such prepayment.\nAmong other things, the Amendment also amends the Credit Agreement by (i) modifying the accordion feature to provide for incremental term loan facilities (the Incremental Term Loans) in an aggregate amount not to exceed the sum of (A) the greater of (1) $640 million and (2) an amount equal to consolidated EBITDA on a pro forma basis for the most recently ended four-quarter period and (B) an amount (1) in the case of secured incremental term facilities that rank pari passu with or junior to the 2030 New Term Loan, such that the Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) would not be greater than 3.00 to 1.00 at the time of incurrence and (2) in the case of unsecured incremental term facilities, such that the Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) would not be less than 2.00 to 1.00 at the time of incurrence, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from any one or more lenders, whether or not currently party to the Credit Agreement, to provide such increased amounts and (ii) amending certain negative covenants.\nThe net carrying value of the 2030 New Term Loan was comprised of the following as of the date indicated (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023\nPrincipal Balance Unamortized Discount Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Net Carrying Value\n2030 New Term Loan $ 1,170,000 $ (5,122) $ (5,507) $ 1,159,371\nDeferred debt issuance costs that were deducted from the carrying amount of the 2030 New Term Loan totaled $5.5 million as of October 28, 2023. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effect of the effective interest rate, through the maturity of the 2030 New Term Loan. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs for the 2030 New Term Loan is included in interest expense, and was $0.1 million during fiscal 2023.\nAs of October 28, 2023, the estimated fair value of the 2030 New Term Loan was $1.2 billion. The 2030 New Term Loan is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Ciena estimated the fair value of its 2030 New Term Loan using a market approach based on observable inputs, such as current market transactions involving comparable securities.\nRefinanced Term Loans\nThe proceeds of the 2030 New Term Loan, net of original issuance discount, was used to repay in full $1.2 billion of outstanding principal of the Refinanced Term Loans, including accrued interest.\n2025 Term Loan\nOn January 19, 2023, in connection with the Incremental Agreement (as defined below) to the Credit Agreement (as defined below), the Credit Agreement was amended to replace LIBOR with SOFR for the 2025 Term Loan in response to pending impact of FASB Accounting Standards Codification 848, Reference Rate Reform. The net carrying value of the 2025 Term Loan as of October 29, 2022 was $673.0 million. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effect of the effective interest rate method, through the maturity of the 2025 Term Loan. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs for the 2025 Term Loan is included in interest expense, and was $0.6 million for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.\n2030 Term Loan\nOn January 19, 2023, Ciena entered into an Incremental Joinder and Amendment Agreement (the Incremental Agreement) to its Credit Agreement, dated July 15, 2014, as amended, by and among Ciena, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, pursuant to which Ciena incurred a new tranche of senior secured term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $500.0 million and maturing on January 19, 2030 (the 2030 Term Loan). Net of original issue discount and debt issuance costs, the $492.5 million in proceeds from the 2030 Term Loan were intended to be used for general corporate purposes.\nThe Incremental Agreement amended the Credit Agreement and provided that the 2030 Term Loan would, among other things:\nmature on January 19, 2030;\namortize in equal quarterly installments in aggregate amounts equal to 0.25% of the principal amount of the 2030 Term Loan as of January 19, 2023, or $1.25 million, with the balance payable at maturity;\nbe subject to mandatory prepayment on the same basis as the 2025 Term Loan, including on the occurrence of certain specified events such as asset sales, debt issuances, and receipt of annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement);\nbear interest, at Cienas election, at a per annum rate equal to (a) SOFR (subject to a floor of 0.00%) plus an applicable margin of 2.50%, or (b) a base rate (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin of 1.50%; and\nbe repayable at any time at Cienas election, provided that repayment of the 2030 Term Loan with proceeds of certain indebtedness prior to July 19, 2023 will require a prepayment premium of 1.00% of the aggregate principal amount of such prepayment.\nExcept as amended by the Incremental Agreement, the remaining terms of the Credit Agreement remained in full force and effect.\nDeferred debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effect of the effective interest rate, through the maturity of the 2030 Term Loan. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs for the 2030 Term Loan is included in interest expense and was $0.5 million for fiscal 2023.\n2030 Notes\nOn January 18, 2022, Ciena entered into an Indenture (the Indenture) among Ciena, as issuer, certain domestic subsidiaries of Ciena, as guarantors (collectively, the Guarantors), and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the Trustee), pursuant to which Ciena issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due 2030 (the 2030 Notes).\nThe net carrying value of the 2030 Notes was comprised of the following for the period indicated (in thousands):\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022\nPrincipal Balance Deferred Debt Issuance Costs Net Carrying Value Net Carrying Value\n2030 Senior Notes 4.00% fixed-rate\n$ 400,000 $ (4,265) $ 395,735 $ 395,045\nDeferred debt issuance costs that were deducted from the carrying amount of the 2030 Notes totaled $4.3 million as of October 28, 2023 and $5.0 million as of October 29, 2022. Deferred debt issuance costs are amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effect of the effective interest rate, through the maturity of the 2030 Notes. The amortization of deferred debt issuance costs for the 2030 Notes is included in interest expense, and was $0.7 million during fiscal 2023 and $0.5 million during fiscal 2022.\nAs of October 28, 2023, the estimated fair value of the 2030 Notes was $330.5 million. The 2030 Notes are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Ciena estimated the fair value of its 2030 Notes using a market approach based on observable inputs, such as current market transactions involving comparable securities.\n(20) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY\nOn February 10, 2023, pursuant to an ABL Credit Agreement dated October 28, 2019, as amended (the ABL Credit Agreement), by and among Ciena, certain of its subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto (the ABL Lenders), and Bank of America, as administrative agent, Ciena modified its senior secured asset-backed revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility), which provided for a total commitment of $300.0 million to extend its maturity date to September 28, 2025.\nOn October 24, 2023 (the Closing Date), pursuant to the Incremental Amendment Agreement to the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 19 above), Ciena incurred a new senior secured revolving credit facility of $300.0 million (the Revolving Credit Facility), which replaced the ABL Credit Facility. Ciena has the option to increase the total revolving commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility to $450.0 million, subject to certain conditions, including obtaining commitments from one or more lenders. The Credit Agreement provides that $200.0 million of the Revolving Credit Facility is available for issuances\nof letters of credit and allows for swingline loans in an amount not to exceed $50.0 million. On or about the Closing Date, Ciena transferred to the Revolving Credit Facility certain outstanding letters of credit initially issued under the ABL Credit Facility with an undrawn amount of approximately $65.1 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility as of the Closing Date. Ciena expects to use the Revolving Credit Facility to support the issuance of letters of credit that arise in the ordinary course of its business and for general corporate purposes.\nThe Credit Agreement provides that the Revolving Credit Facility will, among other things:\nmature on October 24, 2028;\nbear interest on outstanding borrowings, at Cienas election, at a per annum rate equal to (a) SOFR (subject to a floor of 0.00%) plus a credit spread adjustment of 0.10% plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.375% to 2.00%, or (b) a base rate (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.375% to 1.00%, in each case, with the actual margin determined according to the Total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement above);\nhave a commitment fee payable on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at a per annum rate ranging from 0.225% to 0.300%, with the actual rate determined according to the Total Net Leverage Ratio; and\ninclude a restriction on the aggregate amount of Incremental Term Loans and certain other indebtedness that can be incurred in the future equal to an amount that would not result in the Total Net Leverage Ratio exceeding 5.00 to 1.00 at the time of incurrence.\nThe obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by all of Cienas subsidiaries that currently, or in the future are required to, guarantee the obligations of the 2030 New Term Loan, including, as of the Closing Date, Ciena Communications, Inc., Ciena Government Solutions, Inc., Ciena Communications International, LLC and Blue Planet Software, Inc., and are secured on a pari passu basis with the 2030 New Term Loan by a pledge of substantially all of the assets of Ciena and the guarantors. Upon the occurrence of certain events related to the improvement of Cienas credit rating and repayment of all secured term loans (Investment Grade Events), all collateral securing the obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility will be released at Cienas election.\nUnder the Revolving Credit Facility, Ciena is also required to maintain certain financial maintenance covenants, including:\nprior to an Investment Grade Event, a maximum Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio of no greater than 3.50 to 1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters (provided, that in the event Ciena consummates a qualifying acquisition, Ciena can elect to increase the maximum Total Secured Net Leverage Ratio level to 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which such qualifying acquisition is consummated and for the next five consecutive fiscal quarters);\non or after an Investment Grade Event, a maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio of no greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters; and\na minimum Interest Coverage Ratio of no less than 3.00 to 1.00 as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters.\nExcept as amended by the Amendment, the remaining terms of the Credit Agreement remain in full force and effect.\nAs of October 28, 2023, Ciena was in compliance with the above financial maintenance covenants. As of October 28, 2023, letters of credit totaling $72.5 million were issued under our Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of October 28, 2023.\n(21) EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION\nBasic net income per common share (Basic EPS) is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income per potential common share (Diluted EPS) is computed using the weighted average number of the following, in each case, to the extent the effect is not anti-dilutive: (i) common shares outstanding, (ii) shares issuable upon vesting of stock unit awards; and (iii) shares issuable under Cienas employee stock purchase plan and upon exercise of outstanding stock options, using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table presents the calculation of Basic and Diluted EPS (in thousands except per share amounts):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nNet income $ 254,827 $ 152,902 $ 500,196\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding 148,971 151,208 155,279\nEffect of dilutive potential common shares 409 985 1,464\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 149,380 152,193 156,743\nBasic EPS $ 1.71 $ 1.01 $ 3.22\nDiluted EPS $ 1.71 $ 1.00 $ 3.19\nAntidilutive employee share-based awards, excluded 2,675 1,370 110\n(22) STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nStock Repurchase Program and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreement\nOn December 13, 2018, Ciena announced that its Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Cienas common stock. During fiscal 2021, Ciena repurchased 1.7 million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $92.1 million at an average price of $54.27 per share. Under this program, Ciena repurchased a total of 7.4 million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $316.7 million at an average price of $42.75 per share.\nOn December 9, 2021, Ciena announced that its Board of Directors replaced its previously authorized program, as described above, with a program to repurchase up to $1.0 billion of its common stock. On December 13, 2021, Ciena entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the ASR Agreement) with Goldman, Sachs & Co. LLC (Goldman) to repurchase $250.0 million (the Repurchase Price) of its common stock as part of the repurchase program. Under the terms of the ASR Agreement, Ciena paid the Repurchase Price to Goldman, and received approximately 3.6 million shares of its common stock from Goldman, calculated based on the average of the volume-weighted average prices of Cienas common stock of $69.78 for the period from December 14, 2021 to February 11, 2022, less a discount, which completed the repurchases contemplated by the ASR Agreement. Shares repurchased pursuant to the ASR Agreement were immediately retired upon receipt. During the remainder of fiscal 2022, Ciena repurchased an additional 4.8 million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million at an average price of $51.53 per share.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Ciena repurchased an additional 5.7 million shares of its common stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $250.0 million at an average price of $44.08 per share. As of October 28, 2023, Ciena has repurchased an aggregate of 14.1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $750.0 million at an average price of $53.17 per share and has an aggregate of $250.0 million of authorized funds remaining under its stock repurchase program.\nThe purchase price for the shares of Cienas stock repurchased is reflected as a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.\nImpact of Inflation Reduction Act 1% Excise Tax on Share Repurchases\nBeginning fiscal 2023, a 1% excise tax on the market value of shares repurchased offset by 1% of the market value of shares issued was implemented. During fiscal 2023, a net excise tax of $1.5 million was recorded to additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStock Repurchases Related to Restricted Stock Unit Tax Withholdings\nCiena repurchases shares of common stock to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations due upon vesting of stock unit awards. The related purchase price of $38.5 million for the shares of Cienas stock repurchased during fiscal 2023 is reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity. Ciena is required to allocate the purchase price of the repurchased shares as a reduction of common stock and additional paid-in capital.\n(23) INCOME TAXES\nFor the periods indicated, the provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes:\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 36,537 $ 27,479 $ 72,603\nState 18,860 10,289 21,400\nForeign 28,281 19,337 25,021\nTotal current 83,678 57,105 119,024\nDeferred:\nFederal (8,010) (30,032) (21,942)\nState (17,354) 520 (11,546)\nForeign 10,512 2,010 (122,981)\nTotal deferred (14,852) (27,502) (156,469)\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes $ 68,826 $ 29,603 $ (37,445)\nFor the periods indicated, income before provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nUnited States $ 93,682 $ 28,784 $ 298,514\nForeign 229,971 153,721 164,237\nTotal $ 323,653 $ 182,505 $ 462,751\nCienas foreign income tax as a percentage of foreign income may appear disproportionate compared to the expected tax based on the U.S. federal statutory rate and is dependent on the mix of earnings and tax rates in foreign jurisdictions.\nFor the periods indicated, the tax provision reconciles to the amount computed by multiplying income before income taxes by the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 as follows:\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nProvision at statutory rate 21.00 % 21.00 % 21.00 %\nIntercompany IP Restructuring Transaction - % - % (25.85) %\nState taxes 1.65 % 2.31 % 3.73 %\nWithholding and other foreign taxes (0.09) % (1.37) % 2.76 %\nResearch and development credit (16.78) % (23.66) % (7.99) %\nNon-deductible compensation 5.29 % 5.26 % 1.68 %\nForeign derived intangible income - % - % (1.82) %\nUS Taxation on foreign activity 5.08 % 1.73 % - %\nForeign Nontaxable interest (1.06) % (1.90) % - %\nTaxation on foreign inflation 1.34 % 1.41 % 0.16 %\nRate change (3.71) % 1.27 % (4.33) %\nValuation allowance 9.44 % 8.35 % 1.77 %\nLoss on equity transactions (1.72) % - % - %\nUncertain tax positions 1.72 % 1.62 % 0.63 %\nOther (0.89) % 0.20 % 0.17 %\nEffective income tax rate 21.27 % 16.22 % (8.09) %\nOur future income tax provisions and deferred tax balances may be affected by the amount of pre-tax income, the jurisdictions where it is earned, the existence and ability to utilize tax attributes and changes in tax laws and business reorganizations.\nIn fiscal 2021, Ciena began implementation of a plan to reorganize its global supply chain and distribution structure more substantially, which included a legal entity reorganization and related system upgrade. Ciena completed the first phase of this plan in fiscal 2021, and substantially completed the reorganization during fiscal 2022. As part of this reorganization, Ciena completed an internal transfer of certain of its non-U.S. intangible assets, which created amortizable tax basis resulting in the discrete recognition of a $119.3 million deferred tax asset with a corresponding tax benefit. The impact of this transfer is reflected in Cienas effective tax rate for the year ended October 30, 2021, which had a significant, one-time impact on its net income for the period.\nCiena is also required to make accounting policy elections as a result of the Tax Act. These include whether a valuation allowance is recorded for the estimated effect of the application of GILTI and BEAT or if these will be treated as period costs when incurred. Ciena had made the incremental cash tax cost policy election with respect to analyzing the impact of GILTI on the assessment of the realizability of net operating losses. The realizability of U.S. tax carryforwards is not impacted by the BEAT, and the BEAT is a period cost when incurred. Ciena is also required to elect to treat taxes due on future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income either as a current period expense when incurred or reflect such portion of the future GILTI inclusions in U.S. taxable income that relate to existing basis differences in Cienas current measurement of deferred taxes. Cienas accounting policy election is to treat the taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income under GILTI as a period cost when incurred.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nReserves and accrued liabilities $ 82,160 $ 76,839\nDepreciation and amortization 712,098 690,636\nNOL and credit carry forward 197,984 154,707\nOther 6,934 63,902\nGross deferred tax assets 999,176 986,084\nValuation allowance (189,870) (162,076)\nDeferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance $ 809,306 $ 824,008\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in thousands):\nAmount\nUnrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2020 $ 95,748\nDecrease related to positions taken in prior period (22,854)\nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities (654)\nIncrease related to positions taken in current period 5,510\nReductions related to expiration of statute of limitations (659)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at October 30, 2021 77,091\nIncrease related to positions taken in prior period 4,732\nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities (3,229)\nIncrease related to positions taken in current period 2,959\nReductions related to expiration of statute of limitations (1,039)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at October 29, 2022 80,514\nIncrease related to positions taken in prior period 9,940\nReductions related to settlements with taxing authorities (625)\nIncrease related to positions taken in current period 4,960\nReductions related to expiration of statute of limitations (869)\nUnrecognized tax benefits at October 28, 2023 $ 93,920\nAs of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, Ciena had accrued $7.9 million and $5.2 million of interest and penalties, respectively, related to unrecognized tax benefits included in other long-term obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties of $2.7 million and $1.7 million were recorded as a net expense to the provision for income taxes during fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. During fiscal 2021, Ciena recorded a net benefit to the provision for interest and penalties in its provision for income taxes of $0.1 million. If recognized, the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits would impact the effective tax rate. Over the next 12 months, Ciena does not estimate any material changes in unrecognized income tax benefits.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, Ciena evaluated the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries and identified approximately $222.0 million in earnings that are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Ciena recorded a provision of $2.5 million that reflects the income tax effects of the repatriation of these earnings. No additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference from investments in the foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested. If the remaining undistributed foreign earnings and profits of $381.0 million were repatriated to the U.S., the provisional amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability, which is primarily related to foreign withholding taxes, is an estimated $30.0 million; however, the amount may be lower depending on Cienas ability to utilize tax credits associated with the distribution. Additionally, there are no other significant temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability or asset has not been recognized.\nAs of October 28, 2023, Ciena continues to maintain a valuation allowance of $189.9 million against its gross deferred tax assets primarily. The valuation allowance is primarily related to state and foreign net operating losses and credits that Ciena estimates it will not be able to use.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in Cienas valuation allowance against its gross deferred tax assets (in thousands):\nYear Ended Beginning Balance Additions Deductions Ending Balance\nOctober 30, 2021 $ 151,427 $ 17,897 $ 9,690 $ 159,634\nOctober 29, 2022 $ 159,634 $ 15,245 $ 12,803 $ 162,076\nOctober 28, 2023 $ 162,076 $ 28,746 $ 952 $ 189,870\n(24) SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nCiena has outstanding equity awards issued under its 2017 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan), its 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan, and certain legacy equity plans and equity plans assumed as a result of previous acquisitions. All equity awards granted on or after March 23, 2017 are made exclusively from the 2017 Plan. Ciena also makes shares of its common stock available for purchase under the ESPP. Each of the 2017 Plan and the ESPP are described below.\n2017 Plan\nThe 2017 Plan has a ten-year term and authorizes the issuance of awards including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), restricted stock, unrestricted stock, stock appreciation rights (SARs) and other equity and/or cash performance incentive awards to employees, directors and consultants of Ciena. Subject to certain restrictions, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors has broad discretion to establish the terms and conditions for awards under the 2017 Plan, including the number of shares, vesting conditions, and the required service or performance criteria. Options and SARs have a maximum term of ten years, and their exercise price may not be less than 100% of fair market value on the date of grant. Repricing of stock options and SARs is prohibited without stockholder approval. Certain change in control transactions may cause awards granted under the 2017 Plan to vest, unless the awards are continued or substituted for in connection with the transaction.\nThe 2017 Plan authorizes and reserves 21.1 million shares for issuance. The number of shares available under the 2017 Plan are also increased from time to time by: (i) the number of shares subject to outstanding awards granted under Cienas prior equity compensation plans that are forfeited, expire or are canceled without delivery of common stock following the effective date of the 2017 Plan, and (ii) the number of shares subject to awards assumed or substituted in connection with the acquisition of another company. As of October 28, 2023, the total number of shares authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan was 21.1 million and approximately 5.6 million shares remained available for issuance thereunder.\nStock Options\nThere were no stock options granted by Ciena during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. Outstanding stock option awards granted to employees in prior periods are generally subject to service-based vesting conditions and vest over a four-year period. The following table is a summary of Cienas stock option activity for the periods indicated (shares in thousands):\nShares\nUnderlying\nOptions\nOutstanding Weighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nBalance at October 29, 2022 32 $ 30.98\nGranted - -\nExercised (22) $ 33.98\nCanceled (3) $ 45.32\nBalance at October 28, 2023 7 $ 16.94\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $0.3 million, $1.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes information with respect to stock options outstanding at October 28, 2023, based on Cienas closing stock price on the last trading day of Cienas fiscal 2023 (shares and intrinsic value in thousands):\nOptions Outstanding and Vested at\nOctober 28, 2023\nNumber Weighted\nAverage\nRemaining Weighted\nRange of of Contractual Average Aggregate\nExercise Underlying Life Exercise Intrinsic\nPrice Shares (Years) Price Value\n$ 14.38 - $ 18.22 7 0.36 $ 16.94 $ 178\nAssumptions for Option-Based Awards\nCiena recognizes the fair value of stock options as share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Ciena did not grant any option-based awards during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA restricted stock unit is a stock award that entitles the holder to receive shares of Ciena common stock as the unit vests. Cienas outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service-based vesting conditions and/or performance-based vesting conditions. Awards subject to service-based conditions typically vest in increments over a three or four-year period.\nHowever, the 2017 Plan permits Ciena to grant service-based stock awards with a minimum one-year vesting period. Awards with performance-based vesting conditions (i) require the achievement of certain operational, financial or other performance criteria or targets or (ii) vest based on Cienas total stockholder return as compared to an index of peer companies, in whole or in part.\nDuring fiscal 2023, Ciena introduced a benefit pursuant to which, upon completion of ten years of service and reaching age 60, executive officers who are residents of the United States, the United Kingdom, or Canada and who provide 12 months notice of their retirement will receive continued vesting of all of their granted but unvested restricted stock unit (RSU) awards and a pro-rated amount of their performance stock unit awards and market stock unit awards. Other employees in these countries will be subject to the same eligibility and notice requirements, but will receive acceleration of their granted but unvested RSU awards upon retirement. This program accelerates the recognition of share-based compensation expense.\nAssumptions for Restricted Stock Unit Awards\nCiena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject only to service-based vesting conditions by multiplying the number of shares underlying the award by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. Share-based expense for service-based restricted stock unit awards is recognized ratably over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nCiena recognizes the estimated fair value of restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions other than total stockholder return, by assuming the satisfaction of any performance-based objectives at the target level and multiplying the corresponding number of shares earned based upon such achievement by the closing price per share of Ciena common stock on the grant date. Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the performance period, using graded vesting, which considers each performance period or tranche separately, based on Cienas determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. At the end of each reporting period, Ciena reassesses the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment. Revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed. If any performance goals are not met, no compensation cost is ultimately recognized against that goal and, to the extent previously recognized, compensation expense is reversed.\nShare-based compensation expense for restricted stock units subject only to service-based vesting conditions and restricted stock units subject to performance-based vesting conditions other than total stockholder return, is recognized only for those awards that ultimately vest. In the event of a forfeiture of an award, the expense related to the unvested portion of that award is reversed. Reversal of share-based compensation expense based on forfeitures can materially affect the measurement of estimated fair value of Cienas share-based compensation.\nCiena recognizes the estimated fair value of performance based awards subject to total stockholder return as compared to an index of peer companies using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. Ciena reverses share-based compensation expense on performance based awards subject to total shareholder return only when the requisite service period is not reached. Assumptions for awards granted during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 included the following:\nYear Ended\nOctober 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 October 30, 2021\nExpected volatility of Ciena common stock, which is a weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 40.37% 38.27% 41.00%\nHistorical volatility of Ciena common stock\n43.11% 42.17% 42.80%\nHistorical volatility of S&P Networking Index 30.93% 27.22% 27.30%\nCorrelation coefficient\n0.7781 0.7049 0.6800\nExpected life in years 2.89 2.89 2.87\nRisk-free interest rate 3.95% 0.94% 0.17%\nExpected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0%\nThe following table is a summary of Cienas restricted stock unit activity for the period indicated, with the aggregate fair value of the balance outstanding at the end of each period, based on Cienas closing stock price on the last trading day of the relevant period (shares and aggregate fair value in thousands):\nRestricted\nStock Units\nOutstanding Weighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nPer Share Aggregate Fair\nValue\nBalance at October 29, 2022 4,103 $ 55.16 $ 197,960\nGranted 3,301\nVested (2,067)\nCanceled or forfeited (415)\nBalance at October 28, 2023 4,922 $ 53.42 $ 201,916\nAs of October 28, 2023 and October 29, 2022, 0.3 million of the total restricted stock units outstanding are performance based awards subject to total stockholder return. The total fair value of restricted stock units that vested and were converted into common stock during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $98.2 million, $119.0 million and $110.0 million, respectively. The weighted average fair value of each restricted stock unit granted by Ciena during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $50.48, $67.03 and $48.70, respectively.\nAmended and Restated ESPP\nCiena makes shares of its common stock available for purchase under the ESPP, under which eligible employees may enroll in a twelve-month offer period that begins in December and June of each year. Each offer period includes two six-month purchase periods. Employees may purchase a limited number of shares of Ciena common stock at 85% of the fair market value on either the day immediately preceding the offer date or the purchase date, whichever is lower.

Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of Ciena Corporation;\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America;\nprovide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures of Ciena Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of Ciena Corporation; and\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nManagement of Ciena Corporation assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of October 28, 2023. Management based this assessment on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in COSO 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
