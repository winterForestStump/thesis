In the process of globalization layout, the first phase will promote the brand in a more diversified form, focusing on the global business perspective, extending to Asian and European markets in the next three years, and then opening a global market service system.\nFranchising Policies\nThe franchising policy mainly includes four aspects:\n1. Regional Partner Policy; where regional agents need to have industry network resources, marketing team, and be able to interlock parking lots and ecosystem businesses, with a deposit of 100,000 yuan. There will be parking lot interlock incentives, merchant interlock incentives, user promotion incentives and regional market incentives.\n2.

At present, the average utilization rate of parking spaces in China is about 40%, the larger the scale of the parking lot, the lower the utilization rate, such as the largest commercial complex parking lot, but the average daily utilization rate is only 37%, which is lower than the average level of other types of parking lots. Over 90% of cities in China have an overall parking utilization rate of less than 50%, and the parking utilization rate in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou is in the range of 40-50%, which is a waste of parking resources.\nUnder the traditional parking space management system, the degree of specialization in parking management is low, the industry is highly fragmented, and there is a lack of large specialized parking management companies. There are many types of market participants with different standards, the uneven level of control prevents the centralized management of traditional parking spaces, which further hinders the effective use of parking spaces and is not conducive to the improvement of parking space utilization.\nIn Beijing, there are 6,581 registered parking lots, but more than 3,000 property management companies and parking lot management companies are involved in management. The market share of parking spaces of the top four management companies only accounts for 8.5%; the market share of the top-ranked parking management company is 4.4%, and the market share of parking spaces is only 1.9%. At the same time, Chinas traditional parking management system has a low level of intelligence and management method.\nAccording to Sullivans data, the coverage rate of intelligent parking lots in major cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen is less than 10%, and most domestic parking lots still adopt the traditional card and ticket entrance/exit management method, with manual charging as the main method. The backward management method leads to the problems of slow access, difficulty in finding parking space and difficulty in finding a car. The length of time and difficulty for car owners to find cars increases with the scale of the car park.\nFor example, the parking lot of commercial complex is generally large in scale and complex in structure, and the users search time is often 4-6 times of the average search time of other types of parking lots (residential, commercial office buildings, transportation hubs, etc.). The backward management method greatly lengthens the time of occupied parking spaces, hinders the improvement of parking space turnover rate, and even directly causes poor user parking experience.\nWith the problem of difficult parking becoming more and more prominent, the commercial and social value of the smart parking industry has also become more and more prominent. Smart parking management mode can effectively improve the utilization of parking resources, thus alleviating the problem of urban parking difficulties. It is sought after by all social forces (capital, policy, technology, users, etc.) and can promote the further development of the industry.\nChinas smart parking industry has not yet issued a national unified construction standard, the construction of parking information systems in local cities across the country lacks a unified normative basis, and the smart parking systems built by various office buildings, hotels, shopping malls, and communities lack integrated planning and architecture specifications, especially for applications in commercial areas and communities, with significant differences in architecture between systems, leading to difficulties in information exchange and system integration. There are a large number of smart parking enterprises and derivatives on the market, each smart parking products and service providers is on their own, the products and systems launched are not compatible with each other. In the smart parking application field, the market is not yet standardized nationwide via a single parking app, all parking apps information is not incorporated or shared, forming many singled out information islands, which is against the original intention of revitalizing the market of smart parking. These apps also have different user experiences, which brings a lot of inconvenience to consumers, and eventually abandoned by many of them, which is not beneficial to the expansion and popularity of smart parking network.\nIn addition, the development of the industry is not standardized, there are some providers who do not have the resources to research, develop and provide post-sale services, who end up reducing prices to sell low-quality products. No real competing power, disrupting the market order, causing quality manufacturers a certain amount of competitive pressure, intensifying a degree of competition in the industry, which is not favorable to a healthy development of the industry.\nIn the past three years, internet companies have entered the smart parking industry in a big way with capital. in February 2018, Ant Group under Alibaba took a 200-million-yuan stake in J-Parking. In August of the same year, Tencent made a strategic investment in Xiamen Ketuo Co.\nInternet companies have combined their advantages in artificial intelligence, mobile payment and other technologies with smart parking platforms for strategic cooperation. This strategic cooperation between internet companies and smart parking platforms has made unattended and sensor less payment the trend of industry development. The mainstream smart parking operation platform has access to Alipay, WeChat payment and other mobile payment technologies. In May 2018, Baidu and ETCP reached a strategic cooperation, through the parking payment page of Baidu Map or the ETCP Parking APP, car owners can check parking information in real time, navigate to the parking lot, and enjoy smart parking services such as electronic payment for entering and exiting the parking lot without parking, achieving a harmonious system of shared data and integrated platform.\nBaidu, Ali, Tencent and other Internet giants have entered the game one after another, not only to provide a solid financial basis for the transformation of parking services, also the integration of on-line operations and smart parking, which boosts rapid and steady development of the industry, driving the industry into a new stage of development. As the head enterprises in the smart parking industry accelerate their capital operation, the industry will accelerate the pace of high-quality parking resources, and will also surge a wave of mergers and acquisitions, resulting industry integration to be further accelerated.\nAccording to some developed countries, the ratio of car to parking spaces is 1:1.3, while the average in China is less than 1:0.5, which is a serious imbalance between supply and demand, car owners and drivers usually cannot find a parking space after driving out to the destination, due to the difficulty of finding parking spaces leading to unlawful parking, road congestion, traffic accidents and other problems, bringing concerns to the governments urban traffic.\nAnalysis from the perspective of the needs of car owners and drivers: This part of the user demand we call C-end user demand, its demand for parking is extremely urgent and rigid, they hope to be able to check the availability of parking spaces near the destination in advance before leaving home, you can reserve a parking space in advance. At the same time, as car owners and drivers, they hope that the platform can provide them with more user-friendly, more detailed and comprehensive services and better experience.\nAnalysis from the perspective of different parking space owners and operators: They want to realize unattended and automated payments; they want to reduce operating costs and improve operational efficiency; they want to realize intelligent and digital management and turn their resources into their digital assets.\nAnalysis from the perspective of city planners: They want to have a software, a system and a platform to integrate the parking spaces of different property rights in the whole city, to achieve data integration and sharing, and to realize real-time data update, query, regulation and scheduling.\nAnalysis from the perspective of the state, to promote the industry and industrial development: The smart parking industry covers a wide range, long industry chain, the state hopes to have a comprehensive digital, industry-wide platform for industry resource integration and information sharing, in order to promote the development of the whole industry.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe that Intellegence has significant advantages in terms of development strategy, technology, team, business model and capital operation.

These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Companys financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.\nContractual Obligations\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our condensed financial statements.\nWhile we believe that the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material\nImpact of Inflation\nIn accordance with the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the year-over-year percentage changes in the consumer price index for March 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 were 2.3%, 4.3%, 4.4% and 2%, respectively. Inflation in China has not materially affected our profitability and operating results. However, we can provide no assurance that we will be unaffected by higher inflation rates in China in the future.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe are not materially affected by foreign currency exchange rates. However, it is difficult to predict how market forces, or PRC or U.S. government policy, might affect our operations. There remains significant international pressure on the PRC government to adopt a substantial liberalization of its currency policy, which could result in a further and more significant change in the value of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. Limited hedging transactions are available in China to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations. So far, we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we potentially may decide to enter into hedging transactions in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited, and we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure at all. Furthermore, our currency exchange losses may be magnified by PRC exchange control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo:\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of\nSavMobi Technology Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of SavMobi Technology Inc. (the Company) as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss), changes in equity, and cash flow for year ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, and the result of its operations and its cash flow for the year then ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nExplanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company had incurred substantial losses during the year, and has a working capital deficit, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plan in regards to these matters are described in Note 3. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\n1. The Company conducted transactions with its related parties and affiliates during the normal course of its business in 2023. The Company has entered into a number of transactions with these related parties, including director remuneration which represented as costs and expenses to the Company. We identified the evaluation of the identification of related parties and related party transactions as a critical audit matter. Auditor judgment was involved in assessing the sufficiency of the procedures performed to identify related parties and related party transactions of the Company.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nWe performed the following procedures to evaluate the identification of related parties and related party transactions by the Company:\n\u25cf Conducted background checks, and reviewed other public research sources for information related to transactions between the Company and its related parties\n\u25cf Performed confirmations for account balances with related parties\n\u25cf Reviewed transaction details in the accounts payable system for transactions with related parties\n\u25cf Examined the Companys reconciliation of its related parties transactions and balances\n\u25cf Tested expenses transactions between the Company and its related parties\n2. As described in Note 3, for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported accumulated deficit of $23,887,645 and $18,433,688 and a working capital deficiency/(equity) of $784,107 and ($3,609,189), respectively. The Companys operations are mainly funded with debt financing, which is dependent upon many external factors and may be difficult to raise when required. The Company may not have sufficient cash to fund its operations, and therefore, will require additional funding, which if not raised, may result in the delay, postponement or curtailment of some or all of its activities. Management has prepared future cash flow forecasts, which involves judgement and estimation of key variables, such as planned expenditures, future financings and market conditions.\nWe identified the Companys ability to continue as a going concern as a critical audit matter because auditing the Companys going concern assessment is complex and involves a high degree of auditor judgment to assess the reasonableness of the cash flow forecasts, planned refinancing actions and other assumptions used in the Companys going concern analysis. The Companys ability to execute the planned refinancing actions are especially judgmental given that the global financial markets.\nThis matter is also described in the Explanatory Paragraph Regarding Going Concern section of our report.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nWe responded to this matter by performing procedures over managements assessment of the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

Contractual agreements with VIEs\nPower of Attorney\nPursuant to the power of attorney agreements among the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprises (WFOEs), the VIEs and their respective Nominee Shareholders, each Nominee Shareholder of the VIEs irrevocably undertakes to appoint the WFOE, as the attorney-in-fact to exercise all of the rights as a shareholder of the VIEs, including, but not limited to, the right to convene and attend shareholders meeting, vote on any resolution that requires a shareholder vote, such as appoint or remove directors and other senior management, and other voting rights pursuant to the articles of association (subject to the amendments) of the VIEs. Each power of attorney agreement is irrevocable and remains in effect as long as the Nominee Shareholder continues to be a shareholder of the VIEs. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, none of the VIEs or its shareholders can unilaterally terminate this agreement.\nExclusive Option Agreements\nPursuant to the exclusive option agreements among WFOEs, the VIEs and their respective Nominee Shareholders, the Nominee Shareholders granted WFOEs exclusive right to purchase, when and to the extent permitted under PRC law, all or part of the equity interests from shareholders of VIEs. The exercise price for the options to purchase all or part of the equity interests shall be the minimum amount of consideration permissible under then applicable PRC law. The agreement shall be valid until WFOEs or its designated party purchases all the shares from shareholders of VIEs. The terms of the exclusive option agreement are 10 years and can be automatically extended until such time WFOEs delivers a confirmation letter specifying the renewal term of this agreement. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, the VIEs or its shareholders shall not unilaterally terminate this agreement.\nExclusive Business Corporation Agreement\nPursuant to the exclusive business cooperation agreements among the WFOEs and the VIEs, respectively, the WFOEs have the exclusive right to provide the VIEs with services related to, among other things, comprehensive technical support, professional training, consulting services, trademark and copyright of system,. Without prior written consent of the WFOEs, the VIEs agree not to directly or indirectly accept the same or any similar services provided by any others regarding the matters ascribed by the exclusive business cooperation agreements. The VIEs agree to pay the WFOEs services fees, which shall be determined by the WFOEs. The WFOEs have the exclusive ownership of intellectual property rights created as a result of the performance of the agreements. The agreements shall remain effective except that the WFOEs are entitled to terminate the agreements in writing. Unless otherwise required by PRC Laws, the VIEs shall not unilaterally terminate this agreement.\nEquity Pledge Agreement\nPursuant to the equity pledge agreements among the WFOEs, the VIEs and their respective Nominee Shareholders, the Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs pledged all of their respective equity interests in the VIEs to the WFOEs as collaterals for performance of the obligations of the VIEs and their Nominee Shareholders under the exclusive business cooperation agreements, the power of attorney agreements, and the exclusive option agreements. The Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs also undertake that, during the term of the equity pledge agreements, unless otherwise approved by the WFOEs in writing, they will not transfer the pledged equity interests or create or allow any new pledge or other encumbrance on the pledged equity interests. These equity pledge agreements remain in force until VIEs and their respective Nominee Shareholders discharge all their obligations under the contractual agreements.\nSpousal Consent Letter\nPursuant to the spousal consent letters, the spouses of some of the individual Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs unconditionally and irrevocably agree that the equity interest in the VIEs held by and registered in the name of his or her respective spouse will be disposed of pursuant to the relevant exclusive business cooperation agreements, equity pledge agreements, the exclusive option agreements and the power of attorney agreements, without his or her consent. In addition, each of them agrees not to assert any rights over the equity interest in the VIEs held by their respective spouses. In addition, in the event that any of them obtains any equity interest in the VIEs held by their respective spouses for any reason, such spouses agree to be bound by similar obligations and agreed to enter into similar contractual arrangements.\nb. Risks in relation to the VIE structure\nOn March 15, 2019, the National Peoples Congress adopted the Foreign Investment Law of the PRC, which became effective on January 1, 2020, together with their implementation rules and ancillary regulations. The Foreign Investment Law does not explicitly classify contractual arrangements as a form of foreign investment, but it contains a catch-all provision under the definition of foreign investment, which includes investments made by foreign investors through means stipulated in laws or administrative regulations or other methods prescribed by the State Council. It is unclear whether the Groups corporate structure will be seen as violating the foreign investment rules as the Group is currently leveraging the contractual arrangements to operate certain business in which foreign investors are prohibited from or restricted to investing. If variable interest entities fall within the definition of foreign investment entities, the Groups ability to use the contractual arrangements with its VIEs and the Groups ability to conduct business through the VIEs could be severely limited.\nIf the PRC government otherwise finds that the Group in violation of any existing or future PRC laws or regulations or lacks the necessary permits or licenses to operate the business, the Groups relevant PRC regulatory authorities could:\n\u25cf revoke the business licenses and/or operating licenses of the Groups PRC entities;\n\u25cf impose fines;\n\u25cf confiscate any income that they deem to be obtained through illegal operations, or impose other requirements with which the Group may not be able to comply;\n\u25cf discontinue or place restrictions or onerous conditions on the Groups operations;\n\u25cf place restrictions on the right to collect revenues;\n\u25cf require the Group to restructure ownership structure or operations, including terminating the contractual agreements with the VIEs and deregistering the equity pledges of the VIEs, which in turn would affect the ability to consolidate the financial results of and derive economic interests from the VIEs and their subsidiaries;\n\u25cf restrict or prohibit the use of the proceeds from financing activities to finance the business and operations of the VIEs and their subsidiaries; or\n\u25cf take other regulatory or enforcement actions that could be harmful to the Groups business.\nThe imposition of any of these penalties may result in a material and adverse effect on the Groups ability to conduct the Groups business. In addition, if the imposition of any of these penalties causes the Group to lose the rights to direct the activities of the VIEs or the right to receive its economic benefits, the Group would no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs. The management believes that the likelihood for the Group to lose such ability is remote based on current facts and circumstances. However, the interpretation and implementation of the laws and regulations in the PRC and their application to an effect on the legality, binding effect and enforceability of contracts are subject to the discretion of competent PRC authorities, and therefore there is no assurance that relevant PRC authorities will take the same position as the Group herein in respect of the legality, binding effect and enforceability of each of the contractual arrangements. Meanwhile, since the PRC legal system continues to rapidly evolve, it may lead to changes in PRC laws, regulations and policies or in the interpretation and application of existing laws, regulations and policies, which may limit legal protections available to the Group to enforce the contractual arrangements should the VIEs or the Nominee Shareholders of the VIEs fail to perform their obligations under those arrangements. The enforceability, and therefore the benefits, of the contractual agreements between the Company and the VIEs depend on Nominee Shareholders enforcing the contracts. There is a risk that Nominee shareholders of VIEs, who in some cases are also shareholders of the Company may have conflict of interests with the Company in the future or fail to perform their contractual obligations. Given the significance and importance of the VIEs, there would be a significant negative impact to the Company if these contracts were not enforced.\nThe Groups operations depend on the VIEs to honor their contractual agreements with the Group. The Companys ability to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance and the Companys right to receive the economic benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs depend on the authorization by the shareholders of the VIEs to exercise voting rights on all matters requiring shareholder approval in the VIEs. The Company believes that the agreements on authorization to exercise shareholders voting power are enforceable against each party thereto in accordance with their terms and applicable PRC laws or regulations currently in effect and the possibility that it will no longer be able to consolidate the VIEs as a result of the aforementioned risks and uncertainties is remote.\nc. Summary of financial information of the Groups VIEs (inclusive of VIEs subsidiaries)\nThe following tables set forth the financial statement balances and amounts of the VIEs and their subsidiaries included in the condensed consolidated financial statements after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions among VIEs and their subsidiaries within the Group.\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Groups VIEs have been audited by filing the Form 8-K for the year ended May 31, 2022.\nSchedule of Variable Interest Entities Financial Statements\nMay 31,\nMay 31,\n(Audited)\n$ $\nCash and cash equivalents 401,984 106,542\nRestricted cash 10,273 2,245\nAccounts receivable 409,380 355,598\nInventories 177,034 78,995\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 2,045,736 6,353,787\nPlant and equipment, net 6,581,823 6,956,399\nIntangible assets, net 15,543 13,282\nRight-of-use assets 277,184 946,296\nOther non-current assets 2,884,090 3,552,736\nTotal Assets 12,803,047 18,365,880\nAccounts payables 749,226 565,067\nAdvances from customers 622,069 20,400\nOther current payables 1,300,969 1,627,732\nTaxes payable 18,737 19,427\nAmounts due to related parties 540,897 394,077\nOperating lease liabilities, current 126,659 637,110\nLong-term loan 32,740,623 33,211,152\nOperating lease liabilities 121,555 300,438\nTotal Liabilities 36,220,735 36,775,403\nTotal (Deficit) Equity of VIEs (23,417,688 ) (18,409,523 )\nTotal Liabilities and (Deficit) Equity of VIEs 12,803,047 18,365,880\nMay 31,\nMay 31,\n(Audited)\n$ $\nNet revenues 3,723,088 3,563,527\nCost of revenues (4,132,481 ) (4,571,107 )\nGross loss (409,393 ) (1,007,580 )\nTotal costs and expenses (5,835,586 ) (5,860,705 )\nOperating income/(loss) (6,244,979 ) (6,868,285 )\nTotal other income and (expenses) (92,528 ) 52,627\nLoss before taxes from operations (6,337,507 ) (6,815,658 )\nProvision for income taxes (223 ) -\nNet loss (6,337,730 ) (6,815,658 )\nNet loss attributable to VIEs (5,949,596 ) (6,548,669 )\n(Audited)\nYear Ended May 31,\n(Audited)\nNet cash provided by/(used in) operating activities 541,233 (17,047,129 )\nNet cash (used in)/provided by investing activities (1,614,513 ) 187,610\nNet cash provided by financing activities 1,392,188 16,838,474\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (15,438 ) (5,256 )\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents 303,470 (26,301 )\nCash and cash equivalents at the beginning of period 108,787 135,088\nCash and cash equivalents at the end of period 412,257 108,787\n3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements include the balances and results of operations of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) and in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (US GAAP).\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented on the basis that the Company is a going concern. The going concern assumption contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nThe Company incurred net loss of $6,783,522 during the year ended May 31, 2023. As of May 31, 2023, the Company had total deficit of $23,887,645 and had net cash provided by operating activities of $102,130. The Company incurred net loss of $6,894,883 during the year ended May 31, 2022. As of May 31, 2022, the Company had total deficit of $18,433,688 and had net cash used in operating activities of $17,094,189.\nThe ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon long-term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThese conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on long term loans related to Shaoxing Keqiao Zhuyi Technology Co. and the director (Guowei Zhang) to meet obligations as they become due and to obtain additional equity or alternative financing required to fund operations until sufficient sources of recurring revenues can be generated. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in its plans described above or in attracting equity or alternative financing on acceptable terms, or if at all. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nMethod of accounting\nManagement has prepared the accompanying financial statements and these notes in accordance to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company maintains its general ledger and journals with the accrual method accounting.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nBusiness Combination and Non-controlling Interests\nOn December 15, 2022, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement) with Intellegence Parking Group Limited (Intellegence), a Cayman Island company formed on June 29, 2022, Chen Xinxin (Xinxin), the officer and director, and control shareholder of Intelligence and the shareholders of Intelligence (the Shareholders). Under the Share Exchange Agreement, One Hundred Percent (100%) of the ownership interest of Intellegence was exchanged for 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock of SVMB issued to the Shareholders, in accordance with the Share Exchange Agreement. The former stockholders of Intellegence will acquire a majority of the issued and outstanding common stock as a result of the share exchange transaction. The transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization of the Company, whereby Intellegence is the accounting acquirer.\nImmediately after completion of such share exchange, SVMB will hold a total of 200,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of Intellegence. Zhang Guowei is the sole director of Intellegence Parking Group Limited.\nSVMB and Intellegence consolidated the financial statements through common control. As a result, the Company measured the recognized assets and liabilities combined at their historical cost at the acquisition date. The difference between consideration paid and assets and liabilities received are presented as a component of equity and additional paid-in-capital.\nZhejiang Jingbo Ecological Technology and Hangzhou Zhuyi, Linglingyi, Lingshan, Anping, Haikou, Yibin, Xide Tongpo and Taining consolidated the financial statements through acquisition.\nJingbo accounts for its business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the assets transferred to the sellers, liabilities incurred by Jingbo and equity instruments issued by Jingbo. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured separately at their fair values as of the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interests. The excess of (i) the total costs of acquisition, fair value of the non-controlling interests and acquisition date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over (ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized directly in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nIn a business combination achieved in stages, Jingbo re-measures the previously held equity interest in the acquiree immediately before obtaining control at its acquisition date fair value and the re-measurement gain or loss, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Jingbo its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs subsidiaries for which the Company is considered the ultimate primary beneficiary for accounting purposes.\nA subsidiary is an entity in which the Company directly or indirectly controls more than one half of the voting power, has the power to appoint or remove the majority of the members of the board of directors, to cast a majority of notes at the meeting of the board of directors or to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee under a statute or agreement among the shareholders or equity holders.\nA VIE is an entity in which the Companys subsidiary, through contractual agreements, has the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact their economic performance, and has the right to receive economic benefits from the VIEs that could potentially be significant to them, and therefore the Company is considered the ultimate primary beneficiary of the entity for accounting purposes.\nAll transactions and balances among the Company, its subsidiaries, the VIEs and VIEs subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. The results of subsidiaries and VIEs acquired or disposed of during the year are recorded in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss from the effective dates of acquisition or up to the effective dates of disposal, as appropriate.\nSegment Reporting\nOperating segments are defined as components of an enterprise engaging in business activities for which separate financial information is available that is regularly evaluated by the Companys chief operating decision maker (CODM) in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The CODM, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as certain members of the Companys management team, including the chief executive officer (CEO).\nThe Company has organized operations into three different areas: (1) parking fee, (2) sales of parking lot equipment, and (3) other services. As the parking fee and sales of parking lot equipment are of the same nature, CODM accesses that there is only one operating segment which is car parking income.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less, and unencumbered bank deposits to be cash equivalents.\nAccounts receivables\nTrade receivables are recognized and carried at the original invoice amount less allowance for any uncollectible amounts. An expected credit loss is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off against expected credit loss allowances.\nInventories\nInventories solely consist of consumable parts for sales are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Consumable parts for sales costs include: materials, direct labor, inbound shipping costs, and allocated overhead. The Company applies the weighted average cost method to its inventory.\nPlant and Equipment\nAn item of plant and equipment is stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated allowance for decrease in value (if any).\nThe cost of an item of plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes (after deducting trade discounts and rebates) and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. These can include the initial estimate of costs of dismantling and removing the item, and restoring the site on which it is located, the obligation for which an entity incurs either when the item is acquired or as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period.\nThe cost of replacing part of plant and equipment is included in the carrying amount of the asset when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the Company and the carrying amount of those replaced parts is derecognized. Repairs and maintenance are charged to the statement of income during the financial period in which they are incurred.\nDepreciation is provided over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the plant and equipment are as follows:\nSchedule of Estimated Useful Live\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment 3-5 years\nBuilding years\nVehicles 4-5 years\nProject facilities 2-5 years\nThe cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts, and any gain or loss are included in the Companys results of operations. The costs of maintenance and repairs are recognized to expenses as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized.\nImpairment of long-lived assets\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. Whenever there is an indication showing a permanent decrease in the amount of leasehold improvement and equipment; such as evidence of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used or is expected to be used, the Company shall recognize loss on decrease in value of plant and equipment in the statement of income where the carrying amount of asset is higher than the recoverable amount. The Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying value of the long-lived assets to the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected discounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company would recognize impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets. The Company did not record any impairment losses on long-lived assets during the years ended May 31, 2023 and 2022.\nStatutory reserves\nStatutory reserves are referring to the amount appropriated from the net income in accordance with laws or regulations, which can be used to recover losses and increase capital, as approved, and are to be used to expand production or operations. PRC laws prescribe that an enterprise operating at a profit must appropriate and reserve, on an annual basis, an amount equal to 10% of its profit. Such an appropriation is necessary until the reserve reaches a maximum that is equal to 50% of the enterprises PRC registered capital.\nLeases\nLeases are classified at the inception date as either a finance lease or an operating lease. As the lessee, a lease is a finance lease if any of the following conditions exists: a) ownership is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term, b) there is a bargain purchase option, c) the lease term is at least 75% of the assets estimated remaining economic life, or d) the present value of the minimum lease payments at the beginning of the lease term is 90% or more of the fair value of the leased asset to the lessor at the inception date.\nAll other leases are accounted for as operating leases wherein rental payments are expensed on a straight-line basis over the periods of their respective leases. Operating leases (with an initial term of more than 12 months) are included in operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets, operating lease liabilities (current), and operating lease liabilities (non-current) in the balance sheets. ROU assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company utilizes a market-based approach to estimate the incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nThe Company reviews its lease for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may no longer be recoverable. Whenever there is an indication showing a permanent decrease in the amount of lease; such as an evidence of obsolescence or physical damage of an asset, significant changes in the manner in which an asset is used or is expected to be used, the Company shall recognize loss on decrease in value of lease in the statement of income where the carrying amount of asset is higher than the recoverable amount. The Company measures impairment by comparing the carrying value of the lease to the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected discounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount of the assets, the Company would recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the assets\nValue added tax (VAT)\nThe Company is subject to value-added tax (VAT) for providing services and sales of products. Revenue from providing services and sales of products is generally subject to VAT at applicable tax rates, and subsequently paid to PRC tax authorities after netting input VAT on purchases. The excess of output VAT over input VAT is reflected in accrued expenses and other payables. The Company reports revenue net of PRCs VAT for all the periods presented in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.\nForeign currency translation\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The functional currencies of the Company are in Renminbi (RMB). The Companys assets and liabilities are translated into United States dollars from RMB at year-end exchange rates, and its revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate during the year. Capital accounts are translated at their historical exchange rates when the capital transactions occurred.\nSchedule of Foreign Currency Translation\nYear end RMB: US$ exchange rate 7.1100 6.6624\nAnnual average RMB: US$ exchange rate 6.9185 6.4310\nThe RMB is not freely convertible into foreign currencies and all foreign exchange transactions must be conducted through authorized financial institutions.\nIncome recognition\nRecognition of Revenue\nRevenue is reported net of business taxes and VAT. The Companys main income is from parking fee.\nRevenue is recognized when services are rendered. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amount of revenue that is recorded reflects the consideration that the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods. The Company applies the following five-step model in order to determine this amount:\n(i) identification of the services in the contract;\n(ii) determination of whether the services are performance obligations, including whether they are distinct in the context of the contract;\n(iii) measurement of the transaction price, including the constraint on variable consideration;\n(iv) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations; and\n(v) recognition of revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThe Company only applies the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the Company will collect the consideration it is entitled to in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer. Once a contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606 at contract inception, the Company reviews the contract to determine which performance obligations the Company must deliver and which of these performance obligations are distinct. The Company recognizes as revenues the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Generally, the Companys performance obligations are transferred to customers at a point in time, typically upon delivery.\nFor all reporting periods, the Company has not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for all service revenue contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, which is an optional exemption that is permitted under the adopted rules.\nOther Income and other expenses\nOther income and other expenses are recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant agreements.\nAdvertising\nAll advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nResearch and development\nAll research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nRetirement benefits\nRetirement benefits in the form of mandatory government sponsored defined contribution plans are charged to the either expenses as incurred or allocated to inventory as part of overhead.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred taxation and is recognized in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity, in which case it is recognized directly in other comprehensive income or equity. Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable with respect to previous periods.\nThe Company accounts for income tax using an asset and liability approach and allows for recognition of deferred tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future realization is uncertain.\nThe Company accounts for uncertain tax positions by reporting a liability for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits are recognized from uncertain tax positions when the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expenses.\nComprehensive income\nThe Company uses FASB ASC Topic 220, Reporting Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and all changes to the statements of stockholders equity, except the changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders due to investments by stockholders.\nEarnings per share\nThe Company computes earnings per share (EPS) in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per share. Basic EPS is measured as the income or loss available to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis from the potential conversion of convertible securities or the exercise of options and or warrants; the dilutive effects of potentially convertible securities are calculated using the as-if method; the potentially dilutive effect of options or warrants are calculated using the treasury stock method. Securities that are potentially an anti-dilutive effect (i.e. those that increase income per share or decrease loss per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments, including cash and equivalents, accounts and other receivables, accounts and other payables, accrued liabilities and short-term debt, have carrying amounts that approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\u25cf Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology used quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\n\u25cf Level 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815.\nCommitments and contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Statements. This ASU requires a financial asset (or group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. This Accounting Standards Update affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual rights to receive cash. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). The adoption does not have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nThe Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. Management has not identified any other new standards that it believes will have a significant impact on the Companys financial statements.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which addresses the presentation of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. The guidance requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting for Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. The guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued guidance, which amends the existing accounting standards for the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The updated guidance primarily addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of this guidance on the financial statements.\n4. Trade Receivables\nThe Company does not provide any credit terms to its customers for smart parking. Cash will be collected by the exit of parking lots. The Company provides one to three months credits term for customers purchasing parking equipment.\n5.

Reserves\nStatutory reserve\nPursuant to the laws applicable to the PRCs Foreign Investment Enterprises, the Company must make appropriations from after-tax profit to non-distributable reserve funds. Subject to certain cumulative limits, the general reserve requires annual appropriations of 10% of after-tax profits as determined under the PRC laws and regulations at each year-end until the balance reaches 50% of the PRC entity registered capital; the other reserve appropriations are at the Companys discretion.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risks\nA.\nCredit risk\nThe Companys deposits are with banks located in the PRC. They do not carry federal deposit insurance and may be subject to loss if the banks become insolvent.\nAccounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers in the PRC. The credit risk with respect to account receivables is mitigated by credit control policies we carry out with respect to our customers and our ongoing monitoring process of outstanding balances.\nB. Economic and political risks\nThe Companys operations are conducted in the PRC. Accordingly, the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations may be influenced by changes in the political, economic, and legal environments in the PRC.\nThe Companys operations in the PRC are subject to special considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environment and foreign currency exchange. The Companys results may be adversely affected by changes in the political and social conditions in the PRC, and by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion, remittances abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.\nC.\nInterest risk\nThe Company is subject to interest rate risk when long term loans become due and require refinancing.\nD. Sensitivity analysis\nThe long-term loans are free of interest for the first 32 months however if interest were to charge at an annual rate of 4%, interest expense would be $1.3 million per year. The Company adopts 4% as an annual interest rate based on the China LPR announced on May 22, 2023 with an adjustment to loan terms. If interest rate increases or decreases by 10%, it could lead to an increase or decrease in interest expense of $32,371 per year.\n18. Significant Events\nBy the end of May 31, 2023, the Company has entered into four contracts with four agents allowing them to use our software application to parking lots in the cities that are specified in the contracts for collecting parking fees. Royalty fees will be charged to these agents. The manual of the application was delivered to these agents in June, 2023. The Company expects to receive royalty fee from the third quarter.\n19. Subsequent Events\nThe Company has performed an evaluation of subsequent events through October 2, 2023, which was the date of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements, and determined that no events would have required adjustment or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements other than that discussed above.\n20. Comparative figure\nSVMB consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2022 are not audited. Figures consolidated up to Zhejiang Jingbo Ecological Technology Co. have been audited which have been marked as audited in the Summary of financial information of the Groups VIEs (inclusive of VIEs subsidiaries) under the Variable Interest Entities section.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nSee above. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in or disagreements with accountants regarding our accounting, financial disclosures or any other matter. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes- Oxley (SOX) Section 404 A. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of May 31,2023.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that the Companys management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: ( 1) lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Companys board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (4) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the Companys Chief Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of May 31, 2023 and communicated the matters to our management.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2), (3) and (4) above did not have an effect on the Companys financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the Companys board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the Companys determination to its financial statements for the future years.\nWe are committed to improving our financial organization. As part of this commitment, we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the Company: i) Appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to the audit committee of the Company resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and ii) Preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements.\nManagement believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors, who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee, will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the Companys Board. In addition, management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses (i) insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of US GAAP and SEC disclosure requirements; and (ii) ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes. Further, management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department. Additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the Company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur. This coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future.\nWe will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of the companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by the companys registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only managements report in this annual report.\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a- 15 or 15d- 15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the small business issuers last fiscal year that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes that have affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a- 15(f) or 15d- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023.
