    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nGeneral\nThe use of terms \"Winnebago Industries,\" \"Winnebago,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to Winnebago Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. is one of the leading North American manufacturers of recreation vehicles (\"RV\"s) and marine products with a diversified portfolio used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreational activities. We also design and manufacture advanced battery solutions that deliver house power, supporting internal electrical features and appliances for a variety of outdoor products including RVs, boats, specialty and other low-speed vehicles, as well as other industrial applications. We produce our towable RV units in Indiana; our motorhome RV units in Iowa and Indiana; our marine units in Indiana and Florida; and our battery solutions in Florida. We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Our battery solutions are primarily sold to customers in the U.S.\nFiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023, Fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, and Fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ended August 28, 2021. The financial statements presented are all 52-week fiscal periods.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet website, located at www.winnebagoind.com, provides additional information about us. On our website you can obtain, free of charge, this and prior year Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all other recent filings with the SEC. Our recent press releases and important information regarding our corporate governance practices are also available on our website. Information contained on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The SEC also maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC which can be accessed at http://www.sec.gov.\nReportable Segment Name Changes\nIn the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, we changed the name of our Towable segment to Towable RV and our Motorhome segment to Motorhome RV. These name changes had no impact on the composition of our segments, or previously reported results of operations, financial position, cash flows or segment results.\nPrincipal Products\nOur operations are organized into three reportable segments, Towable RV, Motorhome RV, and Marine, based on similarities within their markets, products, operations and distributions.\nTowable RV\nA towable RV is a non-motorized vehicle that is designed to be towed by automobiles, pickup trucks, SUVs, or vans and is used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support active and mobile lifestyles. The Recreation Vehicle Industry Association (\"RVIA\") classifies towable RVs into four types: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camper trailers, and truck campers. We manufacture and sell conventional travel trailers and fifth wheels under the Winnebago and Grand Design brand names, which are defined as follows:\nType Description Winnebago product offerings Grand Design product offerings\nTravel trailer Towed by means of a hitch attached to the frame of the vehicle HIKE, Micro Minnie, Minnie, and Voyage Imagine, Momentum, Reflection, and Transcend\nFifth wheel Constructed with a raised forward section that is connected to the vehicle with a special fifth wheel hitch N/A Momentum, Reflection, and Solitude\nOur travel trailer and fifth wheel towable RVs are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $30,000 to $150,000, which can vary depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.\nMotorhome RV\nA motorhome RV is a self-propelled mobile dwelling used primarily as temporary living quarters during vacation and camping trips, or to support active and mobile lifestyles. The RVIA classifies motorhome RVs into three types, all of which we manufacture and sell under the Winnebago and Newmar brand names, which are defined as follows:\nType Description Winnebago product offerings Newmar product offerings\nClass A Built on a heavy truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with the ability to tow a small vehicle Gas: Adventurer, Sunstar, and Vista Gas: Bay Star and Bay Star Sport\nDiesel: Forza and Journey Diesel: Canyon Star, Dutch Star, Essex, King Aire, Kountry Star, London Aire, Mountain Aire, New Aire, and Ventana\nClass B Built by adding a taller roof and amenities to an existing van, which allows for easy maneuvering Gas: Solis and Travato N/A\nDiesel: Boldt, Era, Revel, and Roam\nClass C Built on a medium truck chassis in both diesel and gas models with similar features and amenities to Class A models Gas: Ekko, Minnie Winnie, and Spirit Diesel: Super Star and Supreme Aire\nDiesel: Navion, Porto, View, and Vita\nOur Class A, Class B, and Class C motorhome RVs are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $140,000 to $1,650,000, which can vary depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges. Our motorhome RVs range in length from 18 to 45 feet.\nMotorhome RV parts and service activities represent revenues generated by service work we perform for retail customers at our Forest City, Iowa and Nappanee, Indiana facilities as well as revenues from the sale of unit parts. Our competitive strategy is to provide proprietary manufactured parts through our dealer network, which we believe increases customer satisfaction and the value of our motorhome RVs.\nMarine\nWe manufacture and sell premium quality recreational boats under our Chris-Craft and Barletta brands through an established network of independent authorized dealers.\nType Chris-Craft product offerings Barletta product offerings\nBoats Calypso, Catalina, Launch, and Launch GT Aria, Cabrio, Corsa, Lusso, and Reserve\nOur boats are sold by dealers in the retail market with manufacturer's suggested retail prices ranging from approximately $60,000 to $770,000, which can vary depending on size and model, plus optional equipment and delivery charges.\nWinnebago Specialty Vehicles\nWe manufacture accessibility enhanced motorhomes under the Winnebago brand name, which are vehicles with a wheelchair lift to allow individuals with physical disabilities access to the motorhome. In addition, we also manufacture other specialty commercial vehicles custom designed for the buyer's specific needs and requirements, such as law enforcement command centers, mobile medical clinics, and mobile office space. We also provide commercial vehicles as bare shells to third-party upfitters for conversion at their facilities. These specialty commercial vehicles are manufactured in Forest City, Iowa and sold through our dealer network.\nLithionics\nOn April 28, 2023, we acquired 100% of the equity interests Lithionics Battery, LLC and Lithionics LLC (collectively, \"Lithionics\"), a premier lithium-ion battery solutions provider to the recreational equipment and specialty vehicle markets. Using a proprietary battery management system called NeverDie\u00ae Technology, Lithionics offers a broad range of standard and custom-designed battery configurations delivering house power and supporting internal electrical features and appliances for a variety of outdoor products, including RVs, boats, specialty and other low-speed vehicles, as well as other industrial applications. These batteries are manufactured in Clearwater, Florida. Refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for further detail regarding the acquisition.\nProduction\nWe generally produce towable RVs, motorhome RVs, and marine products made to order for dealers. We have some ability to increase our capacity by scheduling overtime and/or hiring additional production employees or to decrease our capacity through the use of shortened work weeks and/or reducing head count. We have long been known as an industry leader in innovation as each year we introduce new or redesigned products. These changes generally include new floor plans, features, functionality, and sizes as well as design and decor modifications. Most of our raw materials such as steel, aluminum, fiberglass, and wood products are obtainable from numerous sources.\nOur towable RVs are produced at two assembly campuses located in Middlebury, Indiana. The majority of components are comprised of frames, appliances, and furniture, and are purchased from multiple suppliers.\nOur motorhome RVs are produced in the states of Iowa and Indiana at five different assembly campuses. Our motorhome RV business utilizes vertically integrated supply streams, with the principal exceptions being chassis, engines, generators, and appliances that we purchase from multiple suppliers. Certain parts, especially motorhome RV chassis, are available from a small group of suppliers.\nOur marine products are produced in the states of Indiana and Florida at two different assembly campuses. We manufacture certain components and purchase other components from suppliers and install them on the boat. Certain parts, especially motors, are available from a small group of suppliers.\nBacklog\nWe strive to balance timely order fulfillment to our dealers with the lead times suppliers require to efficiently source materials and manage costs. Production facility constraints at peak periods also lead to fluctuations in backlog orders, which we manage closely. A more detailed description of our Towable RV, Motorhome RV, and Marine order backlog is included in Item 7 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDistribution and Financing\nWe distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Foreign sales accounted for less than 10% of net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.\nAs of August 26, 2023, our RV and marine dealer network in the U.S. and Canada included approximately 750 physical dealer locations, many of which carry more than one of our brands. None of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years.\nWe have sales and service agreements with most dealers, which are subject to annual review. Many of the dealers are also engaged in other areas of business, including the sale of automobiles, trailers, or boats, and most dealers carry one or more competitive lines of products. We continue to place high emphasis on the capability of our dealers to provide complete service for our products. Dealers are obligated to provide full service for owners of our products or, in lieu thereof, to secure such service from other authorized providers.\nWe advertise and promote our products through national trade magazines, product brochures, the Go RVing national advertising campaign sponsored by RVIA, our websites, social media, direct-mail advertising campaigns, various national promotional opportunities, and on a local basis through trade shows, television, radio, and newspapers, primarily in connection with area dealers.\nSales to dealers are made primarily on cash terms. Most dealers are financed on a \"floorplan\" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the merchandise purchased. As is customary in the industries we serve, we typically enter into a repurchase agreement with a lending institution financing a dealer's purchase of our product upon the lending institution's request and after completion of a credit check of the dealer involved. Our repurchase agreements provide that, for up to 18 months after an RV unit is financed and up to 24 months after a marine unit is financed, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise from the lender at the amount then due, which is often less than dealer invoice. Our maximum exposure for repurchases can vary significantly, depending upon the level of dealer inventory, general economic conditions, demand for our products, dealer location, and access to and the cost of financing. See Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information.\nCompetition\nThe RV and marine markets are highly competitive with many other manufacturers selling products which compete directly with our products. Some of our competitors are much larger than us, most notably in the towable RV market, which may provide these competitors additional purchasing power. The competition in our industries is based upon design, price, quality, features, and service of the products. We believe our principal competitive advantages are our brand strength, product differentiation, product quality, and our service after the sale. We also believe that our products have historically commanded a price premium as a result of these competitive advantages.\nSeasonality\nThe primary use of RVs and marine products for leisure travel and outdoor recreation has historically led to a peak retail selling season concentrated in the spring and summer months and lower sales during fall and winter months. Our sales are generally influenced by this pattern in retail sales, but sales can also be impacted by the level of dealer inventory. As a result, our sales are historically lowest during our second fiscal quarter, which ends in February.\nGovernmental Regulations\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and, to a limited extent, international laws and regulations, including the federal Motor Vehicle Act (\"MVA\"), under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (\"NHTSA\") may require manufacturers to recall RVs that contain safety-related defects, and numerous state consumer protection laws and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles, including so-called \"Lemon Laws.\" The Boat Safety Act of 1971 has similar safety-related recall requirements for marine units. In addition, marine units sold in the U.S. and Europe must meet the certification standards of the U.S. Coast Guard and the European Community, respectively.\nWe are also subject to regulations established by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\"OSHA\"). Our facilities are periodically inspected by federal and state agencies, such as OSHA. We are a member of RVIA, a voluntary association of RV manufacturers, which promulgates RV safety standards. We place an RVIA seal on each of our RVs to certify that the RVIA standards have been met. We believe that our products and facilities comply in all material respects with the applicable vehicle safety, consumer protection, RVIA, and OSHA regulations and standards.\nOur operations are subject to a variety of federal and state environmental laws and regulations relating to the use, generation, storage, treatment, emission, labeling, and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, and noise pollution. We believe that we are currently in compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations in all material aspects.\nTrademarks\nOur products are marketed under a variety of valuable trademarks. Some of the more important trademarks used in our business include Winnebago, Grand Design, Newmar, Chris-Craft, Barletta and Lithionics. We protect these trademarks as appropriate through registrations in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. Depending on jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be renewed indefinitely for as long as the trademarks are in use.\nWe continue our focus on developing and marketing innovative, proprietary products, many of which use proprietary expertise, trade secrets, and know-how. We consider the collective rights under our various patents, which expire from time to time, a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.\nHuman Capital Management\nOur employees are our greatest strength and we are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, high-performance culture where our people thrive. We strive to recruit, develop, engage and protect our workforce. The following are key human capital measures and objectives that we currently focus on:\nEmployee Experience - Leadership and Culture Development\nWe believe our future success depends on our people. Attracting, engaging, retaining and developing diverse talent is a key priority. We strive to grow and develop all of our teams and bolster our talent pipeline. Our leadership expectations provide a shared understanding of the skills our teams develop through continuous learning opportunities and training. Our Code of Conduct and our human rights policy include shared values and guide relationships with our people and our stakeholders. To build and attract the next generation of leaders, we have developed external partnerships, introducing high school and first-generation college students to potential career opportunities in the RV and marine industries. To increase the pipeline of diverse talent in the outdoor industry, we provided founding support to the Leaders from The Future of Work Internship Program in partnership with nonprofit partner Camber Outdoors. This innovative, diversity, equity, and inclusive (\"DEI\") focused internship program engages Black, Latino, Asian American and Pacific Islander, and Native/Indigenous students in meaningful paid summer internships. We\nalso collaborate with regional education and workforce development partners to connect job seekers with on-the-job training and leadership development.\nTeam members respond regularly to an engagement survey, administered at least every two years, that evaluates our employees thoughts about their experience working at Winnebago Industries. Responses are reviewed by team leaders and used to help build specific action plans to continually improve our employee engagement, satisfaction, and retention. We engage employees through community volunteerism, team-building, and employee resource groups. We strive to continually improve our employee experience, develop and grow our teams, and create a culture of inclusion and belonging.\nAs of August 26, 2023, we employed approximately 6,250 persons, of which approximately 28% and 72% were non-production and production workers, respectively. In addition, approximately 18% and 82% were salaried and hourly employees, respectively. None of our employees are covered under a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our relations with our employees are good.\nCommitment to Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, and Action (\"IDEA\")\nWe believe in the value of building a company and community where every person feels welcome, is treated fairly, and has an equal opportunity to succeed while bringing their authentic self to work. In our second year of implementing our All In, Outdoors roadmap, we continued to center creating a better sense of belonging in our workplace, our communities, and the outdoors. We advanced our strategy by listening and learning, including by establishing an IDEA Speaker series, where subject matter experts provide inspiration, tools, and resources to create an inclusive culture. In addition, our Courageous Conversations program helps build connections with employees through conversations that provide awareness and understanding around community and cultural sensitivities that can be difficult in the workplace. We launched our first employee resource group in 2022, the Womens Inclusion Network (\"WIN\"), whose mission is to support the professional development of women by encouraging access to learning, mentoring, and networking. WINs goal is to provide programming and tools, increase womens sense of belonging, and the percentage of women in leadership roles within our businesses. We remain involved with partners who help advance our goals including CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, Society of Women Engineers, Women in Manufacturing, RV Womens Alliance, and more.\nWe are committed to increasing inclusion across our industry and beyond. Approximately 24% of our executive and senior leadership team members are women and 11% are racially or ethnically diverse. We continue to expand our partnerships with nonprofit organizations led by and for communities of color and women and organizations helping to diversify the talent pipeline including Camber Outdoors and the Society of Women Engineers.\nWe also recognize the importance of having diverse perspectives on our Board of Directors and aspire to promote diversity as we build and refresh our Board of Directors. Our IDEA framework, which serves as a roadmap to guide us forward on our inclusion journey, includes the Board of Directors, leadership development, and engagement. As of August 26, 2023, 22% of our Board of Directors were women, and 22% were racially or ethnically diverse.\nWe believe our company and our brands should reflect the diversity of outdoor enthusiasts. We also believe we thrive and are more successful when we empower, value, and respect our employees and our communities. We are committed to continuing to build a stronger, more inclusive culture and workplace.\nEmployee Well-being and Safety\nWinnebago Industries is committed to designing, operating, and maintaining safe, controlled working conditions and a zero-harm culture. We operate under the principle that all workplace injuries and illnesses are predictable and preventable. We aspire to control all workplace exposures to risk on our road to zero-harm, and we embed safety as part of our DNA that guides our purpose, culture, and operations. With the mental, emotional, and physical well-being of our employees as a key focus, we have provided resources for employees to manage remote work and balance parental and other family responsibilities. In Fiscal 2023, our total recordable incident rate (\"TRIR\") was 4.93, a 16% improvement compared to 5.85 in Fiscal 2022. In Fiscal 2023, our days away restricted transfer rate (\"DART\") was 2.14, a 33% improvement compared to 3.20 in Fiscal 2022. We are an industry leader in workplace safety and our commitment to safety never stops.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nName Office (Year First Elected an Officer) Age\nMichael J.

Risk Factors.\nDescribed below are certain risks that we believe apply to our business and the industries in which we operate. The following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties highlighted represent the most significant risk factors that we believe may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing, and, consequently, the market value of our common stock. The risks and uncertainties discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are not exclusive and other risk factors that we may consider immaterial or do not anticipate may emerge as significant risks and uncertainties.\nMacroeconomic Risks\nOur business may be sensitive to economic conditions, including those that impact consumer spending.\nCompanies within the RV and marine industries are subject to volatility in operating results due primarily to general economic conditions because the purchase of a RV or marine product is often viewed as a consumer discretionary purchase. Demand for discretionary goods in general can fluctuate with recessionary conditions, slow or negative economic growth rates, negative consumer confidence, reduced consumer spending levels resulting from tax increases or other factors, prolonged high unemployment rates, higher commodity and component costs, fuel prices, inflationary or deflationary pressures, reduced credit availability or unfavorable credit terms for dealers and end-user customers, higher short-term interest rates, and general economic and political conditions and expectations. Specific factors affecting the RV and marine industries include:\nOverall consumer confidence and the level of discretionary consumer spending;\nEmployment trends;\nFuel prices;\nInflationary pressures affecting disposable consumer income;\nInterest rate fluctuations;\nThe adverse impact of global tensions on consumer spending and travel-related activities; and\nThe adverse impact on margins due to increases in raw material costs, which we are unable to pass on to customers without negatively affecting sales.\nCredit market deterioration and volatility may restrict the ability of our dealers and retail customers to finance the purchase of our products.\nOur business is affected by the availability and terms of the financing to dealers. Generally, RV and marine dealers finance their purchases of inventory with financing provided by lending institutions. One financial flooring institution held approximately 33% of our total financed dealer inventory dollars that were outstanding at August 26, 2023. In the event that this lending institution limits or discontinues dealer financing, we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is also affected by the availability and terms of financing to retail purchasers. Retail buyers purchasing one of our products may elect to finance their purchase through the dealership or a financial institution of their choice. Substantial increases in interest rates or decreases in the general availability of credit for our dealers or for the retail purchaser may have an adverse impact upon our business and results of operations.\nIndustry Risks\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Failure to compete effectively against competitors could negatively impact our business and operating results.\nThe markets for RVs and marine products are very competitive. Competitive factors in the industries include price, design, value, quality, service, brand awareness, and reputation. There can be no assurance that existing or new competitors will not develop products that are superior to our products or that achieve better consumer acceptance, thereby adversely affecting our market share, sales volume, and profit margins. Some of our competitors are much larger than we are, and this size advantage provides these competitors with more financial resources and access to capital, additional purchasing power, and greater leverage with the dealer networks. In addition, competition could increase if new companies enter the market, existing competitors consolidate their operations, or if existing competitors expand their product lines or intensify efforts within existing product lines. Our current products, products under development, and our ability to develop new and improved products may be insufficient to enable us to\ncompete effectively with our competitors. These competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to continue to enhance existing products and develop and market new or enhanced products that respond to customer needs and preferences, we may experience a decrease in demand for our products and our business could suffer.\nOne of our growth strategies is to develop innovative, customer-valued products to generate revenue growth. We may not be able to compete as effectively with our competitors, and ultimately satisfy the needs and preferences of our customers, unless we can continue to enhance existing products and develop new innovative products for the markets in which we compete. Product development requires significant financial, technological, and other resources. Product improvements and new product introductions also require significant research, planning, design, development, engineering, and testing at the technological, product, and manufacturing process levels, and we may not be able to timely develop and introduce product improvements or new products. Our competitors' new products may beat our products to market, be higher quality or more reliable, be more effective with more features and/or less expensive than our products, obtain better market acceptance, or render our products obsolete. Any new products that we develop may not receive market acceptance or otherwise generate any meaningful net sales or profits for us relative to our expectations based on, among other things, existing and anticipated investments in manufacturing capacity and commitments to fund advertising, marketing, promotional programs, and research and development.\nIf we are unable to properly forecast future demand of our products, our production levels may not meet demand, which could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur ability to manage our inventory levels to meet our customers' demand for our products is important for our business. For example, certain dealers are focused on the rental market which spikes over the summer vacation period while other dealers are focused on direct sales to the consumer at various price points. Our production levels and inventory management are based on demand estimates six to twelve months forward, taking into account supply lead times, production capacity, timing of shipments, and dealer inventory levels. If we overestimate or underestimate demand for any of our products during a given season, we may not maintain appropriate inventory levels, which could negatively impact our net sales or working capital, hinder our ability to meet customer demand, or cause us to incur excess and obsolete inventory charges.\nOur business is both cyclical and seasonal and is subject to fluctuations in sales and net income.\nThe RV and marine industries have been characterized by cycles of growth and contraction in consumer demand, reflecting prevailing economic and demographic conditions, which affect disposable income for leisure-time activities. Consequently, the results for any prior period may not be indicative of results for any future period.\nSeasonal factors, over which we have no control, also have an effect on the demand for our products. Demand in the RV and marine industries generally declines over the winter season, while sales are generally highest during the spring and summer months. Also, unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand.\nOur business depends on the performance of independent dealers.\nWe distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers across the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We rely on our dealers to develop and implement effective strategies to create retail demand for our products. If our independent dealers are unsuccessful in doing so, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract new dealers and maintain relationships with existing dealers. Our independent dealers maintain control over which products they carry and choose to sell, and they may promote other products, or terminate existing relationships if our products are not perceived as being desirable and profitable. Our results of operations can be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with independent dealers.\nThe financial condition of independent dealers is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our control. Significant deterioration in the financial condition of independent dealers could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAn increase in dealer consolidation or the loss of a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn recent periods there has been an increase in acquisitions and consolidation across the U.S. RV independent dealer network. Although none of our dealer organizations accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues during each of the past three fiscal years, continued consolidation of independent dealers could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and our exposure to repurchase obligations. In addition, the loss of a significant dealer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of our products in the future than estimated due to dealer default, these purchases could result in adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn accordance with customary practice in our industries, upon request we enter into formal repurchase agreements with lending institutions financing a dealer's purchase of our products. In these repurchase agreements we agree, in the event of a default by an independent dealer in its obligation to a lender and repossession of the unit(s) by the lending institution, to repurchase units at declining prices over the term of the agreements, which can last up to 24 months. The difference between the gross repurchase price and the price at which the repurchased product can then be resold, which is typically at a discount to the gross repurchase price, represents a potential expense to us. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from our dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary terminations. If we are obligated to repurchase a substantially larger number of units in the future than we estimate, this would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nOperational Risks\nFor some of the components used in production, we depend on a small group of suppliers and the loss of any of these suppliers could affect our ability to obtain components timely or at competitive prices, which would decrease our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nMost of our RV and marine components are readily available from numerous sources. However, a few of our components are produced by a small group of suppliers. In Fiscal 2023, one of our suppliers individually accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated raw material purchases. In the case of motorhome RV chassis, Mercedes-Benz (USA and Canada), Stellantis N.V., Freightliner Trucks, Ford Motor Company, and Spartan RV Chassis are our major suppliers. Our relationship with our chassis suppliers is similar to our other supplier relationships in that no specific contractual commitments are engaged in by either party. This means that we do not have minimum purchase requirements, and our chassis suppliers do not have minimum supply requirements. Our chassis suppliers also supply to our competitors. Historically, chassis suppliers resort to an industry-wide allocation system during periods when supply is restricted. These allocations have been based on the volume of chassis previously purchased, which could mean our larger competitors could receive more chassis in a time of scarcity. Sales of motorhome RVs rely on chassis supply and are affected by shortages, instability, or recalls from time to time. For example, in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter chassis became subject to a recall notice, which temporarily suspended all retail sales and wholesale shipments of our products built on this chassis until a recall remedy was implemented. The remedy was implemented in the second quarter of Fiscal 2023 in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz AG. Within our marine businesses, we purchase a significant portion of our motors from Mercury Marine, which makes us reliant on them for the supply of these engines. If we experience delays and disruptions in obtaining these engines, we may be unable to fulfill orders and deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner. Furthermore, decisions by our suppliers to decrease production, production delays or work stoppages by the employees of such suppliers, or price increases could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our products and ultimately, on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. For example, on September 15, 2023, the United Auto Workers Union (\"UAW\") announced targeted strikes impacting certain auto manufacturers from which we purchase chassis. While we do not expect immediate disruption from the strike, the situation remains dynamic, and the exact magnitude and duration is difficult to predict at this time. However, if the labor disputes are prolonged, there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations are primarily centered in northern Iowa and northern Indiana. Any disruption or delay at our primary manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe currently manufacture most of our products in northern Iowa and northern Indiana. We also have relatively small manufacturing operations on the Gulf Coast of Florida. These facilities may be affected by natural or man-made disasters and other external events. In the event that one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a disaster or other event, we could be forced to shift production to one of our other manufacturing facilities or to cease operations. Although we maintain insurance for damage to our property and disruption of our business from casualties, such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses. Any disruption in our manufacturing capacity could have an adverse impact on our ability to produce sufficient inventory of our products or may require us to incur additional expenses in order to produce sufficient inventory, and therefore, may adversely affect our net sales and operating results. Any disruption or delay at our manufacturing facilities could impair our ability to meet the demands of our customers, and our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nUnanticipated changes to our dealer inventory levels could negatively impact our operating results.\nWe sell many of our products through our independent dealer network and are subject to risks relating to their inventory management decisions and operational and sourcing practices. Our dealers carry inventories of our products as part of their ongoing operations and adjust those inventories based on their assessments of future needs. Such adjustments may impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as operating results. If the inventory levels of our dealers are higher than they desire, they may postpone product purchases from us, which could cause our sales to be lower than the end-user retail demand for our products and negatively impact our inventory management and working capital goals as well as our operating results.\nIncreases in raw material, commodity, and transportation costs and shortages of certain raw materials could negatively impact our business.\nWe purchase raw materials such as steel, aluminum, and other commodities, and components, such as chassis, refrigerators, and televisions, for use in our products. In addition, we are a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities, including steel, aluminum, copper, lead, rubber, lumber, and others that are integrated into our end products. Our profitability is affected by significant fluctuations in the prices of the raw materials and the components and parts we use in our products. Additionally, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to the implementation of current trade regulations, future trade regulations and existing international trade agreements, which could continue to increase our cost of goods sold, both directly and as a result of price increases implemented by domestic suppliers, which we may not be able to pass on to our customers. The impact from these tariffs could also result in decreased demand for our products. All of these conditions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, increases in other costs of doing business may also adversely affect our profit margins and businesses. For example, an increase in fuel costs may result in an increase in our transportation costs, which also could adversely affect our operating results and businesses. Historically, we have mitigated cost increases, in part, by collaborating with suppliers, reviewing alternative sourcing options, substituting materials, engaging in internal cost reduction efforts, and increasing prices on some of our products, all as appropriate. However, we may not be able to fully offset such increased costs in the future. Further, if our price increases are not accepted by our customers and the market, our net sales, profit margins, earnings, and market share could be adversely affected.\nFailure to effectively manage strategic acquisitions and alliances, joint ventures, or partnerships could have a negative impact on our business.\nOne of our growth strategies is to drive growth through targeted acquisitions and alliances, stronger customer relations, and new joint ventures and partnerships that contribute profitable growth while supplementing our existing brands and product portfolio. Our ability to grow through acquisitions depends, in part, on the availability of suitable candidates at acceptable prices, terms, and conditions, our ability to compete effectively for acquisition candidates, and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and run the acquired business effectively. Any acquisition, alliance, joint venture, or partnership could impair our business, financial condition, reputation, and operating results. The benefits of an acquisition, or new alliance, joint venture, or partnership may take more time than expected to develop or integrate into our operations, and we cannot guarantee that previous or future acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, or partnerships will, in fact, produce any benefits. Such acquisitions, alliances, joint ventures, and partnerships may involve a number of risks, including:\nDiversion of managements attention;\nDisruption to our existing operations and plans;\nInability to effectively manage our expanded operations;\nDifficulties or delays in integrating and assimilating information and financial systems, operations, and products of an acquired business or other business venture or in realizing projected efficiencies, growth prospects, cost savings, and synergies;\nInability to successfully integrate or develop a distribution channel for acquired product lines;\nPotential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, or dealers of the acquired businesses or adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers, customers, distributors, and dealers;\nAdverse impact on overall profitability, if our expanded operations do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation model;\nInaccurate assessment of additional post-acquisition or business venture investments, undisclosed, contingent or other liabilities or problems, unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition or other business venture, and an inability to recover or manage such liabilities and costs; and\nIncorrect estimates made in the accounting for acquisitions, occurrence of non-recurring charges, and write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we fail to identify, attract, and retain appropriately qualified employees, including employees in key positions, our operations and profitability may be harmed. Changes in market compensation rates may adversely affect our profitability.\nOur ability to meet our strategic objectives and otherwise grow our business will depend to a significant extent on the continued contributions of our leadership team. Our future success will also depend in large part on our ability to identify, attract, and retain other highly qualified managerial, technical, sales and marketing, operations, and customer service personnel. Competition for these individuals in our manufacturing markets is intense, and supply is limited. Since we operate in a competitive labor market, there is a risk that market increases in compensation could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not succeed in identifying, attracting, or retaining qualified personnel on a cost-effective basis. The loss or interruption of services of any of our key personnel, inability to identify, attract, or retain qualified personnel in the future, delays in hiring qualified personnel, or any employee work slowdowns, strikes, or similar actions could make it difficult for us to conduct and manage our business and meet key objectives, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nSignificant product repair and/or replacement costs due to product warranty claims and product recalls could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe receive warranty claims from our dealers in the ordinary course of our business. Although we maintain reserves for such claims, which to date have been adequate, there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate. A significant increase in warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nInformation Systems, Legal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may be subject to information technology system failures, inefficiencies associated with system implementations, network disruptions, and breaches in data security that could adversely affect our business. Failure to prevent or effectively respond to a breach or system failure could expose our customers', clients', or suppliers' confidential information and expose us to substantial costs and reputational damage as well as litigation and enforcement actions.\nWe rely on our information systems and web applications to support our business operations, including but not limited to procurement, supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, warranty administration, invoicing, and collection of payments. We use information systems to record and report our operational results. Additionally, we rely upon information systems in our sales, marketing, human resources, and communication efforts. Due to our reliance on our information systems, our business processes may be negatively impacted in the event of substantial disruption of service. In addition, continued integration and development of new systems have resulted, and may in the future result in operational inefficiencies that adversely impact our results of operations. Further, we have security systems in place with the intent of maintaining the physical security of our facilities and protecting our customers', clients', and suppliers' confidential information and information related to identifiable individuals against unauthorized access through our information systems or by other electronic transmission or through the misdirection, theft, or loss of physical media. Misuse, leakage, falsification, or breach of security of information could result in a violation of privacy laws and damage our reputation which could, in turn, have a negative impact on our results. Because the technologies used to obtain unauthorized access are constantly changing and becoming increasingly more sophisticated and often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement sufficient preventative measures. If we fail to maintain or protect our information systems and web applications effectively, we could experience adverse consequences that could have a material effect on our business. Amongst other things, the impact could include interruptions or delays in our ability to access information, data loss, processing inefficiencies, lost revenues or other costs resulting from shutdowns, unfavorable publicity, governmental inquiry and oversight, difficulty in marketing our services, allegations by our customers and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations, litigation by affected parties, and possible financial obligations for damages related to the theft or misuse of such information.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of our brands which, if impaired, could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, if the frequency and size of product liability and other claims against us increase, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nWe believe that one of the strengths of our business is our brands, which are widely known around the world. We vigorously defend our brands and our other intellectual property rights against third parties on a global basis. We have, from time to time, had to bring claims against third parties to protect or prevent unauthorized use of our brand. If we are unable to protect and defend our brands or other intellectual property, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are also subject, in the ordinary course of business, to litigation including a variety of warranty, \"Lemon Law,\" and product liability claims typical in the RV and marine industries. Although we have an insurance policy covering product liability, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover all future claims against us, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any increase in the frequency and size of these claims, as compared to our experience in prior years, may cause the premium that we are required to pay for insurance to rise significantly. Product liability claims may also cause us to pay punitive damages, not all of which are covered by our insurance. In addition, if product liability claims rise to a level of frequency or size that are significantly higher than similar claims made against our competitors, our reputation and business may be harmed.\nWe are subject to certain government regulations that could have a material adverse impact on our business, including changing climate-related regulations that may require us to incur additional costs in order to be in compliance.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, and local regulations and the following summarizes some, but not all, of the laws and regulations that apply to us.\nFederal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards govern the design, manufacture and sale of our RV products, which standards are promulgated by the NHTSA. NHTSA requires manufacturers to recall and repair vehicles which are non-compliant with a Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard or contain safety defects. In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard maintains certification standards for the\nmanufacture of our marine products, and the safety of recreational boats in the U.S. is subject to federal regulation under the Boat Safety Act of 1971, which requires boat manufacturers to recall products for replacement of parts or components that have demonstrated defects affecting safety. Any major recalls of our products, voluntary or involuntary, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. While we believe we are in compliance with the foregoing laws and regulations as they currently exist, amendments to any of these regulations or the implementation of new regulations could significantly increase the cost of testing, manufacturing, purchasing, operating, or selling our products and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, our failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in federal fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of sales or production, or cessation of operations.\nWe are also subject to federal and numerous state consumer protection and unfair trade practice laws and regulations relating to the sale, transportation, and marketing of motor vehicles, including so-called \"Lemon Laws.\" Federal and state laws and regulations also impose upon vehicle operators various restrictions on the weight, length, and width of motor vehicles, including motorhome RVs that may be operated in certain jurisdictions or on certain roadways. Certain jurisdictions also prohibit the sale of vehicles exceeding length restrictions.\nFailure to comply with the New York Stock Exchange and SEC laws or regulations could also have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, amendments to these regulations and the implementation of new regulations could increase the cost of our operations and therefore could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe are subject to income and other tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we could be impacted by adjustments proposed by taxing authorities in connection with examinations, depending on their timing, nature and scope. Increases in tax rates, changes in tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material impact on our financial results.\nFinally, federal and state authorities also have various environmental control standards relating to air, water, noise pollution, greenhouse gases (\"GHG\"), and hazardous waste generation and disposal that affect us and our operations. Failure by us to comply with present or future laws and regulations could result in fines being imposed on us, potential civil and criminal liability, suspension of production or operations, alterations to the manufacturing process, or costly cleanup or capital expenditures, any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies have proposed various legislative and regulatory measures relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions, and energy policies. If such legislation is enacted, we could incur increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with the limitations. Climate change regulation combined with public sentiment could result in reduced demand for our products, higher fuel prices, or carbon taxes, all of which could materially adversely affect our business. Due to uncertainty in the regulatory and legislative processes, as well as the scope of such requirements and initiatives, we cannot currently determine the effect such legislation and regulation may have on our products and operations.\nOur ESG commitments may impact our reputation, expose us to additional costs, or have other impacts which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThere has been an increased focus from regulators, investors, employees, consumers, and other stakeholders relating to ESG practices. We periodically communicate our ESG initiatives, which include prioritizing ethics and integrity, safety, people, diversity, equity and inclusion, community, waste, emissions, and product stewardship. Failure to meet our commitments, respond to regulatory requirements, or advance our initiatives could adversely impact our reputation, as well as the demand for our products. In addition, achieving these initiatives may result in increased costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nFinancial Risks\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill and trade names could negatively impact our consolidated results of operations.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names in certain instances, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Our determination of whether goodwill impairment has occurred is based on a comparison of each of our reporting units fair value with its carrying value. Significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances, such as significant and long-term adverse changes in business climate, unanticipated competition, and/or changes in technology or markets, could require a provision for impairment in a future period that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe terms of our notes and other debt instruments could adversely affect our operating flexibility and pose risks of default.\nWe incurred substantial indebtedness to finance the acquisitions of Grand Design and Newmar Corporation (\"Newmar\"). Our asset based revolving credit facility (\"ABL Credit Facility\") and Senior Secured Notes (as described in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) are secured by substantially all of our assets, including cash, inventory, accounts receivable, and certain machinery and equipment. We also issued unsecured Convertible Notes (as described in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K) to finance the acquisition of Newmar. If a default of payment occurs, the lenders in our ABL Credit Facility or holders of our Senior Secured and Convertible Notes may elect to declare all of their respective outstanding debt, together with accrued interest and other amounts payable thereunder, to be immediately due and payable. Under such circumstances, we may not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. In addition, the limitations imposed on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other corporate actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nBorrowing availability under the ABL Credit Facility is limited to the lesser of the facility total and the calculated borrowing base, which is based on stipulated loan percentages applied to our eligible trade accounts receivable and eligible inventories. Should the borrowing base decline, our ability to borrow to fund future operations and business transactions could be limited.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Notes contain certain occurrence-based covenants that could restrict our ability to undertake certain types of transactions. If we enter into a transaction that falls under the occurrence-based covenants, we will calculate the ratios and covenant buckets we have available to us to ensure we are in compliance. Likewise, the indenture related to the Convertible Notes issued to help finance the acquisition of Newmar includes certain limited covenants that could impact our ability to operate our business.\nIn addition, our indebtedness could:\nMake us more vulnerable to general adverse economic, regulatory, and industry conditions;\nLimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes and opportunities in the markets in which we compete;\nPlace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt; and\nRestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or exploiting other business opportunities.

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot Applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol of WGO. As of October 12, 2023, there were 2,050 shareholders of record.\nDividends\nOn August 16, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.31 per share, totaling $9.2 million, to be paid on September 27, 2023 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on September 13, 2023. Dividends are generally declared each quarter, and the Board of Directors currently intends to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends; however, declaration of future dividends, if any, will be based on several factors including our financial performance, outlook, and liquidity.\nOur outstanding notes, as further described in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, contains restrictions that may limit our ability to pay dividends.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur ABL Credit Facility contains restrictions that may limit our ability to make distributions or payments with respect to purchases of our common stock without consent from the lenders, except for limited purchases of our common stock from employees, in the event of a significant reduction in our EBITDA or in the event of a significant borrowing on our ABL Credit Facility. Our Senior Secured Notes also contain covenants that may limit our ability to make distributions or payments with respect to purchases of our common stock. See additional information on our ABL Credit Facility and our Senior Secured Notes in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOn August 17, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $350.0 million with no time restriction on the authorization. This share repurchase program was effective immediately and replaced the prior program that was fully depleted in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nDuring Fiscal 2023, we repurchased approximately 795,000 shares of our common stock at a cost of $50.0 million, and approximately 90,000 shares of our common stock at a cost of $5.1 million to satisfy tax obligations on employee equity awards as they vested. We continually evaluate if share repurchases reflect a prudent use of our capital and, subject to compliance with our ABL Credit Facility and outstanding Senior Secured Notes, we may purchase shares in the future. As of August 26, 2023, we have $300.0 million remaining on our Board of Directors approved repurchase authorization.\nPurchases of our common stock during each fiscal month of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023 are as follows:\nPeriod Total Number of Shares Purchased(1,2)\nAverage Price Paid per Share Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs(1,2)\nApproximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs(3) (in millions)\n05/28/23 - 07/01/23 93,729 $ 64.09 93,606 $ 324.0\n07/02/23 - 07/29/23 281,394 67.56 281,209 305.0\n07/30/23 - 08/26/23 76,011 68.12 73,407 300.0\nTotal 451,134 $ 66.93 448,222 $ 300.0\n(1) Number of shares in the above table are shown in whole numbers.\n(2) Shares not purchased as part of a publicly announced program were repurchased from employees who vested in Company shares and elected to pay their payroll tax via the value of shares delivered as opposed to cash.\n(3) Pursuant to a $350.0 million share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors on August 17, 2022. There is no time restriction on this authorization.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe following graph compares our five-year cumulative total shareholder return (including reinvestment of dividends) with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, the Russell 3000 Recreational Vehicles and Boats Subsector Index, and the peer group used in previously filings, consisting of THOR Industries, Inc., Polaris Inc., and Brunswick Corporation. The Russell 3000 Recreational Vehicles and Boats Subsector Index replaces the peer group in this analysis and going forward, as it is a widely utilized industry index that is representative of our current business. It is assumed in the graph that $100 was invested in our common stock, in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index and in the stocks of the peer group companies on August 25, 2018 and that all dividends received within a quarter were reinvested in that quarter. In accordance with the guidelines of the SEC, the shareholder return for each entity in the peer group index has been weighted on the basis of market capitalization as of each annual measurement date set forth in the graph.\nBase Period\nCompany/Index August 25,\n2018 August 31,\n2019 August 29,\n2020 August 28,\n2021 August 27,\n2022 August 26,\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. $ 100.00 $ 86.98 $ 160.25 $ 202.11 $ 171.27 $ 181.21\nS&P 500 Index 100.00 103.93 126.99 165.71 151.34 167.15\nRussell 3000 Recreational Vehicles and Boats Subsector Index 100.00 72.24 105.12 134.70 121.12 120.10\nPeer Group 100.00 68.41 103.66 139.25 115.72 123.13\nSource: Zacks Investment Research, Inc. Item 6. [Reserved]. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and certain other factors that may affect our future results. Unless otherwise noted, transactions and other factors significantly impacting our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity are discussed in order of magnitude. Our MD&A is presented in five sections:\nOverview\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Financial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nOur MD&A should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe year-over-year comparisons in this MD&A are as of and for the fiscal years ended August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, unless stated otherwise. The discussion of Fiscal 2021 results and related year-over-year comparisons as of and for the fiscal years ended August 27, 2022 and August 28, 2021 are found in Item 7 of Part II of our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022.\nOverview\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. is one of the leading North American manufacturers of recreation vehicles (\"RVs\") and marine products with a diversified portfolio used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreational activities. We also design and manufacture advanced battery solutions that deliver house power, supporting internal electrical features and appliances for a variety of outdoor products including RVs, boats, specialty and other low-speed vehicles, as well as other industrial applications. We produce our motorhome RV units in Iowa and Indiana; our towable RV units in Indiana; and our marine units in Indiana and Florida. We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers across the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Our battery solutions are primarily sold to customers in the U.S.\nChange in Presentation\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we changed our presentation in tables from thousands to millions, unless otherwise designated. As a result, certain rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, certain prior period amounts may not recalculate due to rounding. These changes were not significant, and no other updates were made to previously reported financial information.\nKnown Trends and Uncertainties\nOur business continues to be challenged by macroeconomic conditions impacting retail consumers, such as inflation and rising interest rates. These factors have contributed to lower consumer spending and reduced short-term demand for large discretionary products such as RVs and marine products. In the fourth quarter of 2023, these trends resulted in decreased sales due to declines in unit volume associated with the retail market conditions and a cautious dealer network. In response, we are working closely with dealer partners across all our segments to align field inventory levels to meet end consumer demand. We anticipate that as field inventory levels further normalize and consumer demand stabilizes, dealers will exhibit a growing willingness to replenish inventories in the second half of Fiscal 2024. We continue to produce and ship in accordance with dealer demand as evidenced and requested by dealer orders.\nDespite the current economic uncertainty, we believe in the long-term health of consumer demand for RV and marine products.\nOther Matters\nOn September 15, 2023, the UAW announced targeted strikes impacting certain auto manufacturers from which we purchase chassis. While we do not expect immediate disruption from the strike, the situation remains dynamic, and the exact magnitude and duration is difficult to predict at this time. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, Mercedes-Benz AG issued a global recall related to an electronic parking brake defect affecting 2019 through 2022 Sprinter chassis. As a result, all retail sales and wholesale shipments of our products built on this chassis were temporarily suspended until a recall remedy was implemented. During the second quarter of Fiscal 2023, the recall remedy was implemented in cooperation with Mercedes-Benz AG. This recall impacted our Motorhome RV segment net sales and profitability in Fiscal 2023.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThis MD&A includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), as well as certain adjusted or non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other pretax adjustments made in order to present comparable results from period to period.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, have been provided as information supplemental and in addition to the financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for, or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. The non-GAAP financial measures presented may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\nIncluded in \"Results of Operations - Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\" is a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA from net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure. We have included these non-GAAP performance measures as a comparable measure to illustrate the effect of non-recurring transactions that occurred during the reported periods and to improve comparability of our results from period to period. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance as this measure excludes amounts from net income that we do not consider part of our core operating results when assessing our performance. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include acquisition-related costs, litigation reserves, restructuring expenses, gain or loss on property, plant, and equipment, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, and non-operating income or loss.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance and trends as well as our performance relative to competitors and peers; (b) to measure operational profitability on a consistent basis; (c) in presentations to the members of our Board of Directors to enable our Board of Directors to have the same measurement basis of operating performance as used by management in its assessments of performance and in forecasting; (d) to evaluate potential acquisitions; and (e) to ensure compliance with covenants and restricted activities under the terms of our ABL Credit Facility and outstanding notes, as further described in Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the industry.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nConsolidated Performance Summary\nThe following is an analysis of changes in key items included in the statements of operations for the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023 compared to the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022:\n(in millions, except per share data) 2023 % of Revenues(1)\n2022 % of Revenues(1)\n$ Change(1)\n% Change(1)\nNet revenues $ 3,490.7 100.0 % $ 4,957.7 100.0 % $ (1,467.1) (29.6) %\nCost of goods sold 2,904.6 83.2 % 4,028.4 81.3 % (1,123.8) (27.9) %\nGross profit 586.1 16.8 % 929.3 18.7 % (343.3) (36.9) %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") 267.7 7.7 % 316.4 6.4 % (48.7) (15.4) %\nAmortization 17.7 0.5 % 29.4 0.6 % (11.7) (39.8) %\nTotal operating expenses 285.4 8.2 % 345.8 7.0 % (60.5) (17.5) %\nOperating income 300.7 8.6 % 583.5 11.8 % (282.8) (48.5) %\nInterest expense, net 20.5 0.6 % 41.3 0.8 % (20.7) (50.1) %\nNon-operating loss 1.0 - % 27.5 0.6 % (26.5) (96.5) %\nIncome before income taxes 279.2 8.0 % 514.7 10.4 % (235.6) (45.8) %\nProvision for income taxes 63.3 1.8 % 124.1 2.5 % (60.8) (49.0) %\nNet income $ 215.9 6.2 % $ 390.6 7.9 % $ (174.8) (44.7) %\nDiluted earnings per share $ 6.23 $ 11.84 $ (5.61) (47.4) %\nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding 35.4 33.0 2.5 7.5 %\n(1) Amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate using the rounded numbers provided.

The decrease is primarily driven by lower profitability adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by net favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. The favorable impact of operating assets and liabilities is primarily due to changes in accounts receivable due to lower sales and timing of invoicing/collections, and changes in inventory due to elevated purchases in Fiscal 2022 to support customer demand, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable due to lower purchasing requirements.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities decreased in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 primarily due to our acquisition of Barletta during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 compared to the acquisition of Lithionics during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities decreased in Fiscal 2023 compared to Fiscal 2022 primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases in Fiscal 2023.\nDebt and Capital\nWe maintain a $350.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (\"ABL Credit Facility\") with a maturity date of July 15, 2027 subject to certain factors which may accelerate the maturity date. As of August 26, 2023, we had $309.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings against the ABL Credit Facility. Our cash and cash equivalent balances consist of high quality, short-term money market instruments.\nOn July 8, 2020, we closed our private offering (the Senior Secured Notes Offering) of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Senior Secured Notes).\nOn November 1, 2019, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5% unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (Convertible Notes), which were used to partially fund the Newmar acquisition.\nWe continue to evaluate the financial stability of the counterparties and counterparty risk for the Convertible Notes, the Senior Secured Notes, and the ABL Credit Facility.\nRefer to Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nOther Financial Measures\nWorking capital as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022 was $600.7 million and $571.7 million, respectively.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe anticipate capital expenditures in Fiscal 2024 of approximately $60.0 million to $80.0 million. We will continue to support organic growth through facility improvements to benefit a safer operating environment, operational improvements, and investments in software and our digital capabilities. We believe cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and the borrowing capacity available under our ABL Credit Facility and other debt instruments will be sufficient to support our capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.\nShare Repurchases and Dividends\nWe repurchase our common stock and pay dividends pursuant to programs approved by our Board of Directors. Our long-term capital allocation strategy is to first fund operations and investments in growth, maintain reasonable liquidity, maintain a leverage ratio that reflects a prudent capital structure in light of the cyclical industries we compete in, and then return excess cash over time\nto shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Refer to Item 5 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion about our share repurchase program and dividend declared on August 16, 2023.\nCash Requirements\nOur cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable, accrued expenses, purchase commitments and other current liabilities.\nOur cash requirements greater than twelve months from various contractual obligations and commitments include:\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments\nRefer to Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our debt and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. Interest payments are based on fixed interest rates for the Senior Secured Notes and Convertible Notes.\nOperating and Finance Leases\nRefer to Note 10 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our lease obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\nDeferred Compensation Obligations\nRefer to Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our deferred compensation plans. We expect to pay $1.8 million in the next 12 months and $7.9 million beyond 12 months.\nContracted Services\nContracted services include agreements with third-party service providers primarily for software, payroll services, and equipment maintenance services for periods up to Fiscal 2026. We expect to pay approximately $16.8 million in the next 12 months and approximately $26.2 million beyond 12 months.\nContingent Repurchase Obligations\nRefer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our contingent repurchase commitment and estimated obligation, most of which we expect to expire within one year.\nWe expect to satisfy our short-term and long-term obligations through a combination of cash on hand, funds generated from operations, and the borrowing capacity available under our ABL Credit Facility and other debt instruments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors believed to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur critical accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.\nWe have not made any material changes during the past three fiscal years, nor do we believe there is a reasonable likelihood of a material future change to the accounting methodologies for the areas described below.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. This method requires the recording of acquired assets, including separately identifiable intangible assets, and assumed liabilities at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash flows, discount rates, royalty rates and asset lives, among other items.\nWe used the income approach to value certain intangible assets. Under the income approach, an intangible assets fair value is equal to the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of the asset. We used the income approach known as the relief from royalty method to value the fair value of the trade names. The relief from royalty method is based on the hypothetical royalty stream that would be received if we were to license the trade name and was based on expected revenues. The fair value of the dealer network was estimated using an income approach known as the cost to recreate/cost savings method. This method uses the replacement of the asset as an indicator of the fair value of the asset. The determination of the fair value of other assets acquired and liabilities assumed involves assessing factors such as the expected future cash flows associated with individual assets and liabilities and appropriate discount rates at the date of the acquisition.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets (trade names in certain instances) for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter and more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would indicate a reduction in fair value. Our test of impairment begins by either performing a qualitative evaluation or a quantitative test:\nQualitative evaluation - Performed to determine whether it is more likely than not that the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived trade name exceeds the fair value of the asset. During our qualitative assessment, we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including, but not limited to, the macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance of the Company and the reporting units, changes in our share price, and relevant company-specific events. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived trade name exceeds the fair value, we perform the quantitative test to determine the amount of the impairment.\nQuantitative test - Used to calculate the fair value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived trade name. If the carrying value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived trade name exceeds the fair value, the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and fair value. Our goodwill fair value model uses a blend of the income (discounted future cash flow) and market (guideline public company) approaches, which includes the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). Our indefinite-lived trade name fair value model uses the income (relief-from-royalty) approach, which includes the use of significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). During these valuations, we make significant estimates, assumptions, and judgments, including current and projected future levels of income based on managements plans, business trends, market and economic conditions, and market-participant considerations.\nActual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. No impairments were recorded in Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021. For further information regarding goodwill and intangible assets, see Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWarranty\nWe provide certain service and warranty on our products. Estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and are based upon past warranty claims and unit sales history. Estimates are adjusted as needed to reflect actual costs incurred as information becomes available.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on our products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nA significant increase in dealership labor rates, the cost of parts, or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize. A hypothetical change of a 10% increase or decrease in our warranty liability as of August 26, 2023 would not have a material effect on our net income.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a summary of new applicable accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe assets we maintain to fund deferred compensation have market risk, but we maintain a corresponding liability for these assets. The market risk is therefore borne by the participants in the deferred compensation program.\nInterest Rate Risk\nThe ABL Credit Facility is our only floating rate debt instrument, which remains undrawn as of August 26, 2023. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nWe, the management of Winnebago Industries, Inc. (the \"Company\") are responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for the assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company's internal control over financial reporting is supported by written policies and procedures that:\n1.pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company's assets;\n2.provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and\n3.provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nIn addition, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting solely of independent directors, meets periodically with management of the Company, the internal auditors, and the independent registered public accounting firm to review internal accounting controls, audit results, and accounting principles and practices and annually selects the independent registered public accounting firm.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nIn connection with the preparation of the Company's annual financial statements, management of the Company has undertaken an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on its assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 26, 2023.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company's financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued a report included herein, which expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n/s/ Michael J. Happe /s/ Bryan L. Hughes\nMichael J. Happe Bryan L. Hughes\nPresident, Chief Executive Officer Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nOctober 18, 2023 October 18, 2023\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Winnebago Industries, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Winnebago Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of August 26, 2023, and August 27, 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended August 26, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 26, 2023, and August 27, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 26, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October 18, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProduct Warranties - Grand Design - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company provides certain service and warranty on its products. Estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at month-end based upon historical warranty claims and unit sales history. Estimates are adjusted as needed to reflect actual costs incurred as information becomes available. Grand Design RV, LLC (Grand Design) was founded in 2013 and acquired by the Company in November 2016 and makes up the majority of the Companys $98 million product warranty accrual as of August 26, 2023.\nWe identified the product warranty accrual for Grand Design as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgments made by management to estimate costs related to product warranties at the time of sale. This required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates of future warranty claims based on historical claims paid, specifically due to Grand Designs significant growth since inception, introduction of new product lines, and relatively short history of warranty claims paid from which to develop product warranty estimates.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the product warranty for the Grand Design component included the following, among others:\nWe evaluated the operating effectiveness of controls over managements estimation of the product warranty accrual, including those over historical product warranty claim data and projected future product warranty claims.\nWe evaluated the accuracy and relevance of the historical product warranty claims as an input to managements product warranty accrual calculation.\nWe evaluated the completeness of the warranty accrual estimate through inquiries of operational and executive management regarding knowledge of known product warranty claims or product issues and evaluated whether they were appropriately considered in the determination of the product warranty accrual.\nWe evaluated managements ability to accurately estimate the warranty accrual by comparing the product warranty accrual in prior years to the actual product warranty claims paid in subsequent years.\nWe assessed managements methodology and tested the valuation of the product warranty accrual by developing an expectation for the accrual based on changes in units in warranty and warranty claims paid and compared our expectation to the amount recorded by management.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nOctober 18, 2023\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since fiscal 1986.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Winnebago Industries, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Winnebago Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 26, 2023, of the Company and our report dated October 18, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\nOctober 18, 2023\nWinnebago Industries, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(in millions, except per share data)\nFor the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022 August 28, 2021\nNet revenues $ 3,490.7 $ 4,957.7 $ 3,629.8\nCost of goods sold 2,904.6 4,028.4 2,979.4\nGross profit 586.1 929.3 650.4\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses 267.7 316.4 228.6\nAmortization 17.7 29.4 14.4\nTotal operating expenses 285.4 345.8 243.0\nOperating income 300.7 583.5 407.4\nInterest expense, net 20.5 41.3 40.4\nNon-operating loss (income) 1.0 27.5 (0.5)\nIncome before income taxes 279.2 514.7 367.5\nProvision for income taxes 63.3 124.1 85.6\nNet income $ 215.9 $ 390.6 $ 281.9\nEarnings per common share:\nBasic $ 7.12 $ 12.03 $ 8.41\nDiluted $ 6.23 $ 11.84 $ 8.28\nWeighted average common shares outstanding:\nBasic 30.3 32.5 33.5\nDiluted 35.4 33.0 34.1\nThe accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nWinnebago Industries, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in millions, except per share data)\nAugust 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nAssets\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 309.9 $ 282.2\nReceivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts ($0.4 and $0.6, respectively)\n178.5 254.1\nInventories, net 470.6 525.8\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 37.7 31.7\nTotal current assets 996.7 1,093.8\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net 327.3 276.2\nGoodwill 514.5 484.2\nOther intangible assets, net 502.0 472.4\nInvestment in life insurance 29.3 28.6\nOperating lease assets 42.6 41.1\nOther long-term assets 20.0 20.4\nTotal assets $ 2,432.4 $ 2,416.7\nLiabilities and Shareholders' Equity\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 146.9 $ 217.5\nIncome taxes payable - 0.7\nAccrued expenses:\nAccrued compensation 35.9 71.6\nProduct warranties 97.8 127.9\nSelf-insurance 23.3 21.4\nPromotional 29.9 21.5\nAccrued interest and dividends 13.7 13.0\nOther current liabilities 48.5 48.5\nTotal current liabilities 396.0 522.1\nNon-current liabilities\nLong-term debt, net 592.4 545.9\nDeferred income tax liabilities, net 11.7 6.1\nUnrecognized tax benefits 6.1 5.7\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 42.0 40.4\nDeferred compensation benefits, net of current portion 7.9 8.1\nOther long-term liabilities 8.2 25.4\nTotal liabilities 1,064.3 1,153.7\nContingent liabilities and commitments (Note 12)\nShareholders' equity\nPreferred stock, par value $0.01: 10.0 shares authorized;

Basis of Presentation\nNature of Operations\nWinnebago Industries, Inc. is one of the leading North American manufacturers of recreation vehicles (\"RVs\") and marine products with a diversified portfolio used primarily in leisure travel and outdoor recreational activities. We produce our motorhome RV units in Iowa and Indiana; our towable RV units in Indiana; and our marine units in Indiana and Florida. We distribute our RV and marine products primarily through independent dealers throughout the U.S. and Canada, who then retail the products to the end consumer. We also distribute our marine products internationally through independent dealers, who then retail the products to the end consumer. Other products manufactured by us consist primarily of original equipment manufacturing parts for other manufacturers and commercial vehicles.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Winnebago Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The use of the terms \"Winnebago Industries,\" \"Winnebago,\" \"we,\" \"our,\" and \"us\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, refer to Winnebago Industries, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nFiscal Period\nWe have a 5-4-4 quarterly accounting cycle with the fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in August. Fiscal 2023 refers to the fiscal year ended August 26, 2023, Fiscal 2022 refers to the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, and Fiscal 2021 refers to the fiscal year ended August 28, 2021. The financial statements presented are all 52-week fiscal periods.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (\"GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting years. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents represent cash, demand deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are not legally restricted. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\nReceivables\nReceivables consist principally of amounts due from our dealer network for RVs and boats sold.\nWe record an allowance using a model to reduce receivables by the expected credit loss and consider factors such as financial condition of the dealer, specific collection issues, current and expected economic conditions, and other factors that may impact our ability to collect. If there is a deterioration of a dealer's financial condition, if we become aware of additional information related to credit worthiness, or if future actual default rates on receivables differ from those currently anticipated, we may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts, which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made.\nInventories\nGenerally, inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined under the First-in, First-out basis (\"FIFO\"), except for the Winnebago Motorhome operating segment which is determined using the Last-in, First-out (\"LIFO\") basis. Manufacturing cost includes materials, labor, and overhead. Unallocated overhead and abnormal costs are expensed as incurred.\nProperty and Equipment\nDepreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight-line method on the cost of the assets, less allowance for salvage value where appropriate, at rates based upon their estimated service lives as follows:\nAsset Class Asset Life\nBuildings and improvements 5-30 years\nMachinery and equipment 5-8 years\nSoftware 3-10 years\nTransportation equipment 5-6 years\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level and all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit. Our reporting units are the same as the operating segments as defined in Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred, we then perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. We also generally perform a quantitative impairment test of our reporting units at least once every five years. If we perform the quantitative test, the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of the reporting units fair value to identify impairment. The estimate of the reporting units fair value involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). The fair value is determined by a blend of the income approach (discounted future cash flow) and market approach (guideline public company) using current industry information. In determining the estimated future cash flow, we consider and apply certain estimates and judgments, including current and projected future levels of income based on management plans, business trends, prospects, market and economic conditions, and market-participant considerations. If the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment fails, an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value will be recognized.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed the annual goodwill impairment analysis. We elected to rely on a qualitative assessment for the Grand Design, Chris-Craft, Barletta, and Lithionics reporting units, and performed a quantitative analysis for the Newmar reporting unit. No impairment was identified for the years ended August 26, 2023, August 27, 2022, or August 28, 2021.\nTrade names\nWe have indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Newmar trade name within the Motorhome RV segment, the Grand Design trade name within the Towable RV segment, and the Chris-Craft and Barletta trade names within the Marine segment. We also have a finite-lived trade name intangible asset related to Lithionics within Corporate / All Other. Annually in the fourth quarter, or if conditions indicate an interim review is necessary, we test indefinite-lived trade names for impairment. We have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the fair value of a trade name is more likely than not less than its carrying value. If it is more likely than not that an impairment has occurred, we then perform the quantitative impairment test. If we perform the quantitative test, the carrying value of the asset is compared to an estimate of its fair value to identify impairment. The fair value is determined by the relief-from-royalty method, which requires significant judgment. Actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts utilized in the analysis. If we conclude an impairment exists, the asset's carrying value will be written down to its fair value.\nDuring the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, we completed the annual impairment analysis for indefinite-lived intangible assets. We elected to rely on a qualitative assessment for the Grand Design, Chris-Craft, and Barletta trade names, and performed a quantitative analysis for the Newmar trade name. No impairment was identified for the years ended August 26, 2023, August 27, 2022, or August 28, 2021.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets, which include property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization, and right-of-use assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances such as asset utilization, physical change, legal factors or other matters indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment test involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset. These assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed and estimated amounts. In the event the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset and the carrying amount is not considered recoverable, an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the assets carrying amount over its fair value and is recognized in the statement of income in the period that the impairment occurs. The reasonableness of the useful lives of the asset and other long-lived assets is regularly evaluated.\nNo impairment loss of any long-lived asset was identified for the years ended August 26, 2023, August 27, 2022, or August 28, 2021.\nSelf-Insurance\nGenerally, we self-insure a portion of health insurance, product liability claims, and workers' compensation. Under these plans, liabilities are recognized for claims incurred, including those incurred but not reported. We use third-party administrators and actuaries who use historical claims experience and various state statutes to assist in the determination of the accrued liability balance. We review the valuations provided by the third-party administrators and actuaries to determine the adequacy of the reserves. We have a $75.0 million insurance policy that includes a self-insured retention for product liability of $1.0 million per occurrence and $2.0 million in aggregate per policy year. Our self-insured health insurance policy includes an individual retention of $0.5 million per occurrence. We maintain excess liability insurance with outside insurance carriers to minimize the risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of self-insured positions for product liability, health insurance, and personal injury matters. Any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on operating results. Balances are included within self-insurance (accrued expenses) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIncome Taxes\nIn preparing these financial statements, we are required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process involves estimating the current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income and, to the extent that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period, an expense or a benefit is included within the tax provision on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nLegal\nLitigation expense, including estimated defense costs, is recorded when probable and reasonably estimable.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary source of revenue is generated through the sale of non-motorized towable RV units, motorhome RV units, and marine units to our independent dealer network (customers). Unit revenue is recognized at a point-in-time when the performance obligation is satisfied and control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the unit is shipped to or picked-up from the manufacturing facilities by the customer. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of, the remaining benefits from the goods or services. We recognize revenue based on an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed as variable consideration. The amount of consideration received and recorded to revenue can vary with changes in marketing incentives and discounts offered to customers. These marketing incentives and discounts are considered variable consideration. We adjust the estimate of revenue at the earlier of when the most likely amount of consideration expected to be received changes or when the consideration becomes fixed. Our payment terms are typically before or on delivery, and do not include a significant financing component.\nNet revenue includes shipping and handling charges billed directly to customers, and we also generate income through the sale of certain parts and services, acting as the principal in these arrangements. We have made an accounting policy election to account for any shipping and handling costs that occur after the transfer of control as a fulfillment cost that is accrued when control is transferred. We also have made an accounting policy election to exclude from revenue sales and usage-based taxes collected.\nOur contracts include some incidental items that are immaterial in the context of the contract. We have made an accounting policy election to not assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract with the customer. Warranty obligations associated with the sale of a unit are assurance-type warranties that are a guarantee of the units intended functionality and, therefore, do not represent a distinct performance obligation within the context of the contract. Contract costs incurred related to the sale of manufactured units are expensed at the point-in-time when the related revenue is recognized.\nThe revenue standard requirements are applied to a portfolio of contracts (or performance obligations) with similar characteristics for transactions where it is expected that the effects on the financial statements of applying the revenue recognition guidance to the portfolio would not differ materially from applying this guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio.\nRefer to Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs, which consist primarily of trade shows and online content, were $21.3 million, $23.3 million, and $11.6 million in Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Advertising costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nChange in Presentation\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we changed our presentation in tables from thousands to millions, unless otherwise designated. As a result, certain rounding adjustments have been made to prior period disclosed amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, certain prior period amounts may not recalculate due to rounding. These changes were not significant, and no other updates were made to previously reported financial information.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income represents the change in stockholders equity from transactions and other events and circumstances from sources other than shareholders. The difference between comprehensive income and net income was not material for the years ended August 26, 2023, August 27, 2022, and August 28, 2021.\nSubsequent Events\nIn preparing the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we have evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through the date of this filing noting no material subsequent events.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) which reduces the number of models used to account for convertible instruments, amends diluted earnings per share (\"EPS\") calculations for convertible instruments, and amends the requirements for a contract (or embedded derivative) that is potentially settled in an entity's own shares to be classified in equity. Certain disclosure requirements were also added to increase transparency and decision-usefulness regarding a convertible instrument's terms and features. Additionally, the if-converted method must be used for including convertible instruments in diluted EPS as opposed to the treasury stock method. We adopted the new guidance in the first quarter of Fiscal 2023 using the modified retrospective approach, resulting in a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $62.0 million, an increase to long-term debt of $43.8 million, a decrease in the deferred income tax liability of $10.8 million, and an increase to beginning retained earnings of $29.0 million. In addition, the adoption of the amended guidance reduced our non-cash interest expense in Fiscal 2023 by $15.1 million (pre-tax). We will prospectively utilize the if-converted method to calculate the impact of our convertible instruments on diluted EPS. Under the if-converted method, the amount of shares underlying our convertible instruments are assumed to have been outstanding at the beginning of the reporting period, and any interest expense related to these instruments is excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS. Refer to Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the change from the treasury stock method to the if-converted method.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have reviewed all recently issued accounting pronouncements and concluded that such standards were either not applicable or not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2. Business Combinations\nLithionics Battery, LLC\nOn April 28, 2023, we purchased 100% of the equity interests of Lithionics Battery, LLC and Lithionics LLC (collectively, \"Lithionics\"), a premier lithium-ion battery solutions provider to the recreational equipment and specialty vehicle markets. Refer to Note 7 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information relating to the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented as the impact on our consolidated financial statements was not material.\nTotal transaction costs related to the Lithionics acquisition of $3.1 million were expensed during the third quarter of Fiscal 2023. Transaction costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nBarletta Boat Company, LLC\nOn August 31, 2021, we purchased 100% of the equity interests of Barletta Boat Company, LLC and Three Limes, LLC (collectively, \"Barletta\"), a manufacturer of high-quality, premium pontoon boats that are sold through a network of independent authorized dealers.\nWe acquired Barletta for a purchase price of $286.3 million, including cash payments of $240.1 million, $25.0 million in common stock issued to the sellers (subject to a discount noted below), and contingent consideration from earnout provisions. The common stock fair value included in the purchase price reflects a 12% discount, due to the lack of marketability as these are unregistered shares that have a one-year lockup restriction, which reduced the value of the common stock to $22.0 million. The contingent consideration includes both a potential stock payout as well as a potential cash payment based on achievement of certain financial performance metrics over the next few years. The maximum payout under the earnout is $50.0 million in cash and $15.0 million in stock if all metrics are achieved. The fair value of the earnout as of August 31, 2021 was $24.2 million. As of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, the fair value of the earnout was $18.4 million and $39.8 million, respectively. The portion of the earnout liability that will be settled within a year was included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the remaining earnout liability was included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of August 26, 2023, the entire $18.4 million was included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Comparatively, as of August 27, 2022, $21.3 million was included in other current liabilities and $18.5 million was included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2023, we paid $22.0 million to settle earnout obligations associated with the 2022 cash consideration earnout period. In the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we issued 0.2 million shares of common stock in connection with the settlement of the 2021 earnout period obligation.\nThe total purchase price was allocated to the acquired net tangible and intangible assets of Barletta, based on their preliminary fair values at the date of the acquisition. We finalized the allocation of the purchase price in the third quarter of Fiscal 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values assigned to the Barletta net assets acquired as of the date of acquisition:\n(in millions) August 31, 2021\nCash $ 11.9\nOther current assets 24.6\nProperty, plant, and equipment 17.3\nGoodwill 136.1\nOther intangible assets 111.4\nTotal assets acquired 301.3\nAccounts payable 7.2\nProduct warranties 4.7\nOther current liabilities 3.1\nTotal liabilities assumed 15.0\nTotal purchase price $ 286.3\nGoodwill from the Barletta acquisition is recognized in our Marine segment. The other intangible assets acquired include a trade name, dealer network, and backlog. The trade name has an indefinite life, while the dealer network is being amortized on a straight line basis over 12 years. The backlog, which was being amortized over 10 months, was fully amortized as of August 27, 2022.\nTotal transaction costs related to the Barletta acquisition were $3.1 million, of which $2.4 million were expensed during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022 and $0.7 million were expensed during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021. Transaction costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income.\nPro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented as they were immaterial to the reported results.\nNote 3. Business Segments\nWe have eight operating segments: 1) Grand Design towables, 2) Winnebago towables, 3) Winnebago motorhomes, 4) Newmar motorhomes, 5) Chris-Craft marine, 6) Barletta marine, 7) Winnebago specialty vehicles, and 8) Lithionics. Financial performance is evaluated based on each operating segment's Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\"), as defined below, which excludes certain corporate administration expenses and non-operating income and expense.\nOur three reportable segments are: Towable RV (an aggregation of the Grand Design towables and the Winnebago towables operating segments), Motorhome RV (an aggregation of the Winnebago motorhomes and Newmar motorhomes operating segments), and Marine (an aggregation of the Chris-Craft marine and Barletta marine operating segments). Towable RV is comprised of non-motorized RV products that are generally towed by another vehicle, along with other related manufactured products and services. Motorhome RV is comprised of products that include a motorhome chassis, along with other related manufactured products and services. Marine is comprised of products that include boats, along with other related manufactured products and services.\nThe Corporate / All Other category includes the Winnebago specialty vehicles and Lithionics operating segments as well as certain corporate administration expenses related to the oversight of the enterprise, such as corporate leadership and administration costs.\nIdentifiable assets of the reportable segments exclude general corporate assets, which principally consist of cash and cash equivalents and certain deferred tax balances. The general corporate assets are included in the Corporate / All Other category.\nOur Chief Executive Officer (the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\")) regularly reviews consolidated financial results in their entirety and operating segment financial information through Adjusted EBITDA and has ultimate responsibility for enterprise decisions. Our CODM is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the consolidated enterprise, reportable segments and between operating segments. Management of each operating segment has responsibility for operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance within their respective operating segment. The accounting policies of all reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe monitor and evaluate operating performance of our reportable segments based on Adjusted EBITDA. We believe disclosing Adjusted EBITDA is useful to securities analysts, investors and other interested parties when evaluating companies in our industries. EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, and depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, and other pretax adjustments made in order to present comparable results period over period. Examples of items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA include acquisition-related costs, litigation reserves, restructuring expenses, gain or loss on property, plant, and equipment, contingent consideration fair value adjustment, and non-operating income or loss.\nFinancial information by reportable segment is as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Revenues\nTowable RV $ 1,415.3 $ 2,597.4 $ 2,010.0\nMotorhome RV 1,560.1 1,911.2 1,539.1\nMarine 469.7 425.3 60.2\nCorporate / All Other 45.6 23.8 20.5\nConsolidated $ 3,490.7 $ 4,957.7 $ 3,629.8\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTowable RV $ 172.1 $ 383.6 $ 289.0\nMotorhome RV 142.0 238.0 169.2\nMarine 60.5 60.8 5.2\nCorporate / All Other (19.9) (33.5) (27.3)\nConsolidated $ 354.7 $ 648.9 $ 436.1\nCapital Expenditures\nTowable RV $ 25.6 $ 45.7 $ 25.1\nMotorhome RV 31.1 22.3 17.6\nMarine 19.1 16.4 2.2\nCorporate / All Other 7.4 3.6 -\nConsolidated $ 83.2 $ 88.0 $ 44.9\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nTotal Assets\nTowable RV $ 751.2 $ 874.9\nMotorhome RV 802.2 823.4\nMarine 426.9 416.1\nCorporate / All Other 452.1 302.3\nConsolidated $ 2,432.4 $ 2,416.7\nReconciliation of net income to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet income $ 215.9 $ 390.6 $ 281.9\nInterest expense, net 20.5 41.3 40.4\nProvision for income taxes 63.3 124.1 85.6\nDepreciation 29.2 24.2 18.2\nAmortization 17.7 29.4 14.4\nEBITDA 346.6 609.6 440.5\nAcquisition-related costs 7.5 5.2 0.7\nLitigation reserves (0.4) 6.6 -\nRestructuring expenses - - 0.1\nGain on sale of property, plant and equipment - - (4.8)\nContingent consideration fair value adjustment 0.6 29.4 -\nNon-operating loss (income) 0.4 (1.9) (0.4)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 354.7 $ 648.9 $ 436.1\nNet revenues by geography are as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nUnited States $ 3,346.6 $ 4,618.1 $ 3,410.6\nInternational 144.1 339.6 219.2\nNet revenues $ 3,490.7 $ 4,957.7 $ 3,629.8\nNote 4. Investments and Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nIn determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, we utilize market data or other assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market and adjusts for non-performance and/or other risks associated with us as well as counterparties, as appropriate. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible at the measurement date.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:\nFair Value at Fair Value Hierarchy\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets that fund deferred compensation:\nDomestic equity funds $ 1.7 $ 1.7 $ - $ -\nInternational equity funds 0.1 0.1 - -\nTotal assets at fair value $ 1.8 $ 1.8 $ - $ -\nContingent consideration\nEarnout liability 18.4 - - 18.4\nTotal liabilities at fair value $ 18.4 $ - $ - $ 18.4\nFair Value at Fair Value Hierarchy\n(in millions) August 27, 2022 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets that fund deferred compensation:\nDomestic equity funds $ 1.2 $ 1.2 $ - $ -\nInternational equity funds 0.1 0.1 - -\nFixed income funds 0.1 0.1 - -\nTotal assets at fair value $ 1.4 $ 1.4 $ - $ -\nContingent consideration\nEarnout liability 39.8 - - 39.8\nTotal liabilities at fair value $ 39.8 $ - $ - $ 39.8\nAssets that Fund Deferred Compensation\nOur assets that fund deferred compensation are marketable equity securities measured at fair value using quoted market prices and primarily consist of equity-based mutual funds. These securities, used to fund the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, are classified as Level 1 as they are traded in an active market for which closing stock prices are readily available. Refer to Note 11 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding this plan.\nThe proportion of the assets that will fund the deferred compensation payments within a year are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining assets are classified as non-current and are included in other long-term assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nContingent Consideration\nContingent consideration represents the earnout liability related to the Barletta acquisition and is valued using a probability-weighted scenario analysis of projected gross profit results and discounted at a risk-free rate. The contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. Actual gross profit results may differ significantly from those used in the estimate above, which may affect future payments. Changes in future payments will be reflected in future operating results as they occur.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the contingent consideration:\nAugust 26,\n2023 August 27,\nBeginning fair value - contingent consideration $ 39.8 $ -\nAdditions - 24.2\nFair value adjustments 0.6 29.4\nSettlements (22.0) (13.2)\nOther - (0.6)\nEnding fair value - contingent consideration $ 18.4 $ 39.8\nThe fair value of the earnout liability that will be settled within a year is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The remaining earnout liability is included in other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain financial instruments are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These assets primarily include goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, and right-of-use lease assets. These assets were originally recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined at date of acquisition or purchase. If certain triggering events occur, or if an annual impairment test is required, we will evaluate the non-financial asset for impairment. If an impairment has occurred, the asset will be written down to its current estimated fair value. No impairments were recorded for non-financial assets in Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nAssets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value\nCertain financial instruments are not measured at fair value but are recorded at carrying amounts approximating fair value based on their short-term nature. These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, and other payables. If these instruments were measured at fair value in the financial statements, they would be classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nLong-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. The fair value of our long-term debt was determined using current quoted prices in active markets for our publicly traded debt obligations, which is classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. See Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information about the fair value of our long-term debt.\nNote 5. Inventories\nInventories consist of the following:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nFinished goods $ 53.0 $ 59.3\nWork-in-process (\"WIP\") 159.9 198.9\nRaw materials 305.6 315.0\nTotal 518.5 573.2\nLess: Excess of FIFO over LIFO cost 47.9 47.4\nInventories, net $ 470.6 $ 525.8\nInventory valuation methods consist of the following:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nLIFO basis $ 262.6 $ 212.3\nFIFO basis 255.9 360.9\nTotal $ 518.5 $ 573.2\nThe above value of inventories, before reduction for the LIFO reserve, approximates replacement cost at the respective dates.\nNote 6. Property, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and consists of the following:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nLand $ 14.6 $ 14.6\nBuildings and building improvements 247.3 171.0\nMachinery and equipment 159.3 142.6\nSoftware 52.7 43.8\nTransportation 7.2 6.5\nConstruction in progress 49.3 76.8\nProperty, plant, and equipment, gross 530.4 455.3\nLess: Accumulated depreciation 203.1 179.1\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net $ 327.3 $ 276.2\nDepreciation expense was $29.2 million, $24.2 million, and $18.2 million for Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nNote 7. Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment, with no accumulated impairment losses, for Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 are as follows:\n(in millions) Towable\nRV Motorhome\nRV Marine Corporate / All Other Total\nBalances at August 28, 2021 $ 244.7 $ 73.1 $ 30.3 $ - $ 348.1\nAcquisition of Barletta(1)\n- - 136.1 - 136.1\nBalances at August 27, 2022 $ 244.7 $ 73.1 $ 166.4 - $ 484.2\nAcquisition of Lithionics(2)\n- - - 30.3 30.3\nBalances at August 26, 2023 $ 244.7 $ 73.1 $ 166.4 $ 30.3 $ 514.5\n(1) The change in marine activity is related to the acquisition of Barletta that occurred on August 31, 2021. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(2) The change in Corporate / All Other activity is related to the acquisition of Lithionics that occurred on April 28, 2023. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe valuation used to test goodwill for impairment is dependent upon a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and our business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our goodwill impairment analysis, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.\nOther intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, consist of the following:\nAugust 26, 2023\n(in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value\nIndefinite-lived trade names $ 352.3 $ - $ 352.3\nFinite-lived trade name 4.1 0.2 3.9\nDealer networks/customer relationships 183.6 75.6 108.0\nBacklog 43.6 42.5 1.1\nDeveloped technology 38.3 1.8 36.5\nNon-compete agreements 6.6 6.4 0.2\nOther intangible assets $ 628.5 $ 126.5 $ 502.0\nAugust 27, 2022\n(in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Value\nIndefinite-lived trade names $ 352.3 $ - $ 352.3\nDealer networks/customer relationships 180.0 60.5 119.5\nBacklog 42.3 42.3 -\nNon-compete agreements 6.6 6.0 0.6\nOther intangible assets $ 581.2 $ 108.8 $ 472.4\nThe weighted average remaining amortization period for finite-lived intangible assets as of August 26, 2023 was approximately seven years.\nEstimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets is as follows:\n(in millions) Amortization\nFiscal 2024 $ 22.5\nFiscal 2025 22.1\nFiscal 2026 21.7\nFiscal 2027 21.7\nFiscal 2028 21.4\nThereafter 40.3\nTotal amortization expense remaining $ 149.7\nNote 8. Product Warranties\nWe provide certain service and warranty on our products. From time to time, we also voluntarily incur costs for certain warranty-type expenses occurring after the normal warranty period expires to help protect the reputation of our products and maintain the goodwill of our customers. Estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and are based upon historical warranty and service claims experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and cost experience becomes available.\nIn addition to the costs associated with the contractual warranty coverage provided on products, we also occasionally incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions. Although we estimate and reserve for the cost of these service actions when probable and estimable, there can be no assurance that expense levels will remain at current levels or such reserves will continue to be adequate.\nChanges in the product warranty liability are as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of year $ 127.9 $ 91.2 $ 64.0\nBusiness acquisitions(1)\n1.4 4.7 -\nProvision 67.1 119.2 90.0\nClaims paid (98.6) (87.2) (62.8)\nBalance at end of year $ 97.8 $ 127.9 $ 91.2\n(1) Refer to Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on the acquisition of Lithionics on April 28, 2023 and the acquisition of Barletta on August 31, 2021.\nNote 9. Long-Term Debt\nOn July 15, 2022, we amended and restated our asset-backed revolving credit agreement (\"ABL Credit Facility\") to, among other things, increase the commitments available from $192.5 million to $350.0 million, and extend the maturity date from October 22, 2024 to July 15, 2027 (subject to certain factors which may accelerate the maturity date). The $350.0 million credit facility is on a revolving basis, subject to availability under a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory. The ABL Credit Facility is available for issuance of letters of credit to a specified limit of $35.0 million. We pay a commitment fee of 0.25% based on the average daily amount of the facility available, but unused during the most recent quarter. We can elect to base the interest rate on various rates plus specific spreads depending on the borrowing amount outstanding. If drawn, interest on the ABL Credit Facility borrowings is at a floating rate based upon our election, either term SOFR or REVSOFR30 (as defined in the credit agreement), plus, in each case, a credit spread adjustment of 0.10%, as well as an applicable spread between 1.25% and 1.75%, depending on the usage of the facility during the most recent quarter. Based on current usage, we would pay an applicable spread of 1.25%. In connection with the amendment, we capitalized $1.2 million of issuance costs that are being amortized over the five-year term of the agreement.\nOn July 8, 2020, we closed our private offering (the Senior Secured Notes Offering) of $300.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2028 (the Senior Secured Notes). The Senior Secured Notes were issued in accordance with an Indenture dated as of July 8, 2020 (the Indenture). The Senior Secured Notes will mature on July 15, 2028 unless earlier redeemed or repurchased. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes accrues starting July 8, 2020 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, which began on January 15, 2021. The Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees are secured by (i) a first-priority lien on substantially all of our existing and future assets (other than certain collateral under the ABL Credit Facility) and (ii) a second-priority lien on our present and future receivables, inventory and other related assets and proceeds that secure the ABL Credit Facility on a first-priority basis.\nThe Indenture limits certain of our abilities (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications) to incur additional debt and provide additional guarantees; make restricted payments; create or permit certain liens; make certain asset sales; use the proceeds from the sale of assets and subsidiary stock; create or permit restrictions on the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other inter-company distributions; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; designate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our restricted subsidiaries.\nDebt issuance costs incurred and capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the associated debt agreement. If early principal payments are made on the Senior Secured Notes, a proportional amount of the unamortized debt issuance costs is expensed. As part of the Senior Secured Notes Offering, we capitalized $7.5 million in debt issuance costs that are being amortized over the eight-year term of the agreement.\nConvertible Notes\nOn November 1, 2019, we issued $300.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.5% unsecured Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (Convertible Notes). The net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes, after deducting the initial purchasers' transaction fees and offering expense payable by us, were approximately $290.2 million. The Convertible Notes bear interest at the annual rate of 1.5%, payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020, and will mature on April 1, 2025, unless earlier converted or repurchased by us.\nThe Convertible Notes will be convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election, at an initial conversion rate of 15.6906 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $63.73 per share, as adjusted pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes may be converted at any time on or after October 1, 2024, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date.\nThe conversion rate of the Convertible Notes may be adjusted in certain circumstances, including in connection with a conversion of the Convertible Notes made following certain fundamental changes and under other circumstances set forth in the indenture. As of August 26, 2023, the conversion rate was 15.9395 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $62.74. The difference between the initial conversion rate and the\nconversion rate as of August 26, 2023 is due to cash dividends that have been declared following the issuance of the Convertible Notes.\nIt is our current intent to settle all conversions of the Convertible Notes in cash. Our ability to cash settle may be limited depending on the stock price at the time of conversion.\nPrior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding October 1, 2024, the Convertible Notes will be convertible only under the following circumstances:\n1.during any calendar quarter commencing after December 31, 2019 if the closing sale price of the common stock is more than 130% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;\n2.during the 5 consecutive business day period after any 5 consecutive trading day period (the \"measurement period\") in which the trading price per $1 thousand principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes on each such trading day; or\n3.upon the occurrence of certain specified corporate events set forth in the Convertible Notes Indenture.\nWe may not redeem the Convertible Notes at our option prior to the maturity date, and no sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes.\nOn October 29, 2019 and October 30, 2019, in connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated Convertible Note hedge transactions (collectively, the Hedge Transactions) that cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes, and are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount due, as the case may be, upon conversion of the Convertible Notes in the event that the market price of our common stock is greater than the strike price of the Hedge Transactions, which was initially $63.73 per share (subject to adjustment under the terms of the Hedge Transactions), corresponding to the initial conversion price of the Convertible Notes.\nOn October 29, 2019 and October 30, 2019, we also entered into privately negotiated warrant transactions (collectively, the Warrant Transactions and, together with the Hedge Transactions, the Call Spread Transactions), whereby we sold warrants at a higher strike price relating to the same number of shares of our common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The initial strike price of the warrants is $96.20 per share (subject to adjustment under the terms of the Warrant Transactions), which is 100% above the last reported sale price of our common stock on October 29, 2019. The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect to our shareholders to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrant Transactions, exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\nWe used $28.6 million of the net proceeds from the issuance of the Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the Call Spread Transactions.\nThe Hedge Transactions and the Warrant Transactions are separate transactions, in each case, and are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes and will not affect any holders rights under the Convertible Notes. Holders of the Convertible Notes will not have any rights with respect to the Call Spread Transactions.\nAccounting Treatment of the Convertible Notes and Related Hedge Transactions and Warrant Transactions\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective approach. The new guidance simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models. As a result, more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost.\nPrior to our adoption of ASU 2020-06, we bifurcated the proceeds from the offering of the Convertible Notes between liability and equity components. On the date of issuance, the liability and equity components were calculated to be approximately $215.0 million and $85.0 million, respectively. The initial $215.0 million liability component was determined based on the fair value of similar debt instruments excluding the conversion feature assuming a hypothetical interest rate of 8%. The initial $85.0 million ($64.1 million net of tax) equity component represented the difference between the fair value of the initial $215.0 million in debt and the $300.0 million of gross proceeds. The initial debt discount of $85.0 million was being amortized over the life of the Convertible Notes as non-cash interest expense using the effective interest method. We recognized $15.1 million and $13.9 million of non-cash interest expense during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. In addition, offering-related costs of $9.8 million were allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds.\nIn connection with our adoption of ASU 2020-06, we derecognized the remaining unamortized interest discount on the Convertible Notes and therefore recorded no non-cash interest expense related to the amortization of the debt discount in Fiscal 2023. As a result, the Convertible Notes are now accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized cost. Interest expense, representing\nthe amortization of the debt issuance costs as well as the contractual interest expense is amortized using an effective interest rate of 2.1% over the term of the Convertible Notes. We recorded interest expense of $6.3 million, $19.6 million, and $18.4 million for Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRefer to Note 16 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information related to the earnings per share impact associated with the Convertible Notes and our adoption of ASU-2020-06.\nThe net cost incurred in connection with the Call Spread Transactions was $11.2 million. These transactions are classified as equity and are not remeasured each reporting period.\nLong-term debt consists of the following:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nABL Credit Facility $ - $ -\nSenior Secured Notes 300.0 300.0\nConvertible Notes 300.0 300.0\nLong-term debt, gross 600.0 600.0\nConvertible Notes unamortized interest discount - (45.3)\nDebt issuance cost, net (7.6) (8.8)\nLong-term debt, net $ 592.4 $ 545.9\nFair Value and Future Maturities\nAs of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, the fair value of long-term debt, gross, was $640.2 million and $634.2 million, respectively. The fair value of the Convertible Notes was $349.0 million as of August 26, 2023. We are in compliance with all of our financial debt covenants as of August 26, 2023.\nAggregate contractual maturities of debt in future fiscal years are as follows:\n(in millions) Amount\nFiscal 2024 $ -\nFiscal 2025 300.0\nFiscal 2026 -\nFiscal 2027 -\nFiscal 2028 300.0\nThereafter -\nTotal Long-term debt, gross $ 600.0\nNote 10. Leases\nOur leases primarily include operating leases for equipment and real estate, including office space and manufacturing space. Financing leases are primarily for real estate and solar energy producing equipment. For any lease with an initial term in excess of 12 months, the related lease assets and liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either operating or finance leases at the inception of an agreement when it is determined that a lease exists. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components, and have elected to combine lease and non-lease components for all classes of assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. When the terms of multiple lease agreements are materially consistent, we have elected the portfolio approach for our asset and liability calculations.\nLease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at commencement date. We generally use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of future payments. The assumed lease terms generally do not include options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nSome of our real estate operating leases require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance, and insurance. In addition, some of the leases are subject to annual changes in the consumer price index. These components comprise the majority of our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of the lease obligations. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. For operating leases, we recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the commencement date to the end of the lease term.\nThe supplemental balance sheet information related to our leases is as follows:\n(in millions) Classification August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nAssets\nOperating leases Operating lease assets $ 42.6 $ 41.1\nFinance leases Other long-term assets 8.1 6.7\nTotal lease assets $ 50.7 $ 47.8\nLiabilities\nCurrent: Operating leases Other current liabilities $ 5.9 $ 4.7\nCurrent: Finance leases Other current liabilities 1.3 1.0\nNon-Current: Operating leases Long-term operating lease liabilities 42.0 40.4\nNon-Current: Finance leases Other long-term liabilities 7.7 6.7\nTotal lease liabilities $ 56.9 $ 52.8\nOperating lease costs incurred are as follows:\n(in millions) Classification 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease expense(1)\nCosts of goods sold and SG&A $ 10.3 $ 9.6 $ 5.8\nFinance lease cost:\nDepreciation of lease assets Costs of goods sold and SG&A 1.0 0.8 0.6\nInterest on lease liabilities Interest expense, net 0.5 0.4 0.3\nTotal lease cost $ 11.8 $ 10.8 $ 6.7\n(1) Operating lease expense includes short-term leases and variable lease payments, which are immaterial.\nOur future lease commitments as of August 26, 2023 included the following related party and non-related party leases:\nOperating Leases Financing Leases\n(in millions) Related Party Amount Non-Related Party Amount Total Non-Related Party Amount\nFiscal 2024 $ 1.8 $ 6.5 $ 8.3 $ 1.8\nFiscal 2025 1.8 6.6 8.4 1.9\nFiscal 2026 1.8 6.3 8.1 1.9\nFiscal 2027 1.8 6.1 7.9 1.9\nFiscal 2028 1.8 6.0 7.8 2.1\nThereafter 2.4 17.0 19.4 1.2\nTotal future undiscounted lease payments 11.4 48.5 59.9 10.8\nLess: Interest 2.0 10.0 12.0 1.8\nTotal reported lease liabilities $ 9.4 $ 38.5 $ 47.9 $ 9.0\nAdditional information related to our leases is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 5.0 $ 3.7 $ 2.6\nOperating cash flows from financing leases 0.5 0.4 0.3\nFinancing cash flows from financing leases 1.1 0.9 0.6\nWeighted average remaining lease term:\nOperating leases 7.3 8.1 8.1\nFinance leases 5.2 6.0 6.8\nWeighted average discount rate:\nOperating leases 6.2 % 5.8 % 6.2 %\nFinance leases 6.4 % 5.9 % 6.3 %\nNote 11. Employee and Retiree Benefits\nDeferred compensation benefits are as follows:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nNon-qualified deferred compensation $ 6.7 $ 7.9\nSupplemental executive retirement plan 1.2 1.4\nExecutive deferred compensation plan 1.8 1.4\nTotal deferred compensation benefits 9.7 10.7\nLess current portion(1)\n1.8 2.6\nDeferred compensation benefits, net of current portion $ 7.9 $ 8.1\n(1) Included in accrued compensation on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDeferred Compensation Benefits\nNon-Qualified Deferred Compensation\nWe have a non-qualified deferred compensation program which permitted key employees to annually elect to defer a portion of their compensation until their retirement. The plan has been closed to any additional deferrals since January 2001. The retirement benefit to be provided is based upon the amount of compensation deferred and the age of the individual at the time of the contracted deferral. An individual generally vests at age 55 and 5 years of participation under the plan. For deferrals prior to December 1992, vesting occurs at the later of age 55 and 5 years of service from first deferral or 20 years of service. Deferred compensation expense was $0.5 million, $0.6 million, and $0.8 million in Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (\"SERP\")\nThe primary purpose of this plan was to provide our officers and managers with supplemental retirement income for a period of 15 years after retirement. We have not offered this plan on a continuing basis to members of management since 1998. The plan was funded with individual whole life insurance policies (split dollar program) owned by the named insured officer or manager. We initially paid the life insurance premiums on the life of the individual, and the individual would receive life insurance and supplemental cash payments during the 15 years following retirement. In October 2008, the plan was amended as a result of changes in the tax and accounting regulations and rising administrative costs. Under the redesigned SERP, the underlying life insurance policies previously owned by the insured individual became company-owned life insurance (\"COLI\") by a release of all interests by the participant and assignment to Winnebago Industries as a prerequisite to participate in the SERP and transition from the Split Dollar Program. This program remains closed to new employee participation.\nTo assist in funding the deferred compensation and SERP liabilities, we have invested in COLI policies. The cash surrender value of these policies is presented in investment in life insurance in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and consists of the following:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nCash value $ 68.1 $ 67.2\nBorrowings (38.8) (38.6)\nInvestment in life insurance $ 29.3 $ 28.6\nExecutive Deferred Compensation Plan\nIn December 2006, we adopted the Winnebago Industries, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the \"Executive Deferred Compensation Plan\"). Under the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, corporate officers and certain key employees may annually choose to defer up to 50% of their salary and up to 100% of their cash incentive awards. The assets are presented as other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Such assets on August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022 were $1.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively.\nProfit Sharing Plan\nWe have a qualified profit sharing and contributory 401(k) plan for eligible employees. The plan provides matching contributions made by Winnebago Industries and discretionary contributions as approved by the Board of Directors. Matching contributions to the plan for Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 were $13.4 million, $12.0 million, and $5.6 million, respectively. No discretionary contributions were approved in Fiscal 2023. Discretionary contributions of $12.1 million and $6.1 million were approved in Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nNote 12. Contingent Liabilities and Commitments\nRepurchase Commitments\nGenerally, manufacturers in the same industries as us enter into repurchase agreements with lending institutions which have provided wholesale floorplan financing to dealers. Most dealers are financed on a \"floorplan\" basis under which a bank or finance company lends the dealer all, or substantially all, of the purchase price, collateralized by a security interest in the units purchased.\nOur repurchase agreements generally provide that, in the event of default by the dealer on the agreement to pay the lending institution, we will repurchase the financed merchandise. The terms of these agreements, which generally can last up to 24 months, provide that our liability will be the lesser of remaining principal owed by the dealer to the lending institution, or dealer invoice less periodic reductions based on the time since the date of the original invoice. Our liability cannot exceed 100% of the dealer invoice. In certain instances, we also repurchase inventory from dealers due to state law or regulatory requirements that govern voluntary or involuntary relationship terminations. Although laws vary from state to state, some states have laws in place that require manufacturers of recreational vehicles or boats to repurchase current inventory if a dealership exits the business. The total contingent liability on all repurchase agreements was approximately $1,816.7 million and $1,783.7 million as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively.\nOur loss reserve for repurchase commitments contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding a number of factors. Our risk of loss related to these repurchase commitments is significantly reduced by the potential resale value of any products that are subject to repurchase and is spread over numerous dealers and lenders. The aggregate contingent liability related to our repurchase agreements represents all financed dealer inventory at the period-end reporting date subject to a repurchase agreement, net of the greater of periodic reductions per the agreement or dealer principal payments. Based on these repurchase agreements and our historical loss experience, an associated loss reserve is established which is included in other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our repurchase accrual was $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively. Repurchase risk is affected by the credit worthiness of our dealer network. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to establish the loss reserve for repurchase commitments.\nThere was no material activity related to repurchase agreements during Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings which are considered ordinary and routine litigation incidental to the business, some of which are covered in whole or in part by insurance. While we believe the ultimate disposition of litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, the possibility exists that such litigation may have an impact on our results for a particular reporting period in which litigation effects become probable and reasonably estimable. Though we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change related to these matters, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future.\nNote 13. Revenue Recognition\nAll operating revenue is generated from contracts with customers. Our primary revenue source is generated through the sale of manufactured towable RV units, motorhome RV units and marine units to our independent dealer network (our customers). The following table disaggregates revenue by reportable segment and product category:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nNet Revenues\nTowable RV:\nFifth Wheel $ 715.1 $ 1,260.9 $ 1,024.4\nTravel Trailer 658.2 1,296.6 959.7\nOther(1)\n42.0 39.9 25.9\nTotal Towable RV 1,415.3 2,597.4 2,010.0\nMotorhome RV:\nClass A 736.0 786.8 690.2\nClass B 424.8 718.0 532.2\nClass C and Other(1)\n399.3 406.4 316.7\nTotal Motorhome RV 1,560.1 1,911.2 1,539.1\nMarine 469.7 425.3 60.2\nCorporate / All Other(2)\n45.6 23.8 20.5\nConsolidated $ 3,490.7 $ 4,957.7 $ 3,629.8\n(1) Relates to parts, accessories, and services.\n(2) Relates to units, parts, accessories, and services associated with Winnebago specialty vehicles. In addition, this activity also includes Lithionics battery sales, including the related systems and accessories, that are sold directly to external customers.\nWe do not have material contract assets or liabilities.\nConcentration of Risk\nNo single dealer organization accounted for more than 10% of net revenues for Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nNote 14. Stock-Based Compensation Plans\nOn December 11, 2018, our shareholders approved the Winnebago Industries, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\"2019 Plan\") as detailed in our Proxy Statement for the 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The 2019 Plan allows us to grant or issue non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted share units, and other equity compensation to key employees and to non-employee directors. The 2019 Plan replaces the 2014 Omnibus Equity, Performance Award, and Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended, the \"2014 Plan\"). The number of shares of our common stock that may be awarded and issued under the 2019 Plan is 4.1 million shares, plus the shares subject to any awards outstanding under the 2014 Plan and our predecessor plan, the 2004 Incentive Compensation Plan (the 2004 Plan), on December 11, 2018 that subsequently expire, are forfeited or canceled, or are settled for cash. Until such time, awards under the 2014 Plan and the 2004 Plan, respectively, that were outstanding on December 11, 2018 will continue to be subject to the terms of the 2014 Plan or 2004 Plan, as applicable. Shares remaining available for future awards under the 2014 Plan were not carried over into the 2019 Plan.\nOur outstanding options have a 10-year term. Options issued to employees generally vest over a three-year period in equal annual installments on the annual anniversary dates following the grant date. Share awards generally vest based either upon continued employment (\"time-based\") or upon attainment of specified goals. Outstanding share awards that are not time-based vest at the end of a three-year incentive period based upon the achievement of company performance goals (\"performance-based\"). Generally, time-based share awards vest in the same manner as options, except for time-based share awards to directors, which vest one year from the grant date.\nBeginning with our annual grant of restricted stock units in October 2018, dividend equivalents are attached to restricted stock units equal to dividends payable on the same number of shares of our common stock during the applicable period. Dividend equivalents, settled in cash, accrue on restricted stock unit awards during the vesting period. No dividend equivalents are paid on any restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date.\nOur Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") permits employees to purchase Winnebago Industries, Inc. common stock at a 15% discount from the market price at the end of semi-annual purchase periods and is compensatory. In Fiscal 2023 and 2022, approximately 29,000 shares and 42,000 shares, respectively, were purchased through the ESPP. Plan participants had accumulated $0.5 million and $0.4 million as of August 26, 2023 and August 27, 2022, respectively, to purchase our common stock\npursuant to this plan. As of August 26, 2023, 250,000 shares were authorized for issuance and approximately 34,000 shares remain available for future issuance.\nCompensation expense associated with share-based awards is recognized over the requisite service or performance period of the award, unless accelerated by certain retirement eligibility provisions. Forfeitures are recorded when they occur. Total stock-based compensation expense for the past three fiscal years consisted of the following components:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nShare awards:\nTime-based $ 9.8 $ 7.6 $ 5.7\nPerformance-based (0.9) 7.4 7.9\nStock options 1.3 1.0 1.0\nOther(1)\n0.7 1.1 0.7\nTotal stock-based compensation expense $ 10.9 $ 17.1 $ 15.3\n(1) Includes stock-based compensation expense related to Board of Directors stock award expense and ESPP expense. Directors may elect to defer all or part of their annual retainer into a deferred compensation plan. The plan allows them to defer into either money units or stock units.\nRestricted Stock Units - Time-Based\nThe fair value of time-based restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of nonvested time-based restricted stock units at August 26, 2023, and changes during Fiscal 2023, is as follows:\nShares(1)\nWeighted Average Fair Value\nOutstanding at August 27, 2022 328,838 $ 55.85\nGranted 221,777 $ 56.13\nVested (153,806) $ 53.49\nForfeited/canceled (14,048) $ 59.88\nOutstanding at August 26, 2023 382,761 $ 56.81\n(1) Number of shares in the above table are shown in whole numbers.\nAs of August 26, 2023, there was $10.1 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested time-based restricted stock units that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during Fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $8.8 million, $8.0 million, and $5.2 million, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units - Performance-Based\nThe fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of our stock on the date of grant. A summary of the status of our nonvested performance-based restricted stock units at August 26, 2023, and changes during Fiscal 2023, is as follows:\nShares(1)\nWeighted Average Fair Value\nOutstanding at August 27, 2022 198,206 $ 58.45\nGranted 149,962 $ 53.11\nVested (135,520) $ 49.18\nForfeited/canceled - $ -\nOutstanding at August 26, 2023 212,648 $ 60.59\n(1) Number of shares in the above table are shown in whole numbers.\nAs of August 26, 2023, there was $4.9 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance-based restricted stock units that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1 year. The total fair value of performance-based restricted stock units vested during Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022, and Fiscal 2021 was $7.6 million, $5.8 million, and $1.4 million, respectively.\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity for Fiscal 2023 is as follows:\nStock Options(1)\nWeighted Average Exercise Price Per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Term (in years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value\nOutstanding at August 27, 2022 322,107 $ 44.75\nGranted 66,873 $ 56.09\nExercised - $ -\nForfeited/canceled - $ -\nOutstanding at August 26, 2023 388,980 $ 46.70 6.2 $ 7,077\nExercisable at August 26, 2023 278,339 $ 41.17 5.2 $ 6,417\n(1) Number of shares in the above table are shown in whole numbers.\nAs of August 26, 2023, there was $1.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 0.9 years.\nThe fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nValuation Assumptions(1)\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected dividend yield 1.9 % 1.0 % 0.8 %\nRisk-free interest rate(2)\n4.1 % 1.1 % 0.3 %\nExpected life of stock options (in years)(3)\n5 5 5\nExpected stock price volatility(4)\n50.8 % 48.5 % 48.6 %\nWeighted average fair value of options granted $ 23.94 $ 30.47 $ 21.65\n(1) Forfeitures are recorded when they occur.\n(2) Based on U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options.\n(3) Estimated based on historical experience.\n(4) Based on historical experience over a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options.\nNote 15. Income Taxes\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nCurrent\nFederal $ 38.2 $ 105.9 $ 71.6\nState 8.8 24.9 16.2\nTotal 47.0 130.8 87.8\nDeferred\nFederal 15.9 (5.6) 0.7\nState 0.4 (1.1) (2.9)\nTotal 16.3 (6.7) (2.2)\nProvision for income taxes $ 63.3 $ 124.1 $ 85.6\nAs of August 26, 2023, $10.7 million of U.S. federal income taxes receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Comparatively, as of August 27, 2022, $0.7 million of U.S. federal income taxes payable was included in income taxes payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate is as follows:\n2023 2022 2021\nU.S. federal statutory rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes, net of federal benefit 3.1 % 3.5 % 3.3 %\nIncome tax credits (1.1) % (0.5) % (0.6) %\nNondeductible compensation 1.1 % 0.9 % 0.5 %\nTax-free and dividend income (0.1) % (0.1) % (0.1) %\nUncertain tax position settlements and adjustments 0.1 % (0.1) % (0.1) %\nOther items (1.4) % (0.6) % (0.7) %\nEffective tax provision rate 22.7 % 24.1 % 23.3 %\nOur effective tax rate decreased to 22.7% in Fiscal 2023 compared to 24.1% in Fiscal 2022 primarily due to both an increase in tax credits year-over-year over decreased income in the current year and favorable return to provision adjustments.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law in the U.S. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax rate applied to certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The amount of excise tax on Fiscal 2023 stock repurchases was not significant to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred income taxes were as follows:\n(in millions) August 26, 2023 August 27, 2022\nWarranty reserves $ 23.5 $ 30.7\nDeferred compensation 2.4 3.0\nSelf-insurance reserve 5.1 4.9\nStock-based compensation 4.2 5.5\nLeases 13.8 12.9\nConvertible notes 5.8 -\nCapitalized research and development costs 11.1 -\nOther 13.9 9.1\nTotal deferred tax assets 79.8 66.1\nConvertible notes - 2.0\nIntangibles 50.5 39.5\nDepreciation 28.7 19.0\nLeases 12.3 11.7\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 91.5 72.2\nTotal deferred income tax liabilities, net $ 11.7 $ 6.1\nChanges in the unrecognized tax benefits are as follows:\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021\nBalance at beginning of year $ 5.0 $ 5.5 $ 5.8\nGross decreases-tax positions in a prior year (1.5) (1.1) (0.9)\nGross increases-tax positions in a prior year 1.0 - -\nGross increases-current year tax positions 1.0 0.6 0.6\nBalance at end of year 5.5 5.0 5.5\nAccrued interest and penalties 0.6 0.7 1.0\nTotal unrecognized tax benefits $ 6.1 $ 5.7 $ 6.5\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits is not expected to change materially within the next 12 months. If the remaining uncertain tax positions are ultimately resolved favorably, $5.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits would have a favorable impact on our effective tax rate. It is our policy to recognize interest and penalties accrued relative to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\nWe file a U.S. Federal tax return, as well as returns in various international and state jurisdictions. Although certain years are no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") and various state taxing authorities, net operating loss carryforwards generated in those years may still be adjusted upon examination by the IRS or state taxing authorities. As of August 26, 2023, our federal returns from Fiscal 2020 to present are subject to review by the IRS. With limited exception, state returns from Fiscal 2019 to present continue to be subject to review by state taxing jurisdictions. We are currently under review by certain U.S. state tax authorities for Fiscal 2019 through Fiscal 2021. Several years may lapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved and it is difficult to predict the outcome of such audits. We believe we have adequately reserved for our exposure to potential additional payments for uncertain tax positions in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nNote 16. Earnings per Share\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2023, we adopted ASU 2020-06. Prior to adoption, we utilized the treasury stock method for calculating the dilutive impact of our Convertible Notes. Upon adoption, we prospectively utilized the if-converted method to calculate the dilutive impact of our Convertible Notes. Under the if-converted method, the Convertible Notes are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the reporting period, and the resulting shares are included in the denominator of the calculation. In addition, interest charges, net of any income tax effects are added back to the numerator of the calculation.\nBasic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows:\n(in millions, except per share data) 2023 2022 2021\nEarnings per share - basic\nNet income $ 215.9 $ 390.6 $ 281.9\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 30.3 32.5 33.5\nBasic earnings per common share(1)\n$ 7.12 $ 12.03 $ 8.41\nEarnings per share - diluted\nNet income $ 215.9 $ 390.6 $ 281.9\nInterest expense on convertible notes, net of tax 4.7 - -\nDiluted net income $ 220.6 $ 390.6 $ 281.9\nWeighted average common shares outstanding 30.3 32.5 33.5\nDilutive impact of stock compensation awards 0.3 0.5 0.4\nDilutive impact of convertible notes 4.8 - 0.2\nWeighted average common shares outstanding, assuming dilution 35.4 33.0 34.1\nAnti-dilutive securities excluded from weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 0.1 0.2 -\nDiluted earnings per common share(1)\n$ 6.23 $ 11.84 $ 8.28\n(1) Earnings per share amounts are calculated based on unrounded numbers and therefore may not recalculate using the rounded numbers provided.\nFor all periods presented, the dilutive effect of stock compensation awards was determined using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, shares associated with certain anti-dilutive securities have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation because the exercise of those options would lead to a net reduction in common shares outstanding or anti-dilution. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \"Evaluation Date\"). Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the Evaluation Date.\nEvaluation of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement's report on internal control over financial reporting as of August 26, 2023 is included within Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting is included within Item 8 of Part II in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no significant changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended August 26, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information.\nDuring the three months ended August 26, 2023, no director or officer of the Company adopted, modified or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nOn October 17, 2023, we entered into a second amended and restated employment agreement (the Employment Agreement) with Donald Clark, President of the Companys Grand Design RV operating segment (GDRV) and Senior Vice President of the Company. The Employment Agreement is effective as of September 1, 2023, following the expiration of Mr. Clarks prior employment agreement on August 31, 2023 (the First Amended Agreement).\nThe Employment Agreement generally contains terms and conditions that are consistent with the terms and conditions of the First Amended Agreement. The primary changes to the terms of the Employment Agreement include:\nEstablishing a new multi-year employment term lasting until August 31, 2028;\nProviding for an increase in Mr. Clarks annual base salary from $400,000 to $500,000; and\nProviding for an annual short-term incentive opportunity (Annual Incentive) equal to 3.5% of the pretax net income of GDRV, payable in cash as compared to a combination of stock and cash (which cash portion was also paid quarterly) under the First Amended Agreement; provided, however, that 90% of the aggregate Annual Incentive amount will be paid quarterly based on GDRVs pretax income for the applicable fiscal quarter and 10% of the aggregate Annual Incentive amount will be based on GDRVs performance for the applicable fiscal year against an operating target set by the Company and will be paid on an annual basis.\nWe also entered into a second amended and restated change in control agreement (Change in Control Agreement) with Mr. Clark effective as of September 1, 2023, that will replace his current change in control agreement with the Company dated as of September 1, 2019. The Change in Control Agreement is materially consistent with the form we adopted and implemented in December 2021 for use with all other executive officers, except that the definition of Cause under the Change in Control Agreement has been modified to be consistent with the definition of Cause under the Employment Agreement. Additionally, the Change in Control Agreement continues to limit any payment Mr. Clark may receive thereunder to a cap of $3,000,000.\nThe foregoing descriptions of the Employment Agreement and the Change in Control Agreement are only summaries and the full text of each agreement is filed as Exhibit 10.30 and Exhibit 10.31, respectively, to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 9C.
