    "content": "Item 1. Description of Business\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nIn General\nTofla Megaline was incorporated in the state of Nevada on August 31, 2018. Tofla Megaline has only one officer and director who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo. We are a development stage Company and operate in the business of software development for robotic devices. We plan to provide easy-to-use, high quality and cost-effective automation AI solutions. Tofla Megaline will be focusing on both stand-alone and integrated solutions in order to cover a broader selection of services, especially in the surveillance area. Using autonomous robotic units as a means of surveillance is a new tendency all over the globe. Robotic units can be used for patrolling warehouses, malls, backyards, office areas and buildings etc. Our focus is going to be developing specialized software for the units that will cover all the necessary functionality for surveillance and data transfer. We intend to engage in business activity, however, there is no assurance that we will be successful in developing our marketable product.\nWe intend to design and operate our systems as a solution to be integrated with already existing control equipment and security systems, or separately as standalone versions. We are also planning to extend the diversity of our products and develop software for service industry, like delivery services or health care. Our initial steps will be developing software which is easily integrated into existing security and video surveillance systems as well as custom solutions in addition to existing surveillance systems. We also consider developing software which can be programmed to move in a given direction for long distances, make time reminders, respond to voices, recognize and complete commands.\nSoftware Description\nRobotic units using Toflas intended software are going to be programmed to follow specific routes while recording current situation with built-in cameras and analyzing it. Inner systems will use infrared lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of the day and sensitive microphones for the most accurate recording of all sounds. Visual and audio data will be streamed to responsible personnel in real time and also recorded for storage at a remote server. The units will be able to detect security violations and send notifications or pursue trespassers in order to identify and gather their parameters which may then be used for law enforcement purposes. The units will be capable of giving warnings using light and audio.\nTofla software will enable robots to operate both indoors and outdoors on different surfaces. Such robots may be easily stored at any location when not needed. However, their main focus will be patrolling shopping centers, supermarkets, parking lots, large Company offices, educational institutions, warehouses, private property and other locations. Depending on customers requirements we are planning to install additional functions and tune the standard ones.\nPotential clients\nWe plan to offer our product to owners of big spaces such as parking lots, shopping malls, factories, corporate facilities, warehouses, restricted areas, private areas, airports, stations, educational and state institutions.\nMarketing\nWe believe that the key marketing strategy for our type of business is online marketing. We plan to advertise our Company on the Internet via Google AdWords and Yahoo Ad Manager technologies using several online marketing strategies to attract users to our promotional website. It is going to contain information about the software we will develop, its applicable features, advantages and contact information. Tofla Megaline is also going to create and maintain profiles in social networking websites like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.\nWe intend to maintain an extensive marketing campaign that will ensure maximum visibility for the business in its target market. We plan to sell our software through direct emails, phone calls, business meetings and corporate presentations as well. Our sole officer and director, Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, will be responsible for marketing of our product. Even if we are able to obtain sufficient number of customers to buy our software, there is no guarantee that it will cover our costs and that we will be able to retain enough customers to justify our expenditures. If we are unable to generate a significant amount of revenue it would materially affect our financial condition and our business could be harmed. We will rely heavily on our clients recommending our technology to others in our target market.\nCompetition\nSoftware development market is rapidly growing day by day and there is a big number of companies operating in this domain. Our key feature is developing software for security purposes, ranging from surveillance and transferring visual data to a remote server to pursuing potential trespassers. Entry level barriers of the industry are relatively low and accessible which leads to an extremely high level of competition. We believe there are not too many developers of security software in Mexico and there is a niche to be occupied. We intend to focus and attend to individual needs of each of our potential clients.\nInsurance\nWe do not maintain any insurance and do not intend to maintain insurance in the future. Because we do not have any insurance, if we are made a party of a products liability action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation. If that occurs a judgment could be rendered against us that could cause us to cease operations.\nEmployees; Identification of Certain Significant Employees.\nWe are a development stage Company and currently have 1 (one) employee who is Rodolfo Guerrero Angulo, our sole officer and director. We may hire employees on an as needed basis following the process of implementing our business plan.\nOffices\nOur business office is located at Manzanillo 33. Local E, Mexico, Col. Roma Nort, Mexico, 06700. This office space is provided by our President for the company's needs at no cost. There is no formal rent agreement. Our telephone number is +525541607366.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe will be required to comply with all regulations, rules, and directives of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to our business in any jurisdiction which we would conduct activities. We do not believe that regulation will have a material impact on the way we conduct our business. Item 1A. Risk Factors\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 2. Properties.\nWe do not own any real estate or other properties. Item 3.

Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\nMARKET INFORMATION\nThere is currently no public trading market for our common stock and no such market may ever develop.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID:6258)\nBalance Sheets as of July 31, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Operations for the year ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders Equity (Deficit) as of July 31, 2022 and 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the year ended July 31, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to the Audited Financial Statements July 31, 2022\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Shareholders\nTofla Megaline\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Tofla Megaline as of July 31, 2022 and 2021 and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the year then ended and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tofla Megaline as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended July 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the entity will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the entity has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the entitys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to Tofla Megaline in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Tofla Megaline is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Mac Accounting Group, LLP\nWe have served as Tofla Megaline's auditor since 2021.\nMidvale, Utah\nOctober 31, 2022\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nBALANCE SHEETS\nJuly 31, 2022\nJuly 31, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash $ $ 4,100\nPrepaid Expense\n2,920\n3,451\nTotal Current Assets\n3,356\n7,551\nIntangible Assets, Net\n14,128\n-\nTOTAL ASSETS $ 17,484 $ 7,551\nLIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nLiabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nDirector's Loan $ 42,544 $ 6,130\nTotal Current Liabilities\n42,544\n6,130\nTotal Liabilities\n42,544\n6,130\nStockholders Equity (Deficit)\nCommon Stock, $0.001 par value, 75,000,000 shares authorized,\n4,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of July 31, 2022 and July 31, 2021\n4,500\n4,500\nAccumulated Deficit\n(29,560)\n(3,079)\nTotal Stockholders Equity (Deficit)\n(25,060)\n1,421\nTOTAL LIABILITIES & STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT) $ 17,484 $ 7,551\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nSTATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended July 31, 2022\nYear\nEnded July 31, 2021\nRevenues $ 4,050 $ -\nOperating Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses\n22,494\n1,073\nAmortization Expense\n2,197\n-\nServer rental\n5,840\n-\nTotal Operating Expenses\n(30,531)\n1,073\nNet loss from operations\n(26,481)\n(1,073)\nProvision for income taxes\n-\n-\nNet loss\n$ (26,481) $ (1,073)\nLoss per common share - Basic & Diluted $ (0.00) $ (0.00)\nWeighted Average Number of Common Shares Outstanding-Basic & Diluted\n4,500,000\n887,671\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nSTATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nCommon Stock\nAdditional Paid-in-Capital\nAccumulated\nDeficit\nTotal\nShares\nAmount\nBalance as of July 31, 2020 - $ - $ - $ (2,006) $ (2,006)\nCommon shares issued for cash at $0.001 4,500,000 $ 4,500 $ -\n-\n4,500\nNet loss for the period -\n-\n-\n(1,073)\n(1,073)\nBalance as of July 31, 2021 4,500,000\n4,500\n-\n(3,079)\n1,421\nNet loss for the period -\n-\n-\n(26,481)\n(26,481)\nBalance as of July 31, 2022 4,500,000 $ 4,500 $ - $ (29,560) $ (25,060)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYear Ended July 31, 2022\nYear Ended July 31, 2021\nOPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet Income $ (26,481) $ (1,073)\nAdjustments to reconcile Net Income\nto net cash provided by operations:\nAccumulated Amortization\n2,197\n-\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nPrepaid Expense\n(3,451)\nCash Flows used in Operating Activities\n(23,753)\n(4,524)\nINVESTING ACTIVITIES\nPurchase of intangible assets\n(16,325)\n-\nCash Flows (used in) provided by Investing Activities\n(16,325)\n-\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nProceeds from the sale of common stock\n-\n4,500\nProceeds from related party loan\n36,414\n4,124\nCash Flows provided by Financing Activities\n36,414\n8,624\nNet increase (decrease) in cash\n(3,664)\n4,100\nCash at beginning of period\n4,100\n-\nCash at end of period $ $ 4,100\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nCash payments For:\nInterest $ - $ -\nIncome taxes $ - $ -\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these audited financial statements.\nTOFLA MEGALINE\nNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nTOFLA MEGALINE (the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on August 31, 2018 (Inception). We are development stage Company and intend to commence operations in the business of developing the software for security systems in Mexico.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN\nThe financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future.\nThe Company incurred a net loss of $26,481 and $1,073 and for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (August 31, 2018) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $29,560 as of July 31, 2022 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand and loans from directors and/or private placement of common stock.\nNOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company are presented in US dollars and the Company has adopted a July 31 fiscal year end.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents to the extent the funds are not being held for investment purposes.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nASC 820 \"Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures\" establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs in measuring fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable in the market.\nThese tiers include:\nLevel 1: defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2: defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel 3: defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions.\nThe carrying value of cash and the Company's loan from shareholder approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, the Company assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, the Company recognizes an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated life of the asset, which is 3 years.\nIntangible Asset\nThe Company accounts for its intangible assets in accordance with ASC Subtopic 350-40, Internal-Use Software-Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use, and ASC Subtopic 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. ASC Subtopic 350-40 requires assets to be recorded at the cost to develop the asset and requires an intangible asset to be amortized over its useful life and for the useful life to be evaluated every reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. If the estimate of useful life is changed the remaining carrying amount of the intangible asset is amortized prospectively over the revised remaining useful life.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022 the Company capitalized website development costs of $6,325, which is being amortized over a 3 year life, and recognized $1,780 worth of amortization expense. The Company also purchased video recording software at a cost of $10,000, which will be amortized over three years. As of July 31, 2022, the software was amortized in the amount of $417. The Company expects to recognize amortization expense of $5,442 annually for the next two fiscal years and $3,244 of amortization expense in the fiscal year ending July 31, 2025.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract with the customer. Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. Step 3: Determine the transaction price. Step 4. Allocate the transaction price. Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.\nThe Companys revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as ownership of software (when it is approved by the customer) is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. The Company shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations if such failure is due to circumstances beyond its reasonable control. Any liability of the Company shall be limited to the total of all amounts paid by the customer for services under the contract.\nThe Company plans to collect payment from customers prior to transferring ownership of the software and may require deposits from customers at the time an order is placed. When deposits are collected prior to transferring ownership of the software the Company recognizes deferred revenue until the transfer is made. As of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's revenue was $4,050 and $0, respectively.\nBasic Income (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company computes earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260-10-45 'Earnings per Share, which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net earnings (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive earnings (loss) per share excludes al potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. The Company has no potential dilutive instruments, and therefore, basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share are equal.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe Company has reviewed all the recent accounting pronouncements issued to date of the issuance of these financial statements, and does not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the companys financial reporting.\nNOTE 4 - COMMON STOCK\nThe Company has 75,000,000 common shares authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.\nOn May 20, 2021 the Company issued 4,500,000 shares of its common stock at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $4,500 to a related party (see NOTE 5).\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had 4,500,000 shares issued and outstanding.\nNOTE 5 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nIn support of the Companys efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders or directors. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities.\nEffective August 31, 2018 the Companys CEO and sole director formally agreed to advance funds to the Company to pay for professional fees and operating expenses under a $50,000 Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement is non-binding and discretionary, bears no interest, is unsecured, and has no fixed due date, therefore it is considered due on demand.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022, using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO - 2013\").\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.\n1.We lack an adequate internal control structure - Due to the size of the Company we do not have the appropriate control activities, risk assessment procedures, controls over information and communication, or effective monitoring controls.\n2.We do not have appropriate segregation of duties - The Company has only one employee therefore no reviews are in place to ensure adequate finanicial reporting. Further, while not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the managements view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Companys financial statements. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over managements activities.\n3. We do not have adequate accounting resources - The Company has only one employee, therefore we lack accounting personnel with sufficient accounting knowledge, experience, and understanding of US GAAP or SEC rules.\n4.We do not have appropriate information technology controls - The Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however, there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Companys data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors. Further there are no IT controls in place to prevent changes to, or misstatement in, financial reporting.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the year ended July 31, 2022, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
