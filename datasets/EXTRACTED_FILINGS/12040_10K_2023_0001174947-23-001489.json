    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nAs of September 30, 2023, Flanigans Enterprises, Inc., a Florida corporation, together with its subsidiaries (we, our, ours and us as the context requires), (i) operates 31 units, consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores, combination restaurant/package liquor stores and a sports bar that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and franchises an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurant/package liquor stores. The table below provides information concerning the type (i.e. restaurant, sports bar, package liquor store or combination restaurant/package liquor store) and ownership of the units (i.e. whether (i) we own 100% of the unit; (ii) the unit is owned by a limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and/or have invested in; or (iii) the unit is franchised by us), as of September 30, 2023 and as compared to October 1, 2022. With the exception of The Whales Rib, a restaurant we operate but do not own, and Brendans Sports Pub a restaurant/bar we own, all of the restaurants operate under our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans and all of the package liquor stores operate under our service marks Big Daddys Liquors or Big Daddys Wine & Liquors.\nTYPES OF UNITS\nFISCAL YEAR\nFISCAL YEAR\nCompany Owned:\nCombination package liquor store and restaurant\nRestaurant only, including sports bar (1)\nPackage liquor store only (2) (3)\nCompany Managed Restaurants Only:\nLimited partnerships (4)\nFranchise\nUnrelated Third Party\nTotal Company Owned/Operated Units\nFranchised Units (5)\n____________________\nNotes:\n(1) During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into a new lease for the business premises and purchased the assets of a restaurant/bar known as Brendans Sports Pub located at 868 S. Federal Highway, Pompano Beach, Florida and began operating the location under its current trade name.\n(2) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire which has caused it to be closed since the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we opened our newly built stand-alone package liquor store on this site replacing our package liquor store destroyed by fire and previously operating here (Store #19P). We are constructing a stand-alone restaurant building on this site (adjacent to the package liquor store), replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire and previously operating here (Store #19R). This restaurant was not operational during our fiscal year 2023, but we believe this restaurant will be operational during our fiscal year 2024.\n(3) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023, our package liquor store located at 11225 Miramar Parkway #245, Miramar, Florida (Store #24) opened for business.\n(4) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 14301 West Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) opened for business (the 2022 Sunrise Restaurant). During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 11225 Miramar Parkway #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #25) opened for business (the 2023 Miramar Restaurant).\n(5) We operate a restaurant for one (1) franchisee. This unit is included in the table both as a franchised restaurant, as well as a restaurant operated by us.\nHistory and Development of Our Business\nWe were incorporated in Florida in 1959 and commenced operating as a chain of small cocktail lounges and package liquor stores throughout South Florida. By 1970, we had established a chain of \"Big Daddy's\" lounges and package liquor stores between Vero Beach and Homestead, Florida. From 1970 to 1979, we expanded our package liquor store and lounge operations throughout Florida and opened clubs in five other \"Sun Belt\" states. In 1975, we discontinued most of our package store operations in Florida except in the South Florida areas of Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Monroe Counties. In 1982, we expanded our club operations into the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area as general partner of several limited partnerships we organized. In March 1985, we began franchising package liquor stores and lounges in the South Florida area. (See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion of franchised units on pages 3 and 4).\nDuring our fiscal year 1987, we began renovating our lounges to provide full restaurant food service, and subsequently renovated and added food service to most of our lounges. Food sales currently represent approximately 78.71% and bar sales approximately 21.29% of our total restaurant sales.\nOur package liquor stores emphasize high volume business by providing customers with a wide variety of brand name and private label merchandise at discount prices. Our restaurants and our new sports bar establishment offer alcoholic beverages and food service with abundant portions and reasonable prices, served in a relaxed, friendly and casual atmosphere.\nWe conduct our operations directly and through a number of limited partnerships and wholly owned subsidiaries, all of which are listed below. Our subsidiaries and the limited partnerships, (except for the limited partnership, where we are not the general partner, which owns and operates our franchised restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida) are reported on a consolidated basis.\nEntity\nState Of\nOrganization\nPercentage\nOwned\nFlanigans Management Services, Inc.

We provide sales training to our package liquor store personnel. The stores are open for business seven days a week from 9:00-10:00 a.m. to 9:00-10:00 p.m., depending upon demand and local law. Most of our units have \"night windows\" with extended evening hours.\nCompany-Owned Package Liquor Stores. As of our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we own and operate eleven package liquor stores in the South Florida area under the name Big Daddys Liquors or Big Daddys Wine & Liquors, two of which are jointly operated with restaurants we own.\nFranchised Package Liquor Stores. We currently franchise three package liquor stores, all in the South Florida area, all of which are operated under the name Big Daddys Liquors. Of the three franchised package liquor stores, two are jointly operated with our franchisees restaurant operations and one is operated in a freestanding building adjacent to the franchisees restaurant operation. Two of the three franchised package liquor stores are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future.\nGenerally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a package liquor store runs for the balance of the term of the franchisees lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisees continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, Big Daddys Liquors, franchisees of package liquor stores pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 1% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales generated at the stores depending upon our actual advertising costs.\nFor accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees.\nRestaurant Operations\nOur restaurants provide a neighborhood casual, standardized dining experience, typical of casual restaurant chains. The interior decor of the restaurants is nautical with numerous fishing and boating pictures and decorations. The restaurants are designed to permit minor modifications without significant capital expenditures. However, from time to time we are required to redesign and refurbish the restaurants at significant cost. Drink prices may vary between locations to meet local conditions. Food prices are substantially standardized for all restaurants. The restaurants' hours of operation are from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00-5:00 a.m. depending upon demand and local law.\nCompany-Owned Restaurants. We own and operate nine restaurants all under our service mark Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill three of which are jointly operated with package liquor stores we own. We are constructing a stand-alone restaurant to be located in Hollywood, Florida to replace our restaurant destroyed by fire. We believe this restaurant will be operational during our fiscal year 2024.\nFranchised Restaurants. We franchise five restaurants, all of which operate under our service mark Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill, two of which operate as a restaurant only, two of which operate jointly with a franchisee operated Big Daddys Liquors package liquor store and one of which operates adjacent to a Big Daddys Liquors package liquor store. Four of the five franchised restaurants are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors. We have not entered into a franchise arrangement for either a package liquor store, restaurant or combination package liquor store/restaurant since 1986 and do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future.\nGenerally, a franchise agreement with our franchisees for the operation of a restaurant runs for the balance of the term of the franchisees lease for the business premises, extended by the franchisees continued occupancy of the business premises thereafter, whether by lease or ownership. In exchange for our providing management and related services to the franchisee and our granting the right to the franchisee to use our service mark, Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill, our franchisees pay us weekly in arrears, (i) a royalty equal to approximately 3% of gross sales; plus (ii) an amount for advertising equal to between 1-1/2% to 3% of gross sales from the restaurants depending upon our actual advertising costs.\nFor accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the revenue and expenses of our franchisees operations with our revenue and expenses. Franchise royalties we receive are recognized as revenue when sales are made by franchisees.\nRestaurants Owned by Affiliated Limited Partnerships\nWe have invested along with others, (some of whom are or are affiliated with our officers and directors), in eleven limited partnerships which currently own and operate eleven South Florida based restaurants under our service mark Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill. In addition to being a limited partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of ten of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of these restaurants. We are only a limited partner in the limited partnership which owns and operates the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.\nGenerally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, (available cash is distributed to the investors pro-rata based on ownership interest), the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (\u00bd) to us as a management fee and one-half (\u00bd) to the investors, (including us), pro-rata based on the investors investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors, (including us), have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (\u00bd) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one-half (\u00bd) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us), as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors investment. As of September 30, 2023, all limited partnerships, with the exception of the 2022 Sunrise Restaurant, which opened for business in March, 2022 and the 2023 Miramar Restaurant, which opened for business in April, 2023, have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (\u00bd) of the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans, which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3% fee is earned when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants under development in the future will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.\nBelow is information on the eleven limited partnerships which own and operate Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans restaurants:\nSurfside, Florida\nWe are the sole general partner and a 46% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Surfside, Florida under our Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill service mark since March 6, 1998. 33.3% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members.

As of the end of our fiscal year 2023, this limited partnership has returned to its investors approximately 10.0% of their initial cash invested.\nFort Lauderdale, Florida\nA corporation owned by one of our board members acts as sole general partner of a limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Fort Lauderdale, Florida under our Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill service mark since April 1, 1997. We have a 25% limited partnership interest in this limited partnership. 31.9% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members. This limited partnership has returned to its investors all cash invested, but since we are not the general partner of this limited partnership, we do not receive an annual management fee. We have a franchise arrangement with this limited partnership and for accounting purposes, we do not consolidate the operations of this limited partnership into our operations.\nManagement Agreement for The Whales Rib Restaurant\nSince January 2006, we have managed The Whales Rib, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement. We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us. In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (\u00bd) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant. For our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, we generated $400,000 of revenue each fiscal year from providing these management services.\nOperations and Management\nWe emphasize systematic operations and control of all package liquor stores and restaurants regardless of whether we own, franchise or manage the unit. Each unit has its own manager who is responsible for monitoring inventory levels, supervising sales personnel, food preparation and service in restaurants and generally assuring that the unit is managed in accordance with our guidelines and procedures. We have in effect an incentive cash bonus program for our managers and salespersons based upon various performance criteria. Our operations are supervised by supervisors, who visit all Company, limited partnership and franchise owned units and the managed unit to provide on-site management and support. There are three supervisors responsible for package liquor store operations and six supervisors responsible for restaurant operations.\nAll of our managers and salespersons receive extensive training in sales techniques. We arrange for independent third parties, or \"shoppers\", to inspect each unit in order to evaluate the unit's operations, including the handling of cash transactions.\nPurchasing and Inventory\nThe package liquor business requires a constant substantial capital investment in inventory at the stores. Our inventory consists primarily of liquor and wine products and as such, does not become excessive or obsolete that would require identifying and recording of the same. Liquor inventory purchased can normally be returned only if defective or broken.\nAll of our purchases of liquor inventory are made through our purchasing department from our corporate headquarters. The major portion of inventory is purchased under individual purchase orders with licensed wholesalers and distributors who deliver the merchandise within one or two days of the placing of an order. Frequently there is only one wholesaler in the immediate marketing area with an exclusive distributorship of certain liquor product lines. Substantially all of our liquor inventory is shipped by the wholesalers or distributors directly to our stores. We significantly increase our inventory prior to Christmas, New Year's Eve and other holidays. Under Florida law, we are required to pay for our liquor purchases within ten days of delivery.\nNegotiations with food suppliers are conducted by our purchasing department at our corporate headquarters. We believe this ensures that the best quality and prices will be available to each restaurant. Orders for food products are prepared by each restaurant's kitchen manager and reviewed by the restaurant's general manager before orders are placed. Food is delivered by the supplier directly to each restaurant. Orders are placed several times a week to ensure product freshness. Food inventory is primarily paid for monthly. We purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations based on market prices established with our suppliers. Many of the food products purchased by us can be subject to price volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control. We mitigate the risk of supply shortages and obtain competitive prices by utilizing multiple qualified suppliers for substantially all our food products.\nWe negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for certain of our principal food product requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. We evaluate the possibility of entering into arrangements to assist us in managing risk and variability associated with the supply and demand of food products.\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $6.8 million and $7.0 million of 2.25 & Down Baby Back Ribs (industry jargon for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar years 2023 and 2024 respectively, at prescribed costs, which we believe are competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024 compared to calendar year 2023 is due to our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year and Store #19, Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price.\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.\nInformation Technology\nOur restaurant and package liquor store point-of-sale and back-office systems provide information regarding daily sales, cash receipts, inventory, food and beverage costs, labor costs and other controllable operating expenses. Our restaurants and package liquor stores offer online ordering for to-go sales and our package liquor stores also offer delivery services by third-party vendors.\nRestaurant and package liquor store hardware and software support is provided by both our internal support services team as well as third-party vendors. Each restaurant and package liquor store has a private high-speed wide area connection to send and receive critical business data as well as to access web-based applications securely as well as a failover capability. All of our core and critical applications are backed up to external data centers. To mitigate business interruptions, we utilize a data backup and replication infrastructure between our onsite and external data centers, so all data is replicated nightly between the sites.\nWe require cybersecurity awareness training for all staff members with access to our cyber systems. We also maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to further reduce our risk profile. Security of our financial data and other sensitive information remains a high priority for us, led by our information technology department. In an effort to further secure our customers credit card information, we employ an encryption and tokenization platform for all credit card transactions in our restaurants, ensuring no credit card data is stored in our internal systems. We also transact business through online ordering for both our restaurants and package liquor stores through third party vendors. (See ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. These risks should be considered carefully with the uncertainties described below, and all other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to management or that management currently deems immaterial and therefore not referenced herein, may also become material and may harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks and uncertainties and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nCertain statements in this report contain forward-looking information. In general, forward-looking statements include estimates of future revenues, cash flow, capital expenditures, or other financial items and assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements reflect managements current expectations regarding future events and use words such as anticipate, believe, expect, may, will and other similar terminology. These statements speak only as of the date they were made and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Several factors, many beyond our control, could cause actual results to differ materially from managements expectations. New risks and uncertainties arise from time to time, and we cannot predict when they may arise or how they may affect us. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this report as a result of new information, future events or other developments, except as required by applicable laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 Pandemic Has Had A Significant Impact On Our Operations Since March 2020 And Could Materially And Adversely Affect Our Future Business And Financial Results.\nIn March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic and related suggested and mandated social distancing and shelter-in-place orders and other governmental mandates relating thereto (collectively, COVID-19) caused significant disruptions to our business, adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future, particularly if further government directives are put in place for a significant amount of time. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023.\nWe have experienced significant issues relating to suppliers and labor impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If our suppliers employees are unable to work, whether because of illness, quarantine, limitations on travel or other government restrictions in connection with COVID-19, or if the supply chain is disrupted for any other reason such as travel limitations and other restrictions on commerce, we could face shortages of food items or other supplies at our restaurants and our operations and sales could be adversely impacted by such supply interruptions.\nThe impact of COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, may also precipitate or exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A - Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report, any of which could have a material effect on us. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business and financial condition will be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nIf we are unable to staff and retain qualified restaurant and package liquor store management and operating personnel in an increasingly competitive market, we may be unable to effectively operate and grow our business and revenues, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nSimilar to the broader economy, we are experiencing labor shortfalls relative to our sales levels in certain parts of our workforce. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified people, our restaurants could be short staffed, we may be forced to incur overtime expenses, and our ability to operate and expand our concepts effectively and to meet our customers demand could be limited, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience significant labor cost inflation. If we are unable to offset higher labor costs, our cost of doing business will significantly increase, which could materially adversely impact our financial performance.\nIncreases in minimum wages and minimum tip credit wages, extensions of personal and other leave policies, other governmental regulations affecting labor costs and a diminishing pool of potential staff members when the unemployment rate falls and legal immigration is restricted, especially in certain localities, could significantly increase our labor costs and make it more difficult to fully staff our restaurants, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe believe the United States federal government may significantly increase the federal minimum wage and tip credit wage (or eliminate the tip credit wage) and require significantly more mandated benefits than what is currently required under federal law. The State of Florida has already enacted a minimum wage and tip credit, with the minimum wage currently at $12.00 per hour and a tip credit of $3.02 per hour. The minimum wage increases $1.00 per hour annually until it reaches $15.00 per hour in 2027. The tip credit does not increase. In addition to increasing the overall wages paid to our minimum wage and tip credit wage earners, these increases create pressure to increase wages and other benefits paid to other staff members who, in recognition of their tenure, performance, job responsibilities and other similar considerations, historically received a rate of pay exceeding the applicable minimum wage or minimum tip credit wage. Because we employ a large workforce, any wage increase and/or expansion of benefits mandates will have a particularly significant impact on our labor costs. Our vendors, contractors and business partners are similarly impacted by wage and benefit cost inflation, and many have or will increase their price for goods, construction and services in order to offset their increasing labor costs. Additionally, while our employees are not currently covered by any collective bargaining agreements, union organizers may engage in efforts to organize our employees and those of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to unionize, our labor costs could increase and it could negatively impact our culture, reduce our flexibility and disrupt our business. In addition, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact our reputation and dissuade guests from patronizing our restaurants.\nOur labor expenses include significant costs related to our health benefit plans. Health care costs continue to rise and are especially difficult to project. Material increases in costs associated with medical claims, or an increase in the severity or frequency of such claims, may cause health care costs to vary substantially from year-over-year. Given the unpredictable nature of actual health care claims trends, including the severity or frequency of claims, in any given year our health care costs could significantly exceed our estimates, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nAny significant changes to the healthcare insurance system could impact our healthcare costs. Material increases in healthcare costs could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWhile we try to offset labor cost increases through price increases, more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. If we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond to increased labor costs, our financial performance could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Sales and Profit Growth Could Be Adversely Affected If Comparable Restaurant Sales Increases Are Less Than We Expect, and We May Not Successfully Increase Comparable Restaurant Sales or They May Decrease.\nWhile future sales growth will depend substantially on our opening new restaurants, changes in comparable restaurant sales (which represent the change in period-over-period sales for restaurants) will also affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting profit growth. This is because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher, as comparable restaurant sales increases enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher sales base. Conversely, declines in comparable restaurant sales can have a significant adverse effect on profitability due to the loss of the positive impact on profit margins associated with comparable restaurant sales increases. There is no assurance that comparable restaurant sales will increase in fiscal year 2024 due to, among other things, ongoing consumer and economic uncertainty.\nOur ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends on many factors, including:\n\u25cf perceptions of the Flanigans brand;\n\u25cf competition, especially from an increasing number of competitors in the fast casual segment of the restaurant industry and from other restaurants whose strategies overlap ours, as well as from grocery stores, meal kit delivery services and other dining options;\n\u25cf executing our strategies effectively, including our marketing and branding strategies;\n\u25cf changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u25cf our ability to increase menu prices without adversely affecting our existing business;\n\u25cf weather, natural disasters and other factors limiting access to our restaurants; and\n\u25cf changes in government regulation that may impact customer perceptions of our food.\nAs a result, it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable restaurant sales or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative. A number of these factors are beyond our control and therefore we cannot assure that we will be able to sustain comparable restaurant sales increases.\nHigh Unemployment, Instability in the Housing Market, High Energy and Food Costs and General Economic Uncertainty Could Result in a Decline in Consumer Discretionary Spending That Would Materially Affect our Financial Performance.\nCOVID-19 has had a significant impact on domestic economies and will likely continue to negatively impact these economies for some time. Dining out is a discretionary expense. In addition to COVID-19, factors that affect consumer behavior and spending for restaurant dining, such as changes in general economic conditions (including national, regional and local economic conditions), discretionary spending patterns, employment levels, instability in the housing market, and high energy and food costs may have a material adverse effect on us. If economic conditions worsen, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\nIntense Competition In The Restaurant And Package Liquor Store Industry Could Prevent Us From Increasing Or Sustaining Our Revenues And Profitability.\nThe restaurant and package liquor store industry is intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price-value relationships, ambiance, service and location and many restaurants and package liquor stores compete with us at each of our locations. There are a number of well-established competitors with substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than ours, and many of our competitors are well established in the markets where we have restaurants and/or stores or where we intend to locate restaurants. Additionally, other companies may develop restaurants and/or stores that operate with similar concepts.\nAny inability to compete successfully with the other restaurants and/or stores in our markets will prevent us from increasing or sustaining our revenues and profitability and will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We may also need to modify or refine elements of our business to evolve our concepts in order to compete with popular new restaurant formats or store concepts that may develop in the future. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing these modifications or that these modifications will not reduce our profitability.\nNew Information Or Attitudes Regarding Diet And Health Could Result In Changes In Regulations And Consumer Eating Habits That Could Adversely Affect Our Revenues.\nRegulations and consumer eating habits may change because of new information or attitudes regarding diet and health. These changes may include regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items at our restaurants. For example, a number of states, counties and cities are enacting menu-labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to make certain nutritional information available to guests or restrict the sales of certain types of ingredients in restaurants. The success of our restaurant operations is dependent, in part, upon our ability to respond effectively to changes in consumer health and disclosure regulations and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. If consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or delete certain menu items. To the extent we are unable to respond with appropriate changes to our menu offerings, it could materially affect customer demand and have an adverse impact on our revenues.\nAdverse Public Or Medical Opinions About Health Effects Of Consuming Our Products As Well As Negative Publicity About Us, Our Restaurants And/Or Package Liquor Stores And About Others Across The Food And Liquor Industry Supply Chain, Whether Or Not Accurate, Could Negatively Affect Us.\nRestaurant operators have received more scrutiny from regulators and health organizations in recent years relating to the health effects of consuming certain products. An unfavorable report on the products we use in our menu, the size of our portions or the consumption of those items could influence the demand for our offerings. In addition, adverse publicity or news reports, whether or not accurate, of food quality issues, illness, injury, health concerns, or operating issues stemming from a single restaurant, a limited number of restaurants, restaurants operated by others or generally in the food supply chain could be damaging to the restaurant industry overall and specifically harm our reputation. A decrease in guest traffic because of these types of health concerns or negative publicity could materially harm our results of operations.\nOur Inability To Successfully And Sufficiently Raise Menu Prices Could Result In A Decline In Profitability.\nWe utilize menu price increases to help offset cost increases, including increased cost for commodities, minimum wages, employee benefits, insurance arrangements, construction, utilities and other key operating costs. If our selection and amount of menu price increases are not accepted by consumers and reduce guest traffic, or are insufficient to counter increased costs, our financial results could be negatively affected. However, we have not experienced any adverse effects from past menu price increases.\nIncreases in Food Costs, Raw Materials and Other Supplies and Services Due to Inflation May Have a Material Adverse Impact on our Financial Performance.\nOur operating margins depend on, among other things, our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverage costs, utilities and other supplies and services due to inflation. We attempt to negotiate short-term and long-term agreements for our principal commodity, supply and equipment requirements, depending on market conditions and expected demand. However, we are currently unable to contract for extended periods of time for certain of our commodities. Consequently, these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations due to factors such as changes in demand patterns, increases in the cost of key inputs, fuel costs, weather and other market conditions outside of our control caused by inflation. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Our suppliers also may be affected by higher costs to produce and transport commodities used in our restaurants, higher minimum wage and benefit costs, and other expenses that they pass through to their customers, which could result in higher costs for goods and services supplied to us.\nShortages or Interruptions in the Supply of Food Offering Ingredients and/or Liquor Inventory Could Adversely Affect our Operating Results.\nOur business is dependent on frequent and consistent deliveries of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory. We may experience shortages, delays or interruptions in the supply of ingredients and other supplies to our restaurants due to inclement weather, natural disasters, labor issues or other operational disruptions at our suppliers, distributors or transportation providers or other conditions beyond our control. In addition, we have a single or a limited number of suppliers for some of our ingredients, including baby back ribs. Although we believe we have potential alternative suppliers and sufficient reserves of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory, shortages or interruptions in our supply of food offering ingredients and liquor inventory could adversely affect our financial results.\nOur Business Could Be Materially Adversely Affected If We Are Unable To Expand In A Timely And Profitable Manner.\nTo grow successfully, we must open new restaurants and/or package liquor stores on a timely and profitable basis. We have experienced delays in restaurant and/or package liquor store openings from time to time and may experience delays in the future. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened our new limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) for business, as well as our company owned package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) and our newly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business, replacing our package liquor store destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building on the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site (Store #19R). We anticipate that the restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) will open for business in March 2024.\nOur ability to open and profitably operate restaurants and/or package liquor stores is subject to various risks such as identification and availability of suitable and economically viable locations, the negotiation of acceptable leases or the purchase terms of existing locations, the availability of limited partner investors or other means to raise capital, the need to obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals) on a timely basis, the need to comply with other regulatory requirements, the availability of necessary contractors and subcontractors, the availability of construction materials and labor, the ability to meet construction schedules and budgets, variations in labor and building material costs, changes in weather or other acts of God that could result in construction delays and adversely affect the results of one or more restaurants and/or package liquor stores for an indeterminate amount of time. If we are unable to manage these risks successfully, we will face increased costs and lower than anticipated revenues which will materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nChanges In Customer Preferences For Casual Dining Styles Could Adversely Affect Financial Performance.\nChanging customer preferences, tastes and dietary habits can adversely impact our business and financial performance. We offer a large variety of entrees, side dishes and desserts and our continued success depends, in part, on the popularity of our cuisine and casual style of dining. A change from this dining style may have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur Success Depends Substantially on the Value of our Brands and our Reputation for Offering Guests a Satisfactory Experience.\nWe believe we have built a reasonably strong reputation for the predictability of our menu items, as part of the experience that guests enjoy in our restaurants. We believe we must protect and grow the value of our brands to continue to be successful in the future. Any incident that erodes consumer trust in or affinity for our brands could be harmful to us. If consumers perceive or experience a reduction in food quality, service or ambiance, or in any way believe we failed to deliver a consistently positive experience, our brand value could suffer.\nOur Marketing And Advertising Strategies May Not Be Successful, Which Could Adversely Impact Our Business.\nFrom time to time, we introduce new advertising campaigns and media strategies. If our advertising campaign and new media strategies do not resonate with customers in the manner we hope, they may not result in increased sales, but would still increase our expenses. We will continue to invest in marketing and advertising strategies that we believe will attract customers or increase their connection with our brand. If these marketing and advertising investments do not drive increased restaurant and/or package store sales, the expense associated with these programs will adversely impact our financial results, and we may not generate the levels of comparable sales we expect.\nLabor Shortages, An Increase In Labor Costs, Or Inability To Attract Employees Could Harm Our Business.\nOur employees are essential to our operations and our ability to deliver an enjoyable dining experience to our customers. If we are unable to attract and retain enough qualified restaurant and/or package liquor store personnel at a reasonable cost, and if they do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience, our results may be negatively affected. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages, which could result in higher labor costs.\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, Restaurants Are Subject To Climate Conditions That Could Affect Operations.\nAll but one (1) of our restaurants and package liquor stores are located in South Florida, with the remaining restaurant located in Central Florida. During hurricane season, (June 1 through November 30 each year), our restaurants and/or package liquor stores may face harsh weather associated with hurricanes and tropical storms. These harsh weather conditions may make it more difficult for customers to visit our restaurants and package liquor stores or may necessitate the closure of the stores and restaurants for a period of time. If customers are unable to visit our restaurants and/or package liquor stores, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected.\nIf We Were to Experience Widespread Difficulty Renewing Existing Leases on Favorable Terms, Our Revenue or Occupancy Costs Could be Adversely Affected.\nMost of the properties on which we operate restaurants are leased from third parties, and some of our leases are due for renewal or extension options in the next several years. Some leases expire without any renewal options. While we currently expect to pursue the renewal of substantially all of our expiring restaurant leases, any difficulty renewing a significant number of such leases, or any substantial increase in rents associated with lease renewals, could adversely impact us. If we have to close any restaurants due to difficulties in renewing leases, we would lose revenue from the affected restaurants and may not be able to open suitable replacement restaurants. Substantial increases in rents associated with lease renewals would increase our occupancy costs, reducing our restaurant margins.\nDue To Our Geographic Locations, We May Not Be Able To Acquire Windstorm Insurance Coverage Or Adequate Windstorm Insurance Coverage At A Reasonable Rate.\nDue to the anticipated active hurricane seasons in South Florida in the future, we may not be able to acquire windstorm insurance coverage for our restaurant and package liquor store locations on a year-to-year basis or may not be able to get adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates. If we are unable to obtain windstorm insurance coverage or adequate windstorm insurance coverage at reasonable rates, then we will be self-insured for all or a part of the exposure for damages caused by a hurricane impacting South Florida, which may have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. We secured windstorm insurance coverage for the period commencing December 30, 2023 at a higher premium. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of windstorm insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.\nOur Inability or Failure to Execute a Comprehensive Business Continuity Plan at our Restaurant Support Centers Following a Disaster or Force Majeure Event could have a Material Adverse Impact on our Business.\nMany of our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant and package liquor store operations are centralized at one location. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address crisis-level events, including hurricanes and other natural disasters and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information and the COVID-19 pandemic has provided a limited test of our ability to manage our business remotely. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims. In addition, these threats are constantly evolving, which increases the difficulty of accurately and timely predicting, planning for and protecting against the threat. As a result, our disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans security may not adequately address all threats we face or protect us from loss.\nInability To Attract And Retain Customers Could Affect Results Of Operations.\nWe take pride in our ability to attract and retain customers, however, if we do not deliver an enjoyable dining experience for our customers, they may not return and results may be negatively affected.\nA Failure To Comply With Governmental Regulations Could Harm Our Business And Our Reputation.\nWe are subject to regulation by federal agencies and regulation by state and local health, sanitation, building, zoning, safety, fire and other departments relating to the development and operation of restaurants. These regulations include matters relating to the following:\n\u25cf the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages;\n\u25cf employment;\n\u25cf building construction and access;\n\u25cf zoning requirements; and\n\u25cf the environment.\nOur facilities are licensed and subject to regulation under state and local fire, health and safety codes. The construction and remodeling of restaurants will be subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental regulations. We may not be able to obtain necessary licenses or other approvals on a cost-effective and timely basis in order to construct and develop restaurants in the future.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our operations and our relationship with our employees, minimum wage, overtime, working conditions, fringe benefit and work authorization requirements. In particular, we are subject to federal immigration regulations. Given the location of many of our restaurants, even if we operate those restaurants in strict compliance with federal immigration requirements, our employees may not all meet federal work authorization or residency requirements, which could lead to disruptions in our work force.\nOur business can be adversely affected by negative publicity resulting from, among other things, complaints or litigation alleging poor food quality, food-borne illness or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. Unfavorable publicity could negatively impact public perception of our brands.\nWe are required to comply with the alcohol licensing requirements of the federal government, states and municipalities where our restaurants are located. Alcoholic beverage control regulations require applications to state authorities and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities for a license and permit to sell alcoholic beverages. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of the restaurants, including minimum age of guests and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. If we fail to comply with federal, state or local regulations, our licenses may be revoked and we may be forced to terminate the sale of alcoholic beverages at one or more of our restaurants.\nThe Federal Americans with Disabilities Act (the ADA) prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. We are required to comply with the ADA and regulations relating to accommodating the needs of disabled persons in connection with the construction of new facilities and with significant renovations of existing facilities.\nFailure to comply with these and other regulations could negatively impact our reputation and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe May Face Liability Under Dram Shop Statutes.\nOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage, or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. There are currently no dram shop claims pending against us. See Item 1. Business-Government Regulation for a discussion of the regulations with which we must comply.\nConcerns relating to pandemics and other diseases, food safety and food-borne illness could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, disrupt our food supply chain or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant adverse impact on our customer traffic and ability to operate our restaurants and may do so again in the foreseeable future. Future pandemics and other diseases may have a similar or more severe impact.\nIn years past, several nationally known restaurants experienced outbreaks of food poisoning believed to be caused by E.coli contained in fresh spinach, which is not included in any of the items on our menu, Asian and European countries experienced outbreaks of avian flu and incidents of mad cow disease have occurred in Canadian and U.S. cattle herds. These problems, other food-borne illnesses (such as, hepatitis A, trichinosis or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past, and could in the future, adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause changes in consumer preference. As a result, our sales could decline.\nInstances of food-borne illnesses, real or perceived, whether at our restaurants or those of our competitors, could also result in negative publicity about us or the restaurant industry, which could adversely affect sales. If we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the dining experience we offer, we may lose customers who do not accept those changes and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. If our guests become ill from food-borne illnesses, we could be forced to temporarily close some restaurants. A decrease in guest traffic as a result of health concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our restaurants, could materially harm our business.\nIf We Are Unable To Protect Our Customers Credit Card Data, We Could Be Exposed To Data Loss, Litigation And Liability, And Our Reputation Could Be Significantly Harmed.\nIn connection with credit card sales, we transmit confidential credit card information by way of secure private retail networks. Although we use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security of the customer information transmitted in connection with credit card sales, and our security measures and those of our technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person is able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our operations. Any security breach could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, and liability, and could seriously disrupt our operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We have not experienced any security breaches to date.\nIf We Experience a Significant Failure in or Interruption of Certain Key Information Technology Systems, our Business Could Be Adversely Impacted.\nWe use a variety of applications and systems to manage the flow of information securely within each of our restaurants and within our centralized corporate infrastructure. The services available within our systems and applications include restaurant and store operations, supply chain, inventory, scheduling, training, human capital management, financial tools and data protection services. The restaurant and store structure is based primarily on a point-of-sale system that operates locally and is integrated with other functions necessary to operations. It records sales transactions, receives out of store orders and authorizes, batches and transmits credit card transactions. The system also allows employees to enter time clock information and to produce a variety of management reports. Select information that is captured from this system at each restaurant or store is collected in the central corporate infrastructure, which enables management to continually monitor operating results. Our ability to manage efficiently and effectively our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these and other systems and our operations depend substantially on the availability of our point-of-sale system and related networks and applications. These systems may be vulnerable to attacks or outages from security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems, as well as from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Any failure of these systems to operate effectively, whether from security breaches, maintenance problems, upgrades or transitions to new platforms, or other factors could result in interruptions to or delays in our restaurant or other operations, adversely impacting the restaurant or store experience for our customers or negatively impacting our ability to manage our business. If our information technology systems fail and our redundant systems or disaster recovery plans are not adequate to address such failures, or if our business interruption insurance does not sufficiently compensate us for any losses that we may incur, our revenues and profits could be reduced and the reputation of our brand and our business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses.\nThe Effect of Recent Changes to U.S. Healthcare Laws May Increase Our Healthcare Costs and Negatively Impact Our Financial Results.\nWe offer eligible full-time employees the opportunity to enroll in healthcare coverage subsidized by the Company. For various reasons, many of our eligible employees currently choose not to participate in our healthcare plans. However, under the comprehensive U.S. health care reform law enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions, including, the employer mandate, may increase our labor costs significantly. In general, implementing the requirements of the Affordable Care Act is likely to impose additional administrative costs on us. The costs and other effects of these new healthcare requirements cannot be determined with certainty, but they may have a material adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nGovernmental Regulation in One or More of the Following Areas May Adversely Affect Our Existing and Future Operations and Results, Including by Harming Our Ability to Open New Restaurants or Increasing Our Operating Costs.\nEmployment and Immigration Regulations\nWe are subject to various federal and state laws governing our relationship with and other matters pertaining to our employees, including wage and hour laws, requirements to provide meal and rest periods or other benefits, healthcare, family leave mandates, requirements regarding working conditions and accommodations to certain employees, citizenship or work authorization and related requirements, insurance and workers compensation rules and anti-discrimination laws. Complying with these rules subjects us to substantial expense and can be cumbersome and can also expose us to liabilities from claims for non-compliance. For example, historically, lawsuits have been filed against us alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding employee wages and payment of overtime. We could suffer losses from and we incur legal costs to defend, these and similar cases and the amount of such losses or costs could be significant. In addition, several states and localities in which we operate and the federal government have from time to time enacted minimum wage increases, paid sick leave and mandatory vacation accruals and similar requirements and these changes could increase our labor costs. Changes in U.S. healthcare laws could also adversely impact us if they result in significant new welfare and benefit costs or increased compliance expenses.\nWe also are subject to being audited from time to time for compliance with citizenship or work authorization requirements. From time to time, the State of Florida considers adopting new state immigration laws and the U.S. Congress and Department of Homeland Security from time to time consider or implement changes to Federal immigration laws, regulations or enforcement programs as well. Changes in immigration or work authorization laws may increase our obligations for compliance and oversight, which could subject us to additional costs and make our hiring process more cumbersome or reduce the availability of potential employees. Although we require all workers to provide us with government-specified documentation evidencing their employment eligibility, some of our employees may, without our knowledge, be unauthorized workers. We currently participate in the E-Verify program, an Internet-based, free program run by the U.S. government to verify employment eligibility for all employees throughout our company. However, use of E-Verify does not guarantee that we will properly identify all applicants who are ineligible for employment. Unauthorized workers may subject us to fines or penalties and we could experience adverse publicity that negatively affects our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Termination of a significant number of employees would disrupt our operations including slowing our throughput and could also cause additional adverse publicity and temporary increases in our labor costs as we train new employees. We could also become subject to fines, penalties and other costs related to claims that we did not fully comply with all recordkeeping obligations of federal and state immigration compliance laws. Our reputation and financial performance may be materially harmed as a result of any of these factors.\nOn the other hand, in the event we wrongfully reject work authorization documents or if our compliance procedures are found to have a disparate impact on a protected class, such as a racial minority or based on the citizenship status of applicants, we could be found to be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. We could experience adverse publicity arising from enforcement activity related to work authorization compliance, anti-discrimination compliance, or both, that negatively impacts our brand and may make it more difficult to hire and keep qualified employees. Moreover, our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or difficulties in finding the right employees for our restaurants.\nAdditionally, while we do not currently have any unionized employees, union organizers have engaged in efforts to organize employees of other restaurant companies. If a significant portion of our employees were to become union organized, our labor costs could increase and our efforts to maintain a culture appealing only to top performing employees could be impaired. Potential changes in labor laws, including the possible passage of legislation designed to make it easier for employees to unionize, could increase the likelihood of some or all of our employees being subjected to greater organized labor influence and could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results by imposing requirements that could potentially increase our costs, reduce our flexibility and impact our employee culture.\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and Similar State Laws\nWe are subject to the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment, public accommodations and other areas. We have incurred legal fees in connection with ADA-related complaints in the past and we may in the future have to modify restaurants, for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural features, to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons under these laws. The expenses associated with these modifications or any damages, legal fees and costs associated with litigating or resolving claims under the ADA or similar state laws, could be material.\nNutrition and Food Regulation\nIn recent years there has been an increased legislative, regulatory and consumer focus at the federal, state and municipal levels on the food industry including nutrition and advertising practices. Restaurants operating in the quick-service and fast-casual segments have been a particular focus. For example, the State of California, New York City and a number of other jurisdictions around the U.S. have adopted regulations requiring that chain restaurants include calorie information on their menus and/or make other nutritional information available and nation-wide nutrition disclosure requirements included in the U.S. health care reform law went into effect as of December 1, 2015. These nutrition disclosure requirements may increase our expenses or slow customers as they select their food and beverage choices decreasing our throughput. These initiatives may also change customers buying habits in a way that adversely impacts our sales.\nPrivacy/Cybersecurity\nWe are required to collect and maintain personal information about our employees and we collect information about customers as part of some of our marketing programs as well. The collection and use of such information is regulated at the federal and state levels and the regulatory environment related to information security and privacy is increasingly demanding. If our security and information systems are compromised or if we otherwise fail to comply with these laws and regulations, we could face litigation and the imposition of penalties that could adversely affect our financial performance. Our reputation as a brand or as an employer could also be adversely affected from these types of security breaches or regulatory violations, which could impair our sales or ability to attract and keep qualified employees.\nLocal Licensure, Zoning and Other Regulation\nEach of our restaurants is also subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health, alcoholic beverage, sanitation, food and workplace safety and other agencies. We may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants, which could delay planned restaurant openings. In addition, stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning, use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations.\nEnvironmental Laws\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances, as well as local ordinances relating to our operations. We have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations. We cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future, how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with or to satisfy claims relating to environmental laws.\nWe Could Be Party To Litigation That Could Adversely Affect Us By Distracting Management, Increasing Our Expenses or Subjecting Us to Material Money Damages and Other Remedies.\nWe could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management, increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies. We could become subject to numerous claims alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment matters, including wages, work hours, overtime, vacation and family leave, discrimination, wrongful termination and similar matters, and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters. Our customers could file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our restaurants or that we have problems with food quality, operations or our food related disclosure or advertising practices. The restaurant industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products sold and disclosure and advertising practices.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are ultimately held liable for such claims, they may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance. A significant judgment for any claims against us could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations, whether directed at us or at fast casual or quick-service restaurants generally, may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects, which in turn could adversely affect our results.\nOur Success May Depend on the Continued Service and Availability of Key Personnel.\nOur Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and President, James Flanigan, has been the principal architect of our business strategy since 2002. August Bucci, Jeffrey Kastner and Christopher ONeil, our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Vice President of Package Operations, respectively, have also served with us since 2002 in the case of Mr. Bucci, since 2004 in the case of Mr. Kastner and 2016 in the case of Mr. ONeil, and much of our growth has occurred under their direction as well. We believe our executive officers have created an employee culture, food culture and business strategy at our company that has been critical to our success and that may be difficult to replicate under another management team. We also believe that it may be difficult to locate and retain executive officers who are able to grasp and implement our unique strategic vision. If our company culture were to deteriorate following a change in leadership, or if a new management team were to be unsuccessful in executing our strategy or were to change important elements of our current strategy, our growth prospects or future operating results may be adversely impacted.\nWe Are Exposed to Risks Related to Cybersecurity.\nAlthough we maintain systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security. Any material incidents could cause us to experience financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyberattacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. If our information security systems or data are compromised in a material way, our ability to conduct our business may be impaired, we may incur financial losses and we may incur costs to remediate possible harm and/or to pay fines or take other action which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIf There is a Material Failure in our Information Technology Systems, Our Business Operations and Profits Could Be Negatively Affected and our Systems may be Inadequate to Support our Future Growth Strategies.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems in all aspects of our operations including our restaurant point-of sale systems, financial systems, marketing programs, employee engagement, supply chain management, cyber-security, and various other processes and transactions. Our ability to effectively manage and run our business depends on the reliability and capacity of our information technology systems, including technology services and systems for which we contract from third parties. These systems and services may be insufficient to effectively manage and run our business. These systems and our business needs will continue to evolve and require upgrading and maintenance over time, consequently requiring significant future commitments of resources and capital.\nMoreover, these technology services and systems, communication systems, and electronic data could be subject or vulnerable to damage or interruption from hurricanes, terrorist attacks, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, loss of data, data breaches, or other attempts to harm our systems. A failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or any other failure to maintain a continuous and secure information technology network for any of the above reasons could result in interruption and delays in customer services, adversely affect our reputation, and negatively impact our results of operations.\nActs of Violence at or Threatened Against our Restaurants or the Centers in which they are Located, including Active Shooter Situations and Terrorism, Could Unfavorably Impact our Restaurant Sales, Which Could Materially Adversely Affect our Financial Performance.\nAny act of violence at or threatened against our restaurants or the centers in which they are located, including active shooter situations and terrorist activities, may result in restricted access to our restaurants and/or restaurant closures in the short-term and, in the long-term, may cause our customers and staff to avoid our restaurants. Any such situation could adversely impact customer traffic and make it more difficult to staff our restaurants fully, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nThe occurrence or threat of extraordinary events, such as active shooter or future terrorist attacks military and governmental responses, and the protest of future wars, may result in negative changes to economic conditions likely resulting in decreased consumer spending. Additionally, decreases in consumer discretionary spending may impact the frequency with which our customers choose to dine out at restaurants or the amount they spend on meals while dining out at restaurants, thereby adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also adversely affect our ability to achieve the benefit of planned menu price increases to help preserve our operating margins.\nSocial Media Impact on Customer Perceptions of our Brand.\nThe considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years can further amplify any negative publicity that may be generated. The adverse impact of publicity on customers perception of us could have a further negative impact on our sales. If the impact of any such publicity is particularly long-lasting, the value of our brand may suffer and our ability to grow could be diminished.\nOur Digital Business, Which Has Become an Increasingly Significant Part of Our Business, is Subject to Risks.\nPrimarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue derived from digital orders, which includes delivery and customer pickup has increased substantially. While we are uncertain as to whether this business will continue to increase and/or be significant, we have implemented technology, targeted advertising and promotions and to some extent remodeled our restaurants, to accommodate the growth of our digital business. If we do not continue to grow our digital business, it may be difficult for us to recoup these costs or achieve our sales growth potential. We rely on third-party delivery services to fulfill package store delivery orders, and the ordering and payment platforms used by these third-parties, or online ordering system, could be interrupted by technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks or other factors, which could adversely impact sales through these channels and negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, our delivery partners are responsible for order fulfillment and errors or failures to make timely deliveries could cause guests to stop ordering from us. The third-party delivery business is competitive, with a number of players competing for market share and delivery drivers. If the third-party delivery services that we utilize cease or curtail operations, increase their fees, or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our delivery business and our sales may be negatively impacted.\nOur Institutional Lender No Longer Originates, Renews or Modifies loans at LIBOR Effective January 1, 2022.\nEffective January 1, 2022, our institutional lender no longer originates, renews or modifies loans at LIBOR, except in limited situations. As of September 30, 2023, we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lenders BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum. As a means of managing our interest rate risk on the debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third party lender to convert this variable rate debt obligation to fixed rate.

We are no longer contingently liable on the lease.\n(3) In 1974, we sold and assigned the underlying ground lease to unaffiliated third parties and simultaneously subleased it back. We have re-purchased from the unaffiliated third parties and currently own 52% of the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement. As a result, we pay all rent due under the ground lease, but only 48% of the rent due under the sublease agreement.\n(4) Effective December 1, 1998, we purchased the Management Agreement to operate the franchised restaurant for the franchisee.\n(5) Ground lease executed by us on September 25, 2001. We constructed a 4,120 square foot building, of which 1,978 square feet is used by us for the operation of a package liquor store and the other 2,142 square feet is subleased to an unaffiliated third party as retail space. The package liquor store opened for business on November 17, 2003.\t\n(6) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2012, our wholly owned subsidiary, Flanigans Calusa Center, LLC, closed on the purchase of a two building shopping center in Miami, Florida, which consists of (i) one stand-alone building which is leased to ten unaffiliated third parties and houses our recently opened (October 2019) package liquor store (approximately 3,250 square feet) and (ii) a second stand-alone building where our limited partnership owned restaurant located at 12790 SW 88th Street, Miami, Florida, (Store #70), operates.\n(7) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2014, we closed on the purchase of the building in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which is leased to our franchisee owned restaurant located at 1479 E. Commercial Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, (Store #15).\n(8) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. We determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt as separate buildings. As a result, the package liquor store has been closed since our first quarter year 2019, but re-opened for business subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2022 in a newly constructed stand-alone building.\n(9) During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. We determined that Store #19 should be demolished and rebuilt as separate buildings. During our first quarter year 2023 we opened our company owned newly built stand-alone package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) for business. During our fiscal year 2023, we also continued constructing a stand-alone building on the same site in Hollywood, Florida adjacent to Store #19P, replacing our restaurant destroyed by fire which previously operated at that site (Store #19R). We anticipate that the restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) will open for business in March 2024.\n(10) During the second quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location, which lease was subsequently assigned to a limited partnership. We raised funds to renovate this new location for operation as a Flanigans restaurant using our limited partnership ownership model. This restaurant opened for business in March 2022.\n(11) During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location, which lease was subsequently assigned to a limited partnership. We raised funds to renovate this new location for operation as a Flanigans restaurant using our limited partnership ownership model, which location opened for business in April 2023.\n(12) During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into a lease for this location. This new location opened for business as a Big Daddys Wine & Liquors retail package liquor store in March 2023.\n(13)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we closed on the purchase of a three building shopping center in Hallandale Beach, Florida adjacent to our combination package store and restaurant in Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31), which consists of: (A) one stand-alone building which is leased to two unaffiliated third party retailers; (B) the second stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party retailer; and (C) the third stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party retailer.\nCasualty Loss\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. The package liquor store re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 in a newly constructed stand-alone building. We believe the restaurant will reopen for business in our fiscal year 2024 in a newly constructed stand-alone building where our combination package liquor store and restaurant was previously located.\nPrivate Offerings\nCIC Investors #85, Ltd.

Capital raised from private investors is credited to sale of noncontrolling interests in our Statements of Stockholders Equity.\nUnder ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company, which is the entity issuing financial statements, is required to consolidate CIC Investors #85, Ltd. as we have a controlling interest in CIC Investors #85, Ltd. as general partner, although the Company only has a 7.40% ownership.\nCIC Investor #25, Ltd. (Flanigans, Miramar, Florida)\nOn February 15, 2022, a Florida limited partnership (CIC Investors #25, Ltd.) in which the Company serves as general partner, completed a private placement of 800 Units of limited partnership interests at $5,000 per Unit for gross proceeds of $4,000,000.

The term of the BSP Lease is for fifty (50) years, triple net to the landlord with fixed rent of $78,000 per year, with two (2%) percent annual increases commencing in year five.\nAssets\nBrendans Sports Pub, Pompano Beach, Florida\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and simultaneously with the execution of the BSP Lease, we purchased the assets of the business known as Brendans Sports Pub located at 868 South Federal Highway, Pompano Beach, Florida for a purchase price of $75,000, including but not limited to the furniture, fixtures, equipment and service mark, Brendans Sports Pub, but excluding the 4 COP liquor license used in the operation of the business. We did not assume any obligations of the business.\nWe accounted for the purchase of the assets of the business known as Brendans Sports Pub as a business combination that is insignificant for purposes of all of the disclosures required under ASC 805.\nPurchase of Real Property; 4 COP Liquor License\nEl Portal, Florida (Big Daddys Liquors/Warehouse)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of the real property it owns located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard, El Portal, Florida consisting of approximately 6,000 square feet of commercial space which we sublease and where our Big Daddys Liquors package liquor store and our warehouse (Store #47) operate for $3,200,000. We paid all cash at closing. Despite the purchase of this property, the sublease arrangement remains in place with all investors.\nHallandale Beach, Florida\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of a three building shopping center in Hallandale Beach, Florida, which consists of one stand-alone building which is leased to two unaffiliated third parties (approximately 1,450 square feet); a second stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately 1,500 square feet); and a third stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately 2,500 square feet) for $8,500,000. The rental income generated by these four lease arrangements is not material. The real property is located adjacent to our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, where our combination package store and restaurant (Store #31) operates. We paid all cash at closing and accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition.\nPurchase of 4 COP Liquor License\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we purchased a 4 COP Quota Liquor License for Broward County, Florida from an unrelated third party for $446,000. The liquor license is currently in use in connection with the operation of our new package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24).\nRe-Financing of Existing Mortgages\nRe-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property - Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we requested and received a loan advance of $697,000 from an entity managed by a member of our Board of Directors who is also our Chief Financial Officer, which entity currently holds a first priority mortgage note on our real property and improvements where our restaurant located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida operates (the West Davie Mortgage Note). Including the $697,000 advance, the principal amount outstanding amount owed under the West Davie Mortgage Note as of September 30, 2023 is $1,049,000. The West Davie Mortgage Note accrues interest at 6% annually, (increased from 5% annually), is amortizable over 15 years with monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $9,300 required to be made and a final balloon payment of approximately $487,000 required to be made August 1, 2032.\nRe-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property - Hallandale Beach, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we re-financed our mortgage debt with our non-affiliated third-party lender secured by our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale, Florida where our combination package liquor store and restaurant (Store #31) operates and borrowed an additional $8,012,000 increasing the principal balance owed by us to $8,900,000, (the $8.90M Mortgage). The $8.90M Mortgage bears interest at a variable rate equal to the BSBY Screen Rate - 1 Month plus 1.50%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk, which fixed the interest rate on the $8.90M Mortgage at 4.90% per annum throughout its term. The $8.90M Mortgage is fully amortized over fifteen (15) years, with our monthly payment of principal and interest totaling $33,000.\nSubsequent Events\nPurchase of Leasehold/Sub-leasehold Interests\nIn 1974, we sold the underlying ground lease to the real property located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard, El Portal, Florida to related and unrelated third parties and simultaneously subleased it back. We operate our retail package liquor store (Store #47) and warehouse from this location. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, we re-purchased a 4% interest in the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement from an unrelated third party for $31,000 and currently own 56% of each lease. As a result, we now only pay 44% of the rent due under the sublease agreement.\nInsurance Premiums\nSubsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we bound coverage on the following property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies with premiums totaling approximately $3.932 million, of which property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism insurance includes coverage for our franchises (of approximately $786,000), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements:\n(i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2023, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We discuss such risks, uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under the captions Risk Factors. In addition, the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the 2023 and 2022 Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Information Concerning Industry Segments\nOur business is conducted principally in two segments: the restaurant segment and the package liquor store segment. Financial information broken into these two principal industry segments for the two fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 is set forth in the Consolidated Financial Statements which are attached hereto.\nGeneral\nAs of September 30, 2023, we (i) operated 31 units, consisting of restaurants, sports bar, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchises an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores.\nFranchised Units. In exchange for our providing management and related services to our franchisees and granting them the right to use our service marks \"Flanigan's Seafood Bar and Grill\" and \"Big Daddy's Liquors\", our franchisees (four of which are franchised to members of the family of our Chairman of the Board, officers and/or directors), are required to (i) pay to us a royalty equal to 1% of gross package liquor sales and 3% of gross restaurant sales; and (ii) make advertising expenditures equal to between 1.5% to 3% of all gross sales based upon our actual advertising costs allocated between stores, pro-rata, based upon gross sales.\nAffiliated Limited Partnership Owned Units. We manage and control the operations of the ten restaurants owned by limited partnerships, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant which is managed and controlled by a related franchisee. Accordingly, the results of operations of all limited partnership owned restaurants, except the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are consolidated with our results of operations for accounting purposes. The results of operations of the Fort Lauderdale, Florida restaurant are accounted for by us utilizing the equity method.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nREVENUES (in thousands):\n-----------------------52 Weeks Ended-----------------------\nSeptember 30, 2023 October 1, 2022\nAmount\nAmount\n(In thousands)\nPercent (In thousands) Percent\nRestaurant food sales $ 107,238 62.56 $ 97,429 62.73\nRestaurant bar sales 29,000 16.92 26,198 16.87\nPackage store sales 35,187 20.52 31,692 20.40\nTotal Sales $ 171,425 100.00 $ 155,319 100.00\nFranchise related revenues 1,857\n1,826\nRental income\nOther operating income\nTotal Revenue $ 174,396\n$ 158,132\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023 and October 1,\nRevenues. Total revenue for our fiscal year 2023 increased $16,264,000 or 10.29% to $174,396,000 from $158,132,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to increased package liquor store and restaurant sales, increased menu prices, revenue generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022, the opening of the package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022, the opening of the package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023 and the comparatively less adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations for our current fiscal year. Additionally, effective March 26, 2023 we increased menu prices for our food offerings to target an increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06% and effective March 19, 2023 we increased menu prices for our bar offerings to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65% annually, to offset higher food costs and higher overall expenses (collectively the Recent Price Increases). Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022. We note that the Recent Price Increases also contributed to our increased revenues\nRestaurant Food Sales. Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of food, including non-alcoholic beverages, at restaurants totaled $107,238,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $97,429,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant food sales for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to restaurant food sales during our fiscal year 2022 is attributable to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant food sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendans Sports Pub, (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida location (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was $1,734,000 and $1,798,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 3.56%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for Company owned restaurants only was $835,000 and $886,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 5.76%. Comparable weekly restaurant food sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only, (excluding Store #25 which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and Store #85 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022), was $898,000 and $912,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, a decrease of 1.54%. We expect that restaurant food sales, including non-alcoholic beverages, for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic, Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024.\nRestaurant Bar Sales. Restaurant revenue generated from the sale of alcoholic beverages at restaurants totaled $29,000,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $26,198,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in restaurant bar sales during our fiscal year 2023 is primarily due to the Recent Price Increases, restaurant bar sales generated from the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) in April 2023, and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) and the operation of Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the comparatively greater adverse effects of COVID-19 on our operations during the our fiscal year 2022 as compared with our fiscal year 2023. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales (for restaurants open for all of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, which consists of nine restaurants owned by us and nine restaurants owned by affiliated limited partnerships, (excluding our Miramar, Florida location (Store #25), Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30), and Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), which opened for business during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, respectively) was $481,000 for our fiscal year 2023 and $487,000 for our fiscal year 2022, a decrease of 1.23%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for Company owned restaurants only was $196,000 and $211,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively, a decrease of 7.11%. Comparable weekly restaurant bar sales for affiliated limited partnership owned restaurants only was $286,000 and $276,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, an increase of 3.62%. We expect that restaurant bar sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased restaurant traffic, Store #25 being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024.\nPackage Liquor Store Sales. Revenue generated from sales of liquor and related items at package liquor stores totaled $35,187,000 for our fiscal year 2023 as compared to $31,692,000 for our fiscal year 2022, an increase of $3,495,000. This increase was primarily due to increased package liquor store traffic due to what appears to be continued increased demand for package liquor store products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and package liquor sales generated from the opening of our package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) in December 2022 and the opening of our package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) in March, 2023. The weekly average of same store package liquor store sales, which includes nine (9) Company-owned package liquor stores, (excluding Store #19P, which was closed for our fiscal year 2022 due to a fire on October 2, 2018 but re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and excluding Store #24 which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023), was $631,000 and $609,000 for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 respectively, an increase of 3.61%. We expect that package liquor store sales for our fiscal year 2024 will increase due to increased package liquor store traffic and the operation of the package liquor stores located at 7990 Davie Road Extension, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) which opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 and located at 11225 Miramar Parkway #245, Miramar, Florida (Store #24), which opened for business during the second quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the entire fiscal year.\nOperating Costs and Expenses. Operating costs and expenses, (consisting of cost of merchandise sold, payroll and related costs, occupancy costs and selling, general and administrative expenses), for our fiscal year 2023 increased $16,169,000 or 10.69% to $167,372,000 from $151,203,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase was primarily due to increased payroll, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process and an expected general increase in food costs, costs and expenses incurred from the opening of the package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar, Florida (Store #24), during our fiscal year 2023, the opening of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) during our fiscal year 2023, and the operation of our Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) and limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85) for our entire fiscal year 2023 but only a part of our fiscal year 2022, partially offset by actions taken by management to reduce and/or control costs. We anticipate that our operating costs and expenses will increase through our fiscal year 2024 primarily due to our package liquor stores in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P) and Miramar, Florida (Store #24) being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024, our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25) being open for business for our entire fiscal year 2024 and the opening of our reconstructed restaurant in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) for business during our fiscal year 2024. Operating costs and expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue to approximately 95.97% in our fiscal year 2023 from 95.62% in fiscal year 2022.\nGross Profit. Gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of merchandise sold from sales.\nRestaurant Food and Bar Sales. Gross profit for food and bar sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to $90,750,000 from $79,072,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of restaurant food and bar sales), was 66.61% for our fiscal year 2023 and 63.96% for our fiscal year 2022. Gross profit margin for restaurant food and bar sales increased during our fiscal year 2023 when compared to our fiscal year 2022 due to decreases in our cost of ribs and the Recent Price Increases, partially offset by among other things, higher food costs.\nPackage Store Sales. Gross profit for package store sales for our fiscal year 2023 increased to $9,377,000 from $8,382,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Our gross profit margin, (calculated as gross profit reflected as a percentage of package liquor store sales), for package store sales was 26.65% for our fiscal year 2023 and 26.45% for our fiscal year 2022. We anticipate that the gross profit margin for package liquor store merchandise will remain stable during our fiscal year 2024.\nPayroll and Related Costs. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 increased $6,871,000 or 13.81% to $56,607,000 from $49,736,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Payroll and related costs for our fiscal year 2023 were higher due primarily to the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Sunrise, Florida (Store #85), and Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and the operation of our limited partnership owned restaurant in Miramar, Florida (Store #25), the retail package liquor store in Hollywood, Florida (Store #19P), and the retail package liquor store in Miramar, Florida (Store #24) for a part of our fiscal year 2023 only and higher salaries to employees to remain competitive with other potential employees in a tight labor market. Payroll and related costs as a percentage of total revenue was 32.46% for our fiscal year 2023 and 31.45% of total revenue for our fiscal year 2022.\nOccupancy Costs. Occupancy costs (consisting of percentage rent, common area maintenance, repairs, real property taxes, amortization of leasehold purchases and rent expense associated with operating lease liabilities under ASC 842) for our fiscal year 2023 increased $535,000 or 7.61% to $7,566,000 from $7,031,000 for our fiscal year 2022. The increase in occupancy costs was primarily due to the payment of rent for our retail package liquor store located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #24), our restaurant location located at 11225 Miramar Parkway, #250, Miramar, Florida (Store #25) and Brendans Sports Pub (Store #30) during our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (consisting of general corporate expenses, including but not limited to advertising, insurance, professional costs, clerical and administrative overhead) for our fiscal year 2023 increased $5,330,000 or 18.29% to $31,901,000 from $26,571,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to Store #85 and Store #30 being open for our entire fiscal year 2023 as opposed to a part of our fiscal year 2022 and Store #19P, Store #24and Store #25 being open during a part of our fiscal year 2023 only, increased consultant fees to improve our accounting process, inflation and otherwise to increases in expenses across all categories. We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue will increase during our fiscal year 2024 due primarily to increases across all categories. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of total revenue in our fiscal year 2023 to 18.29% as compared to 16.80% in our fiscal year 2022.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for our fiscal year 2023, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, increased $572,000 or 18.99% to $3,584,000 from $3,012,000 from our fiscal year 2022. This increase is driven by the opening of Stores #19P, #24, and #25. As a percentage of total revenue, depreciation and amortization expense was 2.06% of revenue for our fiscal year 2023 and 1.90% of revenue for our fiscal year 2022.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, for our fiscal year 2023 increased $310,000 to $1,067,000 from $757,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Interest expense, net, increased for our fiscal year 2023 due to the interest on our borrowing of $8,900,000 from an unrelated third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida (Store #31) and due to interest on our borrowing of $1,100,000 from a related third party lender to re-finance the mortgage loan on our property located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida (Store #22) during our fiscal year 2022.\nIncome Taxes. Income tax for our fiscal year 2023 was an expense of $649,000, as compared to an expense of $763,000 for our fiscal year 2022. Income taxes as a percentage of income before provision for income taxes increased for our fiscal year 2023 (10.70%) as compared to our fiscal year 2022 (7.78%).\nNet Income. Net income for our fiscal year 2023 decreased $3,633,000 or 40.15% to $5,416,000 from $9,049,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to the higher income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during our fiscal year 2023, partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income for our fiscal year 2023 is 3.11%, as compared to 5.72% for our fiscal year 2022.\nNet Income Attributable to Flanigans Enterprise, Inc. Stockholders. Net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 decreased $2,313,000 or 36.64% to $3,999,000 from $6,312,000 for our fiscal year 2022 due primarily to the higher income attributable to the forgiveness of debt of certain of our PPP Loans during our fiscal year 2022, higher food costs and overall increased expenses during our fiscal year 2023, and a higher portion of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests (specifically the operations of our Miramar location), partially offset by increased revenue at our retail package liquor stores and restaurants during our fiscal year 2023 and the Recent Price Increases. As a percentage of revenue, net income attributable to stockholders for our fiscal year 2023 is 2.29%, as compared to 3.99% for our fiscal year 2022.\nNew Limited Partnership Restaurants\nAs new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to advance pre-opening costs, including but not limited to pre-opening rent for the new locations. During our fiscal year 2023, we opened one new restaurant location in Miramar, Florida as a Flanigans.\nMenu Price Increases and Trends\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, we increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective March 26, 2023) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately 2.06% annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective March 20, 2023) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 5.65% annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. During the fiscal year 2022, we increased menu prices for our food offerings (effective October 3, 2021 and December 19, 2021, respectively) to target an aggregate increase to our food revenues of approximately 8.83% annually and we increased menu prices for our bar offerings (effective December 12, 2021) to target an increase to our bar revenues of approximately 7.80% annually to offset higher food and liquor costs and higher overall expenses. Prior to these increases, we previously raised menu prices in the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021.\nCOVID-19 has and will continue to materially and adversely affect our restaurant business for what may be a prolonged period of time. This damage and disruption has resulted from events and factors that were impossible for us to predict and are beyond our control. As a result, COVID-19 has materially adversely affected our results of operations for the fiscal year 2023 and will, in all likelihood, impact our results of operations, liquidity, and/or financial condition throughout our fiscal year 2024. The extent to which our restaurant business may be adversely impacted and its effect on our operations, liquidity and/or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted.\nBased on current COVID-19 trends, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe fund our operations through cash from operations and borrowings from third parties. As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $25,532,000, a decrease of $16,606,000 from our cash balance of $42,138,000 as of October 1, 2022. This decrease is primarily due to our decision not to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022 ($3,281,000), the purchase of properties at Hallandale Beach, Florida ($8,500,000), and El Portal, Florida ($3,200,000), and the continued construction of Store #19R ($1,308,000).\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the LPs), as well as the store we manage but do not own (the Managed Store) (collectively, the Borrowers), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender (the Lender) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP) under the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.98 million (the 2nd PPP Loans), of which approximately: (i) $3.46 million was loaned to six (6) of the LPs; and (ii) $0.52 million was loaned to the Managed Store. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we applied for forgiveness for all PPP Loans, including the Managed Store, and as of September 30, 2023, the entire amount of principal and accrued interest was forgiven under the 2nd PPP Loans.\nInflation is affecting all aspects of our operations, including but not limited to food, beverage, fuel and labor costs. Supply chain issues also contribute to inflation. Inflation, including supply chain issues are having a material impact on our operating results.\nNotwithstanding the negative effects of COVID-19 on our operations, we believe that our current cash availability from our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months.\nCASH FLOWS\nThe following table is a summary of our cash flows for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\n---------Fiscal Years--------\n(in thousands)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 8,489 $ 10,502\nNet cash used in investing activities (18,559 ) (9,542 )\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities (6,536 ) 8,502\nNet (Decrease) Increase in Cash and Cash Equivalents (16,606 ) 9,462\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Beginning 42,138 32,676\nCash and Cash Equivalents, Ending $ 25,532 $ 42,138\nCapital Expenditures\nIn addition to using cash for our operating expenses, we use cash generated from operations and borrowings to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and to fund capitalized property improvements for our existing restaurants. During the fiscal year 2023, we acquired property and equipment and construction in progress of $20,574,000, (including non-cash items which include $2,390,000 of purchase deposits transferred to property and equipment and $545,000 of purchase deposits transferred to construction in progress and $931,000 of construction in progress in accounts payable) including $367,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership owned restaurants and $378,000 for renovations to three (3) Company owned restaurants. During our fiscal year 2022, we acquired property and equipment of $12,655,000 (of which $3,849,000 was for construction in progress; $3,258,000 construction in progress transferred to property and equipment; $969,000 construction in progress in accounts payable; $50,000 was deposits recorded in other assets; and $512,000 was deposits transferred to construction in progress as of October 2, 2021), which amount included $937,000 for renovations to three (3) existing limited partnership restaurants and $159,000 for renovations to two (2) Company-owned restaurants.\nDebt\nAs of September 30, 2023, we had long term debt (including the current portion) of $23,128,000, as compared to $25,389,000 as of October 1, 2022. Our long-term debt decreased as of September 30, 2023 as compared to October 1, 2022 because we satisfied the principal balance and all accrued interest ($367,000) due on our $5.5 million term loan. In addition, we did not finance our insurance premiums for our annual insurance renewal effective December 30, 2022.\nIn February 2023, we determined that as of December 31, 2022, we did not meet the required Post-Distribution Basic Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant) contained in each of our six (6) loans (the Institutional Loans) with our unrelated third-party institutional lender (the Institutional Lender). On February 23, 2023, we received from the Institutional Lender, a written waiver of the non-compliance with the Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant (the Covenant Non-Compliance), pursuant to which, among other things, the Institutional Lender waived (1) the non-compliance as of December 31, 2022 and (2) their right to exercise certain remedies under the Institutional Loans, including the right to accelerate the indebtedness owed by us thereunder, resulting in the indebtedness under the Institutional Loans to be immediately due and payable, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Post-Distribution/Fixed Charge Covenant requires we maintain a ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 and for the twelve (12) months ended September 30, 2023 our ratio was calculated to be 1.40 to 1.00. We have prepared projections going forward and expect to be in compliance. As a result, our classification of debt is appropriate as of September 30, 2023.\nWe repaid long term debt, including auto loans, financial insurance premiums, and mortgages in the amount of $2,299,000 and $3,736,000 in our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(a) Advance on Existing Mortgage Loan - Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we requested and received a loan advance of $697,000 from an entity controlled by a member of our Board of Directors, which entity currently holds a first priority mortgage note on our real property and improvements where our restaurant located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida operates (the West Davie Mortgage Note). Including the $697,000 advance, the principal amount outstanding amount owed under the West Davie Mortgage Note as of September 30, 2023 is $1,049,000. The West Davie Mortgage Note accrues interest at 6% annually, (increased from 5% annually), is amortizable over 15 years with monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $9,300 required to be made and a final balloon payment of approximately $487,000 required to be made August 1, 2032.\n(b) Re-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property - Hallandale Beach, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we re-financed our mortgage debt with our non-affiliated third-party lender secured by our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale, Florida where our combination package liquor store and restaurant (Store #31) operates and borrowed an additional $8,012,000 raising the principal balance to $8,900,000, (the $8.90M Mortgage). The $8.90M Mortgage bears interest at a variable rate equal to the BSBY Screen Rate - 1 Month plus 1.50%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk, which fixed the interest rate on the $8.90M Mortgage at 4.90% per annum throughout its term. The $8.90M Mortgage is fully amortized over fifteen (15) years, with our monthly payment of principal and interest totaling $33,000.\n(c) Financed Insurance Premiums\nPrior to fiscal year 2023, we financed our annual insurance premiums. Due to higher interest rates, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2022, we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist policies, totaling approximately $3.281 million, in full, which includes coverage for our franchisees (which is $658,000), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to continuing higher interest rates for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we will pay the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies in full ($3.932 million), which includes coverage for our franchises (approximately $786,000).\nWe paid the $3.281 million annual premium amounts on January 9, 2023, which includes coverage for our franchisees which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We secured property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2023. (See Item 2. Subsequent Events for a discussion of property insurance for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page 31.)\nConstruction Contracts\n(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19 - Flanigans)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), which has been closed since October 2, 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant at this location totaling $2,515,000 and during our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders increasing the total contract price by $1,021,000 to $3,536,000, of which $1,534,000 has been paid through September 30, 2023 and $1,090,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023.\n(b) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85- \"Flanigan's')\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for exterior renovations at this location totaling $343,000 and through the end of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract price by $327,000 to $670,000, of which the full amount has been paid as of the end of our fiscal year 2023.\nPurchase Commitments/Supply\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $7.0 million of 2.25 & Down Baby Back Ribs (industry jargon for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar year 2023, at a prescribed cost, which we believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024 compared to calendar year 2023 is due to the increase in volume of our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year and Store #19, Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price.\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.\nFlanigans Fish Company, LLC\nAs of September 30, 2023, Flanigans Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (FFC) supplies certain of the fish to all of our restaurants. Since we hold the controlling interest of FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49% of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as a noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\nPurchase of Limited Partnership Interests\nDuring our fiscal year 2023, we did not purchase any limited partnership interests. During our fiscal year 2022 we purchased 74 limited partnership units (7.4% limited partnership interest) in CIC Investors #85, Ltd. (Store #85).\nWorking Capital\nThe table below summarizes the current assets, current liabilities, and working capital as of the end of our fiscal years 2023 and 2022.\nItem Sep 30, 2023 Oct. 1, 2022\n(in Thousands)\nCurrent Assets $ 35,294 $ 50,893\nCurrent Liabilities 22,371 22,176\nWorking Capital $ 12,923 $ 28,717\nOur working capital decreased as of September 30, 2023 from our working capital as of October 1, 2022 primarily due to increases in (i) cash purchases of real property; (ii) cash purchases of property and equipment; and (iii) deposits on property and equipment. Current assets as of October 1, 2022 increased due to our increased borrowings resulting from the Hallandale Mortgage Debt and the West Davie Mortgage Debt, significant portions of which we classified as long term liabilities as of September 30, 2023. Current assets as of September 30, 2023 decreased due to our decision not to finance our insurance premiums for the annual period beginning December 30, 2022, as well as the current year investments in the purchase of property.\nWhile there can be no assurance due to, among other things, unanticipated expenses or unanticipated decline in revenues, or both, we believe that our cash on hand, positive cash flow from operations and borrowed funds will adequately fund operations, debt reductions and planned capital expenditures throughout our fiscal year 2024.\nDuring our fiscal year 2024, we plan to use certain funds on-hand, borrowed funds, and/or insurance proceeds to complete the construction of our new building on the real property we own located at 2505 N. University Drive Hollywood, Florida (Store #19R) where we plan to operate our Flanigans restaurant. There can be no assurance as to the timing for us to complete the construction of the restaurant for Store #19R.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have off-balance sheet arrangements.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted\nThere are no accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted.\nIssued\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This accounting standards update provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. LIBOR rates were published until June 30, 2023. All principal and interest of the Term Loan was paid during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, so the discontinuance of LIBOR rates will have no impact on us.\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance would be effective for the Company in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2024; however, after performing a thorough analysis the Company concluded there is no material impact.\nThere are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe will have a material effect on our financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies are subject to estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nEstimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment\nThe estimates of useful lives for property and equipment are significant estimates. Expenditures for the leasehold improvements and equipment when a restaurant is first constructed are material. In addition, periodic refurbishing takes place and those expenditures can be material. We estimate the useful life of those assets by considering, among other things, expected use, life of the lease on the building, and warranty period, if applicable. The assets are then depreciated using a straight-line method over those estimated lives. These estimated lives are reviewed periodically and adjusted if necessary. Any necessary adjustment to depreciation expense is made in the income statement of the period in which the adjustment is determined to be necessary.\nConsolidation of Limited Partnerships\nAs of September 30, 2023, we operate ten (10) restaurants as general partner of the limited partnerships that own the operations of these restaurants. We expect that any expansion which takes place in opening new restaurants will also result in us operating the restaurants as general partner. In addition to the general partnership interest we also purchased limited partnership units ranging from 0% to 49% of the total units outstanding. As a result of these controlling interests, we consolidate the operations of these limited partnerships with ours despite the fact that we do not own in excess of 50% of the equity interests. All intercompany transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The non-controlling interests in the earnings of these limited partnerships are removed from net income and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires among other things, recognition of future tax benefits measured at enacted rates attributable to deductible temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities and tax credits to the extent that realization of said tax benefits is more likely than not. For discussion regarding our carryforwards refer to Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year 2023.\nLeases\nEffective September 29, 2019, we adopted Accounting Standards Codification Topic 842, Leases (ASC 842), which requires that lease arrangements be presented on the lessees balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability equal to the present value of the related future minimum lease payments. We adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, using the modified retrospective approach. This standard had a material impact on our Consolidated Statements of Income due to the escalations of rent in the extensions but did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Estimates associated with leases include lease classification, discount rate and lease term.\nLoyalty Programs\nWe offer loyalty programs to customers of our restaurants and package liquor stores. The gift cards distributed as a part of our loyalty programs have expiration dates and we estimate breakage for such gift cards.\nOther Matters\nImpact of Inflation\nThe primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food, beverage and labor costs. A large number of restaurant personnel are paid at rates based upon applicable minimum wage and increases in minimum wage directly affect labor costs. Inflation is having a material impact on our operating results, especially rising food, fuel and labor costs. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nAs part of our ongoing operations, we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings. As more fully described in Note 15 Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are on pages through. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of September 30, 2023, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2023.\nMaterial Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our interim or annual financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nDuring the course of our independent registered public accounting firm performing its quarterly review procedures in connection with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to be included in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of our 2023 fiscal year, we became aware of certain errors made by management in recording certain transactions and in performing debt covenant calculations. As a result of these errors we concluded that we did not have a sufficient complement of trained and knowledgeable accounting personnel to prevent and detect errors on a timely basis and that this deficiency constitutes a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nDuring our fiscal year 2023, we began the process of addressing this material weakness by engaging qualified accounting consultants who have been brought on to enhance, and continue to enhance, our internal controls over financial reporting. These individuals are licensed CPAs with appropriate levels of knowledge and experience in public accounting. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, the Company has begun to staff the newly formed Financial Reporting Division of our Accounting Department. This Department is headed by a Financial Reporting Manager who reports directly to the CFO. This individual is a qualified CPA with experience in financial reporting and the restaurant industry. The Company also hired a Senior Accountant to report under this Financial Reporting Manager and has been enlisted with the preparation of various schedules and entries. We will continue our efforts in our fiscal year 2024 of improving our accounting and finance related processes.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nDuring the period covered by this report, we have not made any change to our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Assessment on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. This evaluation was based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013 (COSO). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Permitted Omission from Managements Assessment\nOur internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls can only provide reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only managements report in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there are no critical audit matters.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1999.\nFort Lauderdale, FL\nDecember 29, 2023\nFlanigans Enterprises, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND OCTOBER 1, 2022\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 25,532 $ 42,138\nPrepaid income taxes\nOther receivables\nInventories 7,198 6,489\nPrepaid expenses 1,511 1,575\nTotal current assets 35,294 50,893\nProperty and equipment, net 74,724 55,747\nConstruction in Progress 5,416 7,517\n80,140 63,264\nRight-of-use assets, operating leases 26,987 29,517\nInvestment in Limited Partnerships\nOther Assets:\nLiquor licenses 1,268 1,268\nDeposits on property and equipment 1,860\nLeasehold interests, net\nOther\nTotal other assets 3,096 3,524\nTotal assets $ 145,769 $ 147,492\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\nFlanigans Enterprises, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSEPTEMBER 30, 2023 AND OCTOBER 1, 2022\n(in thousands, except share and per share amounts)\n(Continued)\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses $ 9,271 $ 8,111\nAccrued compensation 1,808 2,104\nDue to franchisees 4,977 4,780\nCurrent portion of long term debt 1,295 2,299\nOperating lease liabilities, current 2,385 2,253\nDeferred revenue 2,635 2,629\nTotal current liabilities 22,371 22,176\nLong Term Debt, Net of Current Portion 21,833 23,090\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current 25,850 28,281\nDeferred tax liabilities\nTotal liabilities 70,855 74,152\nCommitments and Contingencies\nStockholders Equity:\nFlanigans Enterprises, Inc.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOrganization and Capitalization\nThe Company was incorporated in 1959 and operates in South Florida as a chain of full-service restaurants and package liquor stores. Restaurant food and beverage sales make up the majority of our total revenue. As of September 30, 2023, we (i) operated 31 units consisting of restaurants, package liquor stores and combination restaurants/package liquor stores that we either own or have operational control over and partial ownership in; and (ii) franchise an additional five units, consisting of two restaurants, (one of which we operate) and three combination restaurants/package liquor stores. With the exception of one restaurant we operate under the name The Whales Rib, a restaurant in which we do not have an ownership interest, and Brendans Sports Pub, a restaurant/bar we own, all of the restaurants operate under our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans and all of the package liquor stores operate under our service marks Big Daddys Liquors or Big Daddys Wine & Liquors.\nThe Companys Articles of Incorporation, as amended, authorize us to issue and have outstanding at any one time 5,000,000 shares of common stock at a par value of $0.10 per share.\nWe operate under a 52-53 week year ending the Saturday closest to September 30. Our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 are each comprised of a 52-week period.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and our subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned, and the accounts of the ten limited partnerships in which we act as general partner and have controlling interests. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNoncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries are included in the consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of equity. We report consolidated net income inclusive of both the Companys and the noncontrolling interests share, as well as amounts of consolidated net income (loss) attributable to each of the Company and the noncontrolling interests.\nWe use the consolidation method of accounting when we have a controlling interest in other companies and limited partnerships. We use the equity method of accounting when we have significant influence and an interest between twenty to fifty percent in other companies and limited partnerships, but do not exercise control. Under the equity method, our original investments are recorded at cost and are adjusted for our share of undistributed earnings or losses. All intercompany profits are eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements and related disclosures are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenue and expenses during the periods reported. These estimates include assessing the estimated useful lives of tangible assets, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and estimates relating to the calculation of incremental borrowing rates and length of leases associated with right-of-use assets and corresponding liabilities, and estimates relating to loyalty reward programs. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in our consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase and receivables from our credit card merchants to be cash equivalents.\nWe maintain deposit balances with financial institutions, which balances may from time to time, exceed the federally insured limits which are $250,000 for interest and non-interest bearing accounts. We have not experienced any losses on such accounts.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nInventories\nOur inventories, which consist primarily of package liquor products, are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nLiquor Licenses\nIn accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, our liquor licenses are indefinite lived assets, which are not being amortized, but are tested annually for impairment (see Note 11).\nProperty and Equipment\nOur property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. We capitalize expenditures for major improvements and depreciation commences when the assets are placed in service. We record depreciation on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets. We charge maintenance and repairs, which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets, to expense as incurred. When we dispose of assets, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is included in income.\nOur estimated useful lives range from three to five years for vehicles and three to seven years for furniture and equipment. Leasehold improvements are currently being amortized over the shorter of the life of the lease or the life of the asset up to a maximum of 15 years. Our buildings of our corporate offices in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our construction office/warehouse in Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our combination restaurant and package liquor stores in Hallandale, Florida and North Lauderdale, Florida; our restaurants in N. Miami and Fort Lauderdale, Florida; our property in Sunrise, Florida which we lease to a limited partnership (Store #85), our property in Fort Lauderdale, Florida which we lease to a franchisee (Store #15), our package stores in N. Miami, Florida and El Portal, Florida and our shopping centers in Miami, Florida and Hallandale Beach, Florida all of which we own, are being depreciated over forty years. Building improvements are being depreciated over 20 years.\nLeasehold Interests\nOur purchase of an existing restaurant location usually includes a lease to the business premises. As a result, a portion of the purchase price is allocated to the leasehold interest. We capitalize the cost of the leasehold interest and amortization commences upon our assumption of the lease. We amortize leasehold interests on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the lease.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are cash and cash equivalents.\nMajor Suppliers\nThroughout our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we purchased a significant portion of our food products from one major supplier. This major supplier represents 42% and 42% of our cost of goods sold and 29% and 22% of our accounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. We believe that several other alternative vendors are available, if necessary.\nThroughout our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we purchased the majority of our alcoholic beverages from three local distributors. One of these three local distributors represents 24% and 23% of our cost of goods sold for the years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively and 5% and 2% of our accounts payable and accrued expenses as of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, respectively. Each distributor has exclusive rights from the manufacturers to sell specific brands in given areas, so unless the exclusive distribution rights are transferred to another vendor, there are no alternate distributors available.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue-related to food, bar and package sales are recorded at the point of sale. Royalty-related revenues, which are 1% of package sales and 3% of restaurant sales, are recorded as income on a weekly basis, in arrears. We report our revenues net of sales tax.\nOur Big Daddys Good Customer Loyalty Program awards customers with a $20 Good Customer Gift Card, (Gift Card) to be used at our Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill restaurants for every ten (10) purchases of at least $25 made by such customer at our Big Daddys Liquors package liquor stores. Pursuant to ASC 606, we recognize deferred revenue in the amount of the Gift Card upon the issuance of the Gift Card and reduce package liquor store revenue by a like amount. We recognize revenue when the Gift Card is redeemed in our restaurants or when it expires unused. Gift cards have various expiration dates based upon each program, while gift cards purchased for cash have no expiration dates.\nPre-opening Costs\nAs new restaurants open, our income from operations will be adversely affected due to our obligation to fund pre-opening costs. Pre-opening costs are those typically associated with the opening of a new restaurant and generally include payroll costs associated with the new restaurant opening, rent and promotional costs. We expense pre-opening costs as incurred and during our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 we expensed $188,000 for CIC Investors #25. During our fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 we expensed $65,000 for CIC Investors #25, Ltd, and $388,000 for CIC Investors #85, Ltd.\nAdvertising Costs\nOur advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs incurred during our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022 were approximately $253,000 and $209,000, respectively.\nGeneral Liability Insurance\nWe have general liability insurance which incorporates a deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships. During the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we converted the deductible of $10,000 per occurrence for both us and the limited partnerships to $10,000 self-insured retention per occurrence. Our insurance carrier is responsible for $1,000,000 coverage per occurrence above our deductible, up to a maximum aggregate of $2,000,000 per year. During our fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we were able to purchase excess liability insurance, whereby our excess insurance carrier is responsible for $10,000,000 coverage above our primary general liability insurance coverage. We are un-insured against liability claims in excess of $11,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate.\nOur general policy is to settle only those legitimate and reasonable claims asserted and to aggressively defend and go to trial, if necessary, on frivolous and unreasonable claims. Under our current liability insurance policy, any expense incurred by us in defending a claim, including attorney's fees, are a part of our $10,000 deductible, and/or self-insured retention.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe respective carrying value of certain of our on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair value. These instruments include cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, accounts payables, accrued expenses and debt. We have assumed carrying values to approximate fair values for those financial instruments, which are short-term in nature or are receivable or payable on demand. We estimated the fair value of debt based on current rates offered to us for debt of comparable maturities and similar collateral requirements.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820-10-50-1, we utilized a valuation model to determine the fair value of our swap agreement. As the valuation models for the swap agreement were based upon observable inputs, they are classified as Level 2 (see Note 15).\nDerivative Instruments\nWe account for derivative instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-10-05-4, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities as amended, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and hedging activities. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815-10-05-4, derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value. As of September 30, 2023 the fair value of the swap agreement is now reflected on the balance sheet in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive income. We determined that the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and that changes in fair value will be adjusted quarterly based on the valuation statement (see Note 15).\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for our income taxes using FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nWe follow the provisions regarding Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, which require the recognition of a financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We applied these changes to tax positions for our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022. We had no material unrecognized tax benefits and no adjustments to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows were required. Generally, federal, state and local authorities may examine the Companys tax returns for three years from the date of filing and the current and prior three years remain subject to examination as of September 30, 2023.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated life of our intangible and other long-lived assets or whether the remaining balance of our intangible and other long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. If and when such factors, events or circumstances indicate that intangible or other long-lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment, we will determine the fair value of the asset by making an estimate of expected future cash flows over the remaining lives of the respective assets and compare that fair value with the carrying value of the assets in measuring their recoverability. In determining the expected future cash flows, the assets will be grouped at the lowest level for which there are cash flows, at the individual store level.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe follow FASB ASC Topic 260 - Earnings per Share. This section provides for the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution. Earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares.\nRecently Adopted and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nAdopted\nThere are no accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted.\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)\nRecently Issued\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2022-06 Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedient and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In response to the concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates that are more observable or transaction based and less susceptible to manipulation. This accounting standards update provides companies with optional guidance to ease the potential accounting burden associated with transitioning away from reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. LIBOR rates were published until June 30, 2023. All principal and interest of the Term Loan was paid during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, so the discontinuance of LIBOR rates will have no impact on us.\nThe FASB issued guidance, ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which provides a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. This guidance would be effective for the Company in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2024; however, after performing a thorough analysis the Company concluded that there is no material impact.\nThere are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that we have not yet adopted that we believe may have a material effect on our financial statements.\nNOTE 2.

INVESTMENT IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS\nWe have invested along with others (some of whom are affiliated with our officers and directors) in eleven limited partnerships which currently own and operate eleven South Florida based restaurants under our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans. In addition to being a limited partner in these limited partnerships, we are the sole general partner of ten of these limited partnerships and manage and control the operations of the restaurants except for the restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where we only hold a limited partnership interest.\nGenerally, the terms of the limited partnership agreements provide that until the investors cash investment in a limited partnership (including any cash invested by us) is returned in full, (available cash is distributed to the investors pro-rata based on ownership interest), the limited partnership distributes to the investors annually out of available cash from the operation of the restaurant, as a return of capital, up to 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership, with no management fee paid to us. Any available cash in excess of the 25% of the cash invested in the limited partnership distributed to the investors annually, is paid one-half (\u00bd) to us as a management fee and one-half (\u00bd) to the investors (including us), pro-rata based on the investors investment, as a return of capital. Once all of the investors (including us), have received, in full, amounts equal to their cash invested, an annual management fee becomes payable to us equal to one-half (\u00bd) of cash available to be distributed, with the other one-half (\u00bd) of available cash distributed to the investors (including us), as a profit distribution, pro-rata based on the investors investment.\nAs of September 30, 2023, all limited partnerships, with the exception of the 2022 Sunrise Restaurant, which opened for business in March, 2022 and the 2023 Miramar Restaurant, which opened for business in April 2023, have returned all cash invested and we receive an annual management fee equal to one-half (\u00bd) of the cash available for distribution by the limited partnership. In addition to receipt of distributable amounts from the limited partnerships, we receive a fee equal to 3% of gross sales for use of our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans, which use is authorized while we act as general partner only. This 3% fee is earned when sales are made by the limited partnerships and is paid weekly, in arrears. Whether we will have any additional restaurants under development in the future will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and our ability to raise capital. We anticipate that we will continue to form limited partnerships to raise funds to own and operate restaurants under our service marks Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans using the same or substantially similar financial arrangements.\nBelow is information on the eleven limited partnerships which own and operate Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill or Flanigans restaurants:\nSurfside, Florida\nWe are the sole general partner and a 46% limited partner in this limited partnership which has owned and operated a restaurant in Surfside, Florida under our Flanigans Seafood Bar and Grill service mark since March 6, 1998. 33.3% of the remaining limited partnership interest is owned by persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members.

Capital raised from private investors is credited to sale of noncontrolling interests in our Statements of Stockholders Equity.\nUnder ASC 810, Consolidation, the Company, which is the entity issuing financial statements, is required to consolidate CIC Investors #85, Ltd. as we have a controlling interest in CIC Investors #85, Ltd. as general partner, although the Company only has a 7.40% ownership.\nCIC Investor #25, Ltd.

EXECUTION OF LEASE FOR NEW LOCATION; BUSINESS ACQUISITION OF BRENDANS SPORTS PUB\nLease\nPompano Beach, Florida (Brendans Sports Pub)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into a Lease (the BSP Lease) with a non-affiliated third party from whom we rented approximately 3,556 square feet of commercial space located at 868 South Federal Highway, Pompano Beach, Florida, from where we operate the existing Brendans Sports Pub business (Store #30), the assets of which we simultaneously purchased. The term of the BSP Lease is for fifty (50) years, triple net to the landlord with fixed rent of $78,000 per year, with two (2%) percent annual increases commencing in year five.\nAssets\nBrendans Sports Pub, Pompano Beach, Florida\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2022 and simultaneously with the execution of the BSP Lease, we purchased the assets of the business known as Brendans Sports Pub located at 868 South Federal Highway, Pompano Beach, Florida for a purchase price of $75,000, including but not limited to the furniture, fixtures, equipment and service mark, Brendans Sports Pub, but excluding the 4 COP liquor license used in the operation of the business. We did not assume any obligations of the business.\nWe accounted for the purchase of the assets of the business known as \"Brendan's Sports Pub\" as a business combination that is insignificant for purposes of all of the disclosures required under ASC 805.\nNOTE 7. PURCHASE OF REAL PROPERTY; 4 COP LIQUOR LICENSE\nEl Portal, Florida (Big Daddys Liquors/Warehouse)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of the real property it owns located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard, El Portal, Florida consisting of approximately 6,000 square feet of commercial space which we sublease and where our Big Daddys Liquors package liquor store and our warehouse (Store #47) operate for $3,200,000. We paid all cash at closing. Despite the purchase of this property, the sublease arrangement remains in place with all investors.\nHallandale Beach, Florida\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2023, we closed with a non-affiliated third party on the purchase of a three building shopping center in Hallandale Beach, Florida, which consists of one stand-alone building which is leased to two unaffiliated third parties (approximately 1,450 square feet); a second stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately 1,500 square feet); and a third stand-alone building which is leased to one unaffiliated third party (approximately 2,500 square feet) for $8,500,000. The rental income generated by these four lease arrangements is not material. The real property is located adjacent to our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, where our combination package store and restaurant (Store #31) operates. We paid all cash at closing and accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition.\nPurchase of 4 COP Liquor License\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we purchased a 4 COP quota liquor license for Broward County, Florida from an unrelated third party for $446,000. The liquor license is currently in use in connection with the operation of our package liquor store in Miramar, Florida. The 4 COP quota liquor license for Broward County, Florida which we purchased during the third quarter of our fiscal year 2021 and was inactive, was transferred for use in our operation of Brendans Sports Pub during our fiscal year 2022.\nNOTE 8. RE-FINANCING OF EXISTING MORTGAGES; INSURANCE PREMIUMS\nRe-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property - Fort Lauderdale, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we requested and received a loan advance of $697,000 from an entity managed by a member of our Board of Directors who is also our Chief Financial Officer, which entity currently holds a first priority mortgage note on our real property and improvements where our restaurant located at 2600 West Davie Boulevard, Fort Lauderdale, Florida operates (the West Davie Mortgage Note). Including the $697,000 advance, the principal outstanding amount owed under the West Davie Mortgage Note as of September 30, 2023 is $1,049,000. The West Davie Mortgage Note accrues interest at 6% annually, (increased from 5% annually), is amortizable over 15 years with monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $9,300 required to be made and a final balloon payment of approximately $487,000 required to be made August 1, 2032.\nRe-Finance of Mortgage on Real Property - Hallandale Beach, Florida\nDuring our fiscal year 2022, we re-financed our mortgage debt with a non-affiliated third-party lender secured by our real property located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale, Florida where our combination package liquor store and restaurant (Store #31) operates and borrowed an additional $8,012,000 raising the principal balance to $8,900,000, (the $8.90M Mortgage). The $8.90M Mortgage bears interest at a variable rate equal to the BSBY Screen Rate - 1 Month plus 1.50%. We entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk, which fixed the interest rate on the $8.90M Mortgage at 4.90% per annum throughout its term. The $8.90M Mortgage is fully amortized over fifteen (15) years, with our monthly payment of principal and interest totaling $33,000.\nInsurance Premiums\nPrior to fiscal year 2023, we financed our annual insurance premiums. Due to higher interest rates, during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2022, we paid the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability and terrorist policies, totaling approximately $3.281 million, which includes coverage for our franchisees (which is $658,000), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. Due to continuing higher interest rates for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we will pay the premiums for property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies in full ($3.932 million), which includes coverage for our franchises (approximately $786,000), at the beginning of the second quarter of our fiscal year 2024.\nWe paid the $3.281 million annual premium amounts on January 9, 2023, which includes coverage for our franchisees which are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We secured property insurance for the period commencing after the expiration of the current policy on December 30, 2023. (See Note 20. Subsequent Events for a discussion of insurance premiums for the period commencing December 30, 2023 on page.)\nNOTE 9. CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\nIn March 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus was declared a global pandemic and a National Public Health Emergency. The novel coronavirus pandemic, (COVID-19) adversely affected and will, in all likelihood continue to adversely affect, our restaurant operations and financial results for the foreseeable future. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) permitted the federal Public Health Emergency for COVID-19 (PHE) declared by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary) under Section 319 of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act to expire at the end of the day on May 11, 2023.\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2021, certain of the entities owning the limited partnership stores (the LPs), as well as the store we manage but do not own (the Managed Store), applied for and received loans from an unrelated third party lender pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP) under the United States Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act) enacted March 27, 2020, in the aggregate principal amount of approximately $3.98 million, (the 2nd PPP Loans), of which approximately: (i) $3.46 million was loaned to six of the LPs; and (ii) $0.52 million was loaned to the Managed Store. The 2nd PPP Loan to the Managed Store is not included in our consolidated financial statements. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we applied for and received forgiveness of the entire amount of principal and accrued interest for all 2nd PPP Loans, including the Managed Store.\nCOVID-19 has had a material adverse effect on our access to supplies or labor and there can be no assurance that there will not be a significant adverse impact on our supply chain or access to labor in the future. We are actively monitoring our food suppliers to assess how they are managing their operations to mitigate supply flow and food safety risks. To ensure we mitigate potential supply availability risk, we are building additional inventory back stock levels when appropriate and we have also identified alternative supply sources in key product categories including but not limited to food, sanitation and safety supplies.\nNOTE 10. RE-CONSTRUCTION FOLLOWING CASUALTY LOSS\nDuring the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19) was damaged by a fire and was forced to close. The package liquor store re-opened for business during the first quarter of our fiscal year 2023 in a newly constructed stand-alone building. We believe the restaurant will reopen for business in our fiscal year 2024 in a newly constructed stand-alone building where our combination package liquor store and restaurant was previously located.\nNOTE 11. LIQUOR LICENSES\nLiquor licenses, which are indefinite lived assets, are tested for impairment in September of each of our fiscal years. The fair value of liquor licenses at September 30, 2023, exceeded the carrying amount; therefore, we recognized no impairment loss. The fair value of the liquor licenses was evaluated by comparing the carrying value to recent sales for similar liquor licenses in the County issued. At September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the total carrying amount of our liquor licenses was $1,268,000.\nNOTE 12.

As of September 30, 2023, the net book value of the collateral securing this mortgage was $7,601,000\n1,913\n2,031\nMortgage payable to institutional lender, secured by a first mortgage on real property and improvements, bearing interest at BSBY Screen Rate - 1 Month +1.50%, (5.38% at September 30, 2023), but with the interest fixed at 4.90% pursuant to a swap agreement, amortized over fifteen (15) years, payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $33,000. From the re-financing of this mortgage, we withdrew $8,012,000 during our fiscal year ended October 1, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the net book value of the collateral securing this mortgage was $3,458,000.\n8,505\n8,900\nRevolving credit line/term loan payable to institutional lender, which entitled the Company to borrow, from time to time through December 28, 2017, up to $5,500,000, (the Credit Line), secured by a blanket lien on all Company assets, bearing interest through December 28, 2017 at LIBOR - Daily Floating Rate + 2.25%.

As of September 30, 2023, the net book value of the collateral securing this mortgage was $1,033,000.\nNOTE 13. DEBT (Continued)\nMortgage payable to a related party, an entity the owners of which include persons who are either our officers, directors or their family members, secured by first mortgage on real property and improvements, bearing interest at 6%, amortized over fifteen (15) years, payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately $9,300, with a balloon payment of approximately $487,000 on August 1, 2032.

DEBT (Continued)\nAs of September 30, 2023, we are in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our loans with our unrelated third party institutional lender (the Institutional Lender). We owe in the aggregate, approximately $21,610,000 (the Institutional Loans), as of September 30, 2023.\nThere can be no assurances that we will be in compliance with our financial covenants thereafter due to, among other things, that our results of operations will likely continue to be materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Absent a waiver, failure to be in compliance with our financial covenants would constitute a default under the Institutional Loans with our Institutional Lender when reported. Such a default, if not cured or waived, would allow the Institutional Lender to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness we owe under the Institutional Loans, making it due and payable at the time. If maturity of the Institutional Loans were accelerated, it would have a material adverse impact on our financial position.\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS\nConstruction Contracts\n(a) 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19 - Flanigans)\nDuring the third quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with an unaffiliated third party architect for design and development services totaling $77,000 for the re-build of our restaurant located at 2505 N. University Drive, Hollywood, Florida (Store #19), which has been closed since October 2, 2018 due to damages caused by a fire, of which $62,000 has been paid. During the first quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor to re-build our restaurant at this location totaling $2,515,000 and during our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders increasing the total contract price by $1,021,000 to $3,536,000, of which $1,534,000 has been paid through September 30, 2023 and $1,090,000 has been paid subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023.\n(b) 14301 W. Sunrise Boulevard, Sunrise, Florida (Store #85 - \"Flanigan's)\nDuring the second quarter of our fiscal year 2022, we entered into an agreement with a third party unaffiliated general contractor for exterior renovations at this location totaling $ 343,000 and through the end of our fiscal year 2023 we agreed to change orders to the agreement increasing the total contract price by $327,000 to $670,000, of which the full amount has been paid as of the end of our fiscal year 2023.\nLegal Matters\nOur sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes, which allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person. If we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We currently have no dram shop claims pending.\nWe are a party to various other claims, legal actions and complaints arising in the ordinary course of our business. It is our opinion that all such matters are without merit or involve such amounts that an unfavorable disposition would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nLeases\nTo conduct certain of our operations, we lease restaurant and package liquor store space in South Florida from unrelated third parties. Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to 49 years, some of which include options to renew and extend the lease terms for up to an additional 30 years. We presently intend to renew some of the extension options available to us and for purposes of computing the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities required by ASC 842, we have incorporated into all lease terms which may be extended, an additional term of the lesser of (i) the amount of years the lease may be extended; or (ii) 15 years.\nFollowing adoption of ASC 842 during our fiscal year ended October 3, 2020, common area maintenance and property taxes are not considered to be lease components.\nThe components of lease expense are as follows:\n(in thousands)\n52 Weeks 52 Weeks\nEnded September\n30, 2023 Ended October 1,\nOperating Lease Expense, which is included in occupancy costs $ 3,822 $ 3,725\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:\n(in thousands)\nClassification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets September 30, 2023 October 1, 2022\nAssets\nOperating lease assets $ 26,987 $ 29,517\nLiabilities\nOperating lease current liabilities $ 2,385 $ 2,253\nOperating lease non-current liabilities $ 25,850 $ 28,281\nWeighted Average Remaining Lease Term:\nOperating leases 9.86 Years 10.82 Years\nWeighted Average Discount:\nOperating leases 4.75% 4.66%\nThe following table outlines the minimum future lease payments for the next five years and thereafter:\n(in thousands)\nFor fiscal year Operating\n3,619\n3,606\n3,440\n3,344\n3,309\nThereafter 21,819\nTotal lease payments (undiscounted cash flows) 39,137\nLess imputed interest (10,902 )\nTotal operating lease liabilities $ 28,235\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nPurchase Commitments\nIn order to fix the cost and ensure adequate supply of baby back ribs for our restaurants for calendar years 2023 and 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with our current rib supplier, whereby we agreed to purchase approximately $7.0 million of 2.25 & Down Baby Back Ribs (industry jargon for the weight range in which slabs of baby back ribs are sold) from this vendor during calendar year 2023, at a prescribed cost, which we believe is competitive. The increase in our cost of baby back ribs for calendar year 2024 compared to calendar year 2023 is due to our purchase of ribs for Store #25, Miramar, Florida being open for the entire calendar year and Store #19, Hollywood, Florida anticipated to be open for a part of the calendar year, offset by a decrease in market price.\nWhile we anticipate purchasing all of our rib supply from this vendor, we believe there are several other alternative vendors available, if needed.\nFlanigans Fish Company, LLC\nAs of September 30, 2023, Flanigans Fish Company, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (FFC), supplies certain fish to all of our restaurants. Since we hold the controlling interest in FFC, the balance sheet and operating results of this entity are consolidated into the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company. Sales and purchases of fish are recognized in restaurant food sales and restaurant and lounges (cost of merchandise sold), respectively, in the consolidated statements of income at the time of sale to the restaurant. In addition, the 49% of FFC owned by the unrelated third party is recognized as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements.\nFranchise Program\nAt September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, we were the franchisor of five units under franchise agreements. Of the five franchised stores, three are combination restaurant/package liquor stores and two are restaurants (one of which we operate). Four franchised stores are owned and operated by related parties as follows:\nJames G. Flanigan, our Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and President of the Company, and Michael B. Flanigan, a member of our Board of Directors and James G. Flanigans brother, are each a 35.24% owner of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant and adjacent package liquor store located in Coconut Grove, Florida (Store #18).\nPatrick J. Flanigan, brother to both James G. Flanigan and Michael B. Flanigan and a member of our Board of Directors, owns 100% of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a combination restaurant/package liquor store located in Pompano Beach, Florida (Store #43).\nOur officers and directors collectively own 30% of the shareholder interest of a company which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida. The shareholder interest of James G. Flanigans family represents an additional 60% of the total invested capital in this franchised location (Store #14).\nPatrick J. Flanigan is the sole general partner and a 25% limited partner in a limited partnership which has a franchise arrangement with us for the operation of a restaurant located in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The Company is a 25% limited partner in this limited partnership and officers and directors of the Company (excluding Patrick J. Flanigan) own an additional 31.9% limited partnership interest in this franchised location (Store #15).\nUnder the franchise agreements, we provide guidance, advice and management assistance to the franchisees. In addition and for an additional annual fee of approximately $25,000, we also act as fiscal agent for the franchisees whereby we collect all revenues and pay all expenses and distributions. We also, from time to time, advance funds on behalf of the franchisees for the cost of renovations. The resulting amounts receivable from and payable to these franchisees are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability. We also agree to sponsor and manage cooperative buying groups on behalf of the franchisees for the purchase of inventory. The franchise agreements provide for royalties to us of approximately 3% of gross restaurant sales and 1% of gross package liquor sales. During our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we earned royalties of $1,163,000 and $1,132,000, respectively, from our related franchises, which royalties are included in Franchise-related revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Income. We are not currently offering or accepting new franchises.\nNOTE 14. COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER MATTERS (Continued)\nEmployment Agreements/Bonuses\nAs of September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, we had no employment agreements.\nOur Board of Directors approved an annual performance bonus, with 14.75% of the corporate pre-tax net income, plus or minus non-recurring items, but before depreciation and amortization in excess of $650,000 paid to the Chief Executive Officer and 5.25% paid to other members of management, (the Officers Bonus). Officers Bonuses for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 amounted to approximately $1,604,000 and $2,167,000, respectively.\nOur Board of Directors also approved an additional annual performance bonus, with 5% of the pre-tax net income before depreciation and amortization from our restaurants in excess of $1,875,000 and our share of the pre-tax net income before depreciation and amortization from the restaurants owned by the limited partnerships paid to the Chief Operating Officer and 5% paid to the Chief Financial Officer (the Restaurant Bonus'). Restaurant Bonuses for our fiscal years 2023 and 2022 amounted to approximately $1,090,000 and $1,340,000, respectively.\nManagement Agreements\nDeerfield Beach, Florida\nSince January 2006, we have managed The Whales Rib, a casual dining restaurant located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, pursuant to a management agreement. We paid $500,000 in exchange for our rights to manage this restaurant. The management agreement was amortized and paid on a straight-line basis over the life of the initial term of the agreement, ten (10) years. The restaurant is owned by a third party unaffiliated with us. In exchange for providing management, bookkeeping and related services, we receive one-half (\u00bd) of the net profit, if any, from the operation of the restaurant. During the third quarter of our fiscal year 2011, the term of the management agreement was extended through January 9, 2036. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, we generated $400,000 of revenue from each fiscal year from providing these management services.\nNOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe follow FASB (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement, for financial assets and liabilities and for non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on at least an annual basis. Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of non-performance. Topic 820 establishes a fair market hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Topic 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:\n\u25cf Level 1 Inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\u25cf Level 2 Inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable through correlation with market data. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and inputs to evaluation models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment because the inputs used in the model, such as interest rates and volatility, can be corroborated by readily observable market data.\n\u25cf Level 3 Inputs - One or more significant inputs that are unobservable and supported by little or no market activity, and that reflect the use of significant management judgment. Level 3 assets and liabilities include those whose fair value measurements are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar valuation techniques, and significant management judgment or estimation.\nNOTE 15. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (Continued)\nInterest Rate Swap Agreements\nAt September 30, 2023, we had one variable rate instrument outstanding that is impacted by changes in interest rates. The interest rate of our variable rate debt instrument is equal to the lenders BSBY Screen Rate plus one and one-half percent (1.50%) per annum. In September 2022, we refinanced the mortgage loan encumbering the property where our combination package liquor store and restaurant located at 4 N. Federal Highway, Hallandale Beach, Florida, (Store #31) operates, which mortgage loan is held by an unaffiliated third party lender (the $8.90M Loan).\nAs a means of managing our interest rate risk on this debt instrument, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with our unrelated third-party lender to convert this variable rate debt obligation to a fixed rate. We are currently party to the following interest rate swap agreement:\n(i) The interest rate swap agreement entered into in September 2022 relates to the $8.90M Loan (the $8.90M Term Loan Swap). The $8.90M Term Loan Swap requires us to pay interest for a fifteen (15) year period at a fixed rate of 4.90% on an initial amortizing notional principal amount of $8,900,000, while receiving interest for the same period at BSBY Screen Rate - 1 Month, plus 1.50%, on the same amortizing notional principal amount. As of September 30, 2023 the fair value of the swap agreement is now reflected on the balance sheet in other assets and accumulated other comprehensive income. We determined that the interest rate swap agreement is an effective hedging agreement and that changes in fair value will be adjusted quarterly based on the valuation statement.\nNOTE 16. COMMON STOCK\nTreasury Stock\nPurchase of Common Shares\nDuring our fiscal years 2023 and 2022, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. As of September 30, 2023, we still have authority to purchase 65,414 shares of our common stock under the discretionary plan approved by the Board of Directors on May 17, 2007. Our current repurchase plan has no expiration date and purchases under this program may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions, up to a purchase price of price of $15 per share. The Internal Revenue Service will impose a 1.0% tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022.\nNOTE 17. BUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe operate principally in two reportable segments - package stores and restaurants. This determination was made by the Chief Financial Officer of the Company to align our financial reporting presentation with the major streams of revenue generation. The operation of package stores consists of retail liquor sales and related items. Information concerning the revenues and operating income for our fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022, and identifiable assets for the two reportable segments in which we operate, are shown in the following table.\nOperating income is total revenue less cost of merchandise sold and operating expenses relative to each segment. In computing operating income, none of the following items have been included: interest expense, other non-operating income and expense and income taxes. Identifiable assets by segment are those assets that are used in our operations in each segment. Corporate assets are principally cash and real property, improvements, furniture, equipment and vehicles used at our corporate headquarters. We do not have any operations outside of the United States and transactions between restaurants and package liquor stores are not material.\nNOTE 17.

Employees may contribute elective deferrals to the plan up to amounts allowed under the Internal Revenue Code. We are not required to contribute to the plan but may make discretionary profit sharing and/or matching contributions. During our fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and October 1, 2022, the Board of Directors approved discretionary matching contributions totaling $70,000 and $71,000, respectively.\nNOTE 20. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nPurchase of Leasehold / Sub-leasehold Interests\nIn 1974, we sold the underlying ground lease to the real property located at 8600 Biscayne Boulevard, El Portal, Florida to related and unrelated third parties and simultaneously subleased it back. We operate our retail package liquor store (Store #47) and warehouse from this location. Subsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, we re-purchased a 4% interest in the underlying ground lease, as well as the sublease agreement from an unrelated third party for $31,000 and currently own 56% of each lease. As a result, we now only pay 44% of the rent due under the sublease agreement.\nInsurance Premiums\nSubsequent to the end of our fiscal year 2023, for the policy year commencing December 30, 2023, we bound coverage on the following property, general liability, excess liability, crime and terrorism policies with premiums totaling approximately $3.932 million, of which property, general liability, excess liability and terrorism insurance includes coverage for our franchises (of approximately $786,000), which are not included in our consolidated financial statements:\n(i) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2023, our general liability insurance, excluding limited partnerships, is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers.

The one (1) year general liability insurance premium is in the amount of $455,000;\n(ii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2023, our general liability insurance for our limited partnerships is a one (1) year policy with our insurance carriers. The one (1) year general liability insurance premium is in the amount of $1,055,000;\n(iii) For the policy year beginning December 30, 2023, our automobile insurance is a one (1) year policy.
