    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nOneWater Marine Inc. (OneWater Inc.) is a holding company and the sole managing member of One Water Marine Holdings, LLC (OneWater LLC), which became the principal operating subsidiary of OneWater Inc. on February 11, 2020 in the corporate reorganization (the Reorganization) completed in connection with OneWater Inc.s initial public offering (the IPO), which closed on February 11, 2020.\nExcept as otherwise indicated or required by the context, all references in this Form 10-K to the Company, OneWater, we, us or our relate to (i) for periods after the Reorganization, OneWater Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and (ii) for periods on or prior to the Reorganization, to OneWater LLC, our accounting predecessor, and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe believe that we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States with 98 dealership locations, 11 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces as of September 30, 2023. Our retail locations are located in highly attractive markets throughout the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, many of which are in the top twenty states for marine retail expenditures. We believe that we are a market leader by volume in sales of premium boats in many of the markets in which we operate. Additionally, the recent acquisitions of T-H Marine Supplies, LLC (T-H Marine) and Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. (\"Ocean Bio-Chem\") have significantly expanded our sales of marine-related parts and accessories. The combination of our significant scale, diverse inventory, access to premium boat brands, access to a broad array of parts and accessories, and meaningful group brand equity enables us to provide a consistently professional experience as reflected in the number of our repeat customers and Dealership same-store sales growth.\nEffective August 9, 2022, our reportable segments changed as a result of the Companys acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem, which changed managements reporting structure and operating activities. We now report our operations through two reportable segments: Dealerships and Distribution.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Dealerships segment includes operations of 98 dealerships in 15 states including Florida, Texas, Alabama and Georgia, among others, and represents approximately 91% of revenues for the year ended September 30, 2023. The Dealership segment engages in the sale of new and pre-owned boats, arranges financing and insurance products, performs repairs and maintenance services, offers marine related parts and accessories and offers slip and storage accommodations in certain locations. In fiscal year 2023, we sold over 10,000 new and pre-owned boats, many of which were sold to customers who had a trade-in or with whom we otherwise had established relationships. We offer a wide array of new boats at various price points through relationships with 49 manufacturers covering 70 brands. We believe we are currently a top-three customer for 29 of our 70 brands and the single largest customer for each of our top five highest-selling brands. While we believe our order volume amounts to between 10% to 40% of total sales for those top five brands, no single brand accounts for more than 8% of our total sales volume.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Distribution segment includes the activity of three of our fully-owned businesses, PartsVu, Ocean Bio-Chem and T-H Marine and its subsidiaries, which together operate 11 distribution centers/warehouses in Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma, Indiana, Tennessee and Illinois and represents approximately 9% of revenues. The Distribution segment engages in the manufacturing, assembly and distribution of primarily marine-related products for sale to distributors, big box retailers, online retailers and direct to consumers. We offer a wide array of branded parts and accessories including jack plates, rigging parts, plumbing components, LED lighting, storage systems, and appearance, cleaning, and maintenance products for the marine and ancillary industries. All revenue for the Distribution segment is reported in service, parts & other in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have a diversified revenue profile that is comprised of new boat sales, pre-owned boat sales, finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories. Non-boat sales were approximately 19.5% of revenue and 35.6% of gross profit in fiscal year 2023, 17.8% of revenue and 30.1% of gross profit in fiscal year 2022 and 11.3% of revenue and 25.8% of gross profit in fiscal year 2021. We believe that our diversification of revenue streams, the strength of our industry relationships and our scale enables us to receive among the best pricing and terms available across all of the products that we carry. We routinely evaluate our sales performance and consumer demand to ensure that the economic relationship we have in place with our manufacturers and suppliers optimizes our profitability.\nWe were formed in 2014 as OneWater LLC through the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine, which created a marine retail platform that collectively owned and operated 19 dealerships. Since the combination in 2014, we have acquired a total of 80 additional dealerships, 12 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces through 33 acquisitions. Our current portfolio as of September 30, 2023 consists of multiple brands which are recognized on a local, regional or national basis. Because of this, we believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States based on number of dealerships and total boats sold. While we have opportunistically opened new dealerships in select markets, or launched additional parts and accessory products, we believe that it is generally more effective economically and operationally to acquire existing businesses with experienced staff and established reputations.\nOur Market and Our Customer\nConsumer spending in the United States on boats, engines, services, parts, accessories and related purchases reached $59.3 billion in 2022, up 4.4% from 2021, and has, on average, grown in excess of 6% annually since 2011. New powerboat sales have driven market growth and reached $16.0 billion in 2022, resulting in a 12% average annual growth rate since 2011. Of the approximately 1,016,000 powerboats sold in the United States in 2022, 81% of total units sold (approximately 826,000) were pre-owned. Relative demand for new and late-model boats has increased in recent years in part due to the continuous evolution of boat technology and design including, but not limited to, seating configurations, power, efficiency, instrumentation and electronics, and wakesurf gates, each of which represents a material design improvement that cannot be matched by more dated boat models. We believe the increasing pace of innovation in technology and design will result in more frequent upgrade purchases and ultimately higher sales volumes of new and late-model, pre-owned boat sales. While we continue to monitor the impact of the macro-economic environment, including challenges related to inflation and consumer demand, our financial position through September 30, 2023 suggests that spending in our regions and across product lines has proven resilient as families continue to focus on outdoor recreation, driving increased sales.\nThe boat dealership market is highly fragmented and is comprised of approximately 4,200 dealerships nationwide. Most competing boat retailers are operated by local business owners who own three or fewer stores; however we do have two large competitors - MarineMax and Bass Pro Shops. We believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States. Despite our size, we comprise less than 3% of total industry sales. Our scale and business model allow us to leverage our extensive inventory to provide consumers with the ability to find a boat that matches their preferences (e.g., make, model, color, configuration and other options) and to deliver the boat within days while providing a personalized sales experience. In addition to boat sales, we also generate sales from related products including finance & insurance and service, parts & other sales. The recent acquisitions of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem have significantly expanded our sales of marine parts and accessories. Our strategic growth in this area is also expected to materially expand our addressable market in the parts and accessories business. We are able to operate with a comparatively higher degree of profitability than other independent retailers because we allocate support resources across our broader base, focus on high-margin service parts and accessories, utilize floor plan financing and provide core back-office functions on a scale that many independent retailers are unable to match. We seek to be the leading marine retailer by total market share within each boating market and within the product segments in which we participate. To the extent that we are not, we will evaluate acquiring other local retailers in order to increase our sales, to add additional brands or to provide us with additional high-quality personnel.\nOur inventory and product selection allow us to cater to a highly diverse customer base with price points and boat types that appeal to a broad spectrum of budgets and preferences. The boating industrys and MarineMaxs average selling prices for a new boat were $84,000 in calendar year 2022 and $306,000 in fiscal year 2023, respectively. By comparison, our average selling price for a new boat in fiscal year 2023 was $232,000.\nGrowth Strategy\nOrganic Growth Strategy: Our business model utilizes our unique scale to drive profitable Dealership same-store sales growth. We seek to gain market share by delivering high-quality products and services, with customized attributes tailored to our customers product specifications. Additionally, we are able to leverage our potential customer database to garner new sales. Sales growth from our existing dealerships is a core component of our current and future strategy. We may also develop a greenfield location if an attractive acquisition is not available in a market we choose to target. We believe non-boat sales will be a driver of our organic growth strategy in the future. We have completed acquisitions and implemented a targeted marketing strategy across our platform focused on growing new and existing customer awareness and usage of our finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories products. We intend to expand our online presence and sales through digital platforms to engage in online new and pre-owned boat sales, parts and accessories as well as financing & insurance. We believe this will further advance our long-term growth opportunity, while broadening our customer base and geographic reach.\nAcquisition Strategy: We believe there is a tremendous opportunity for us to expand in both existing and new markets, given that the industry is highly fragmented with most boat retailers owning three or fewer stores. We seek to create value by implementing the best tested operational practices to family-owned and operated businesses that previously lacked the resources, management experience and expertise to maximize the profitability of the acquired standalone businesses. We believe that our dealer group branding strategy, which retains the name, logo and trademarks associated with each dealership or dealer group at the time of acquisition, significantly differentiates us from our largest competitors who employ singular, national branding strategies. In addition, we have and may again acquire businesses that focus on the sales of parts and accessories. We believe there is a significant opportunity for us to expand our presence in this less cyclical and higher margin business. We are committed to maintaining local and regional branding because we believe that the value of retaining the goodwill and long-standing customer relationships of these local businesses, many of which have been built by families over decades, far exceeds the benefits of attempting to establish a potentially unfamiliar OneWater national brand. In addition, preserving this established identity maintains the long-term engagement of former owners because their name and reputation remain figuratively and literally on the door. We believe that the marine industry is underpinned by strong fundamental drivers, and that, with the implementation of operational control measures and the injection of resources, local dealerships can significantly increase revenues and profitability. We believe our status as a consolidator of choice is based on the expertise we have developed through completing 33 acquisitions (80 dealerships, 12 distribution centers/warehouses acquired) since the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine in 2014, our growing cash flow and financial profile, and our footprint of retailers within prime markets. Our ability to acquire additional locations or dealer groups at attractive multiples is further enhanced by our growing reputation for retaining the sellers management team and keeping their branding and legacy intact. Accordingly, the sellers remain actively involved in the business and many have remained employed with us for years beyond the closing of the acquisition. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand our dealership footprint in regions with strong boating cultures. While we have a strong presence in the Southeastern portion of the United States, there are several areas of opportunity in states adjacent to our current geographic footprint as well as states in new regions in the Midwest and Western United States. We continue to strategically evaluate potential acquisitions and as a result of our reputation in the marketplace, we expect our pipeline of potential acquisitions to grow over time.\nIndustry Trends and Market Opportunity\nU.S. Recreational Boating Industry\nRecreational boating is a well-established American pastime that attracts millions of people each year to the water. While Florida is the leading state for new boating sales and registrations due to its abundance of both fresh water and salt water, boating is very popular throughout the United States with Texas, Michigan, North Carolina and Minnesota representing the rest of the top five states for new marine retail expenditures.\nIn 2022, $59.3 billion was spent on retail boating sales, which has contributed to annual growth in excess of 6% percent since 2011. Consumer marine spending includes purchases of new and pre-owned boats; marine products such as engines, trailers, equipment, and accessories; and related expenditures, such as fuel, insurance, docking, storage, and repairs. New boat sales and pre-owned boat sales constituted 37% and 22% of 2022 boating retail sales, respectively, based on industry data from the National Marine Manufacturers Association (NMMA). The NMMA estimates that approximately 998,000 pre-owned boats were sold in 2022. Non-boat sales include aftermarket accessories (21% of total 2022 boating retail sales) and finance & insurance products and ancillary services, such as insurance, maintenance and fuel (20% of total 2022 boating retail sales). The strategic acquisitions we made in our Distribution segment have increased our presence in the significant aftermarket accessories market.\nBoat sales volumes are correlated with consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit. Recent increase in spending has been driven by the rising average selling prices partially offset by a decrease in units sold. Innovation, including updated boat configurations, hull designs, wake gates and other electronics, have contributed to shorter boat upgrade cycles which result in higher unit sales volume prior to the current year decrease. Pre-owned traditional powerboat sales were approximately $12.2 billion in 2022, which represents a decrease of 7.1% compared to 2021. After the significant growth in 2020 and 2021, pre-owned traditional powerboat sales have started to normalize following the COVID-19 pandemic but still remain well in excess of pre-pandemic sales. With the exception of 2020 - 2022, pre-owned traditional powerboat sales have remained relatively consistent seen since 2006 and through economic cycles. The boat dealership market is highly fragmented with approximately 4,200 dealerships nationwide, and the majority of retailers are owner-operated with three stores or fewer. Independent retailers typically offer a limited selection of boat brands, and they predominantly focus on new boat sales with less expertise and capacity to create a meaningful business from non-boat sales such as finance & insurance products.\nProducts and Services\nWe offer new and pre-owned recreational boats, yachts and related marine products, including parts and accessories, with a specific focus on premium brands. We also provide boat repair and maintenance services, arrange boat financing and insurance and offer other ancillary services, including indoor and outdoor storage, marina services, and rentals of boats and personal watercraft.\nNew and Pre-Owned Boat Sales\nOur Dealership segment focuses primarily on the sale of new and pre-owned recreational boats, including saltwater fishing boats, pontoon, runabout, wake/ski boats, and yachts. We offer products from a broad variety of manufacturers and brands without relying on any one manufacturer or brand in particular. No single brand accounted for more than 8% of our total sales volume in fiscal year 2023. We also sell pre-owned versions of the brands we offer and pre-owned boats of other brands we take as trade-ins or acquire. During fiscal year 2023, new boat sales accounted for approximately $1,223.7 million or 63.2% of our consolidated revenue, and pre-owned boat sales accounted for approximately $334.5 million or 17.3% of our consolidated revenue.\nWe offer new and pre-owned recreational boats in a broad range of product categories. We believe that the product lines and brands we offer are among the highest quality within their respective market categories, with well-established brand recognition and reputations for quality, performance, styling and innovation.\nFishing Boats. Revenue from fishing boats comprised 39% of our new boat revenue for fiscal year 2023. The fishing boats we offer range from entry-level models to advanced models, from brands such as Everglades, Grady-White, Pursuit, Sportsman, Cobia and World Cat, each designed for fishing and water sports in lakes, bays and off-shore waters, with cabins with limited live-aboard capability. The fishing boats we offer typically feature livewells, in-deck fishboxes, rodholders, rigging stations, cockpit coaming pads and fresh and saltwater washdowns.\nPontoon Boats and Runabouts. Revenue from pontoon boats and runabouts comprised 30% of our new boat revenue for fiscal year 2023. We offer a variety of some of the most innovative, luxurious, and premium pontoon models to fit boaters needs, from brands such as Bennington, Barletta and Harris. Our runabouts, such as Cobalt, Regal and Chris-Craft, target the family recreational boating markets and come in a variety of configurations to suit each customers particular recreational boating style. The models we offer may include amenities such as advanced navigation electronics and sound systems, a variety of hull, deck, and cockpit designs that can include a swim platform, bow pulpit and raised bridges, and swivel bucket helm seats, lounge seats, sun pads, wet bars, built-in ice chests, and refreshment centers. With a variety of designs and options, the pontoon boats and runabouts we offer appeal to a broad audience of boat enthusiasts and existing customers.\nWake/Ski Boats. Revenue from wake/ski boats comprised 4% of our new boat revenue for fiscal year 2023. The ski boats we offer range from entry-level models to advanced models, from brands such as Axis and Malibu, all of which are designed to generate specific wakes for optimal skiing, surfing and wakeboarding performance and safety. With a broad range of designs and options, the ski boats we offer appeal to both competitive and recreational users.\nYachts. Revenue from yachts comprised 22% of our new boat revenue for fiscal year 2023. The yachts we offer range from traditional models to advanced models, from brands such as Absolute, Riviera, Tiara and Sunseeker. The yacht product lines typically include state-of-the-art designs with live-aboard luxuries, offering amenities such as flybridges with extensive guest seating; covered aft deck, which may be fully or partially enclosed, providing the boater with additional living space; an elegant salon; and multiple staterooms for accommodations.\nMotors, Trailers, Personal Water Crafts (PWC), Wholesale and Other. Revenue from motors, trailers, PWC, wholesale and other sales comprised 5% of our new boat revenue for fiscal year 2023. The motors and trailers we offer range in size, horsepower, length and style dependent upon the type of boat our customers may own. We offer PWC, primarily including models from Yamaha and Sea Doo, which appeal to a broad audience of customers. Wholesale sales primarily consist of transactions with other dealers and other sales include the remaining new inventory products we offer.\nFinance & Insurance Products\nAt each of our dealerships, our customers have the ability to finance their new or pre-owned boat purchase, purchase a third-party extended service contract and arrange insurance covering boat property, disability, gel sealant, fabric protection and casualty insurance coverage (collectively, finance & insurance). Our relationships with various national marine product lenders allow buyers to purchase retail installment contracts originated by us in accordance with existing pre-sale agreements between us and the lenders. These retail installment contracts provide us with a portion of the expected finance charges based on a variety of factors, including the buyers credit rating, the annual percentage rate of the contract and the lenders then-existing minimum required annual percentage rate. These contracts are subject to repayment by us upon buyer prepayment or default within a designated time period (typically within 180 days). To the extent required by applicable state law, our dealer groups are licensed to originate and sell retail installment contracts financing the sale of boats and other marine products.\nWe offer our customers third-party extended service contracts, which allow us to extend customers new boat coverage beyond the time frame or scope of the manufacturers standard hull and engine warranty. We also offer purchasers of pre-owned boats the ability to purchase a third-party extended service contract, even if the applicable boat is no longer covered by the manufacturers warranty. We also provide the related repair services, when needed by our customers, pursuant to the service contract guidelines during the contract term at no additional charge to the customer above a deductible. Generally, we receive a fee for arranging these extended service contracts and most of the required services under the contracts are provided by us and paid for by the third-party contract holder.\nWe also assist our customers with obtaining property and casualty insurance. Property and casualty insurance covers loss or damage to their boat. We do not act as an insurance broker or agent or issue insurance policies on behalf of insurers. We provide marketing activities and other related services to insurance companies and brokers for which we receive marketing fees. One of our strategies is to generate increased marketing fees by offering more competitive insurance products.\nFee income generated from finance & insurance products accounted for approximately $56.3 million or 2.9% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023. We believe that our customers ability to obtain competitive, prompt and convenient financing at our dealerships strengthens our ability to sell new and pre-owned boats and gives us an advantage over many of our competitors, particularly our smaller competitors that lack the resources to arrange boat financing at their dealerships or that do not generate enough finance & insurance product volume to attract the broad range of financing sources that are available to us.\nService, Parts & Other\nService, parts & other accounted for approximately $321.8 million or 16.6% of our revenue during fiscal year 2023 and is comprised of revenues generated from our Dealerships and Distribution reporting segments.\nDealerships\nWe provide repair and maintenance services at most of our dealerships. We believe that our repair and maintenance services help strengthen our customer relationships and that our quality service and emphasis on preventative maintenance increases the quality and supply of well-maintained boats available for our pre-owned boat business. We perform both warranty and non-warranty repair services, with the cost of warranty work reimbursed by the manufacturer in accordance with the manufacturers warranty reimbursement program. For any warranty work we perform, most of our manufacturers reimburse a percentage of the dealerships posted service labor rates, with the percentage varying depending on the dealerships customer satisfaction index rating and attendance at service training courses. Certain other of our manufacturers reimburse warranty work at a fixed amount per repair. Because boat manufacturers require that warranty work be performed at authorized dealerships, our dealerships receive substantially all of the warrantied repair and maintained work required for the boats we offer. We also offer third-party extended warranty contracts, which result in a continuous demand for our repair and maintenance services for the term of the extended warranty contract.\nWe offer engine parts, oils, lubricants, steering and control systems, electronics, safety products, water sport accessories (such as tubes, wakeboards, surfboards, lines, and lifejackets), products relating to docking and anchoring, boat covers, trailer parts, and a complete line of other boating accessories at our dealerships and online, primarily to retail customers to repair their current engines or other marine related parts and equipment.\nAt certain of our dealerships, we offer marina and boat rental services, which are generally recurring in nature and create additional opportunities to connect with potential buyers. We maintain a small fleet of rental boats, and, after one season, the rental boats are repurposed for pre-owned sales. Additionally, we operate 18 marina locations that provide fueling, docking and indoor and outdoor storage.\nOur focus on customer service, which we believe is one of our core competitive advantages in the retail marine industry, is critical to our efforts in creating and maintaining long-term customers.\nDistribution\nWe offer the sale of marine related parts and accessories along with appearance and maintenance products for the marine and other ancillary markets.\nThe acquisitions of T-H Marine and PartsVu expanded our sale of marine related parts and accessories, including general boat accessories, electronics (GPS, radar, sonar, etc.), original equipment manufacturer (OEM) marine parts, boat performance items, access hatches, deck plates, deck hardware, live well aeration, plumbing fittings, battery trays, fishing rod holders, boat lights, rigging accessories, trolling motor accessories, and safety equipment. These products are sold to boat manufacturers, distributors, big box retailers, boat dealerships and after-market customers.\nThe acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem further expanded our Distribution segment. Ocean Bio-Chem is principally engaged in the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle, home care and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite\u00ae and Star Tron\u00ae brand names. In addition, Ocean Bio-Chem produces private label formulations of many of its products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products. Ocean Bio-Chem also manufactures, markets and distributes chlorine dioxide-based deodorizing disinfectant, and sanitizing products under the Star brite\u00ae and Performacide\u00ae brand names, utilizing a patented delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide.\nWe believe this segment will advance our strategic growth and diversification strategies and is expected to materially expand our addressable market in the parts and accessories business. We believe that the expansion will allow us to drive deeper customer engagements through the offer of private label consumable products and may help partially offset the industry cyclicality of boat sales.\nLocations\nIn our Dealership segment, we offer new and pre-owned recreational boats and other related marine products and boat services through 98 dealerships in 15 states as of September 30, 2023. Each dealership generally includes an indoor showroom and an outside display area for our new and pre-owned boat inventories, along with a business office to facilitate finance & insurance products and repair and maintenance services facilities. We also have 11 locations spanning 6 states in our Distribution segment. The use of these facilities varies and primarily includes manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, warehouses, administrative and product testing centers.\nOperations\nOperations and Management\nThe operational management of our retail locations are decentralized, with certain administrative functions centralized at the corporate level and the primary responsibility of day-to-day operations localized at the dealership. Each location is managed by a general manager, often a former owner, who oversees the day-to-day operations and financial performance of that particular individual location. Typically, each retail location also has a staff consisting of sales representatives, a finance & insurance manager, a service manager, a parts manager, maintenance and repair technicians and additional support personnel. Distribution centers/warehouses typically have an on-site management team and warehouse workers. Sales, administrative functions and marketing for distribution centers/warehouses are primarily at a centralized level.\nWe provide employees with ongoing training, career advancement opportunities and favorable benefit packages as a part of our strategy to attract and retain high quality employees. Sales training sessions are held at various locations, including the manufacturers facilities, and cover a broad array of topics from technical product details, features and benefits, to general sales techniques. Our highly-trained professional sales teams recognize the importance of building relationships with customers, assisting them in selecting the boat that best fits their needs and making the entire sales process enjoyable, all of which are critical to our successful sales efforts. The overall focus of our training program is to provide exemplary customer service.\nMembers of our sales teams receive compensation primarily on a commission basis. Additionally, each manager within a dealership receives a salary along with incentive compensation based on the performance of the managed location or their respective departments.\nSales and Marketing\nOur sales strategy focuses on highlighting the joys of the boating lifestyle while also providing convenient repair and maintenance services to maintain a stress-free boating experience. Our sales strategy is built on our high levels of customer service, hassle-free sales approach, appealing dealership layouts, highly-trained sales teams and the ability of our sales teams to educate customers and their families on boating. We constantly aim to provide the highest levels of customer service and support before, during and after each sale.\nEach of our dealerships offer our customers the opportunity to evaluate a variety of new and pre-owned boats in an environment that is convenient, comfortable and professional. Our dealerships provide a full-service purchasing process, which includes attractive finance & insurance packages and extended third-party service agreements. We have a number of waterfront dealerships, most of which include marina-type facilities and docks at which we display our new and pre-owned boats. These waterfront dealerships and marinas are easily accessible to boating customers, operate as in-water showrooms and enable our sales team to give potential customers impromptu in-water demonstrations of our various boat models. Our sales team members are providing certain customers with the option of in-person or virtual walkthroughs of inventory and/or private, at home or on water showings. We continue to expand our online presence and sales through digital platforms to engage in online new and pre-owned boat sales, parts and accessories as well as finance & insurance products. We continue to launch tools for our internally developed customer relationship management system, our websites and online sales portals, which we expect to be further enhanced by our continued investments in digital initiatives.\nWe provide customers a diverse offering of boat brands, which span across a multitude of sizes, uses and activities, including leisure, fishing, watersports, luxury and vacation. We believe this diverse offering of brands allows us to reach a broad expanse of customers and maximizes our ability to provide high quality service to each customer that walks into one of our dealerships.\nAn important part of our sales strategy is our participation in boat shows and specialized events in areas with high levels of boating activity. These shows and events help drive sales during and after the show or event and are typically held in January, February, March and toward the end of the boating season at convention centers or marinas that have been rented out by area dealers. Additionally, we focus on customer education through personalized education by our sales representatives and other professionals, before, during and after a sale through product demonstrations on the use and operation of their boat. Typically, one of our delivery professionals or the sales representative delivers the customers boat to the customers boating location and thoroughly instructs the customer about the operation of the boat, including hands-on instructions for docking and trailering the boat.\nWith the addition of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, we sell our manufactured and assembled products through national retailers, direct to OEM manufacturers and online. Our branded and private label products are sold through national retailers such as Wal-Mart, Tractor Supply, West Marine and Bass Pro Shops. Additionally, we market our products via online retailers such as Amazon. We also sell to national and regional distributors that resell our products to specialized retail outlets.\nSuppliers and Inventory Management\nWe purchase substantially all of our new boat inventory directly from manufacturers. Manufacturers typically allocate new boats to dealerships or dealer groups based on the amount of boats sold by the dealership or dealer group and their market share. We exchange new boats with other dealers to maintain flexibility, meet customer demand and balance inventory. We also display a select number of boats and yachts through consignment agreements, including with related parties.\nWe offer a wide array of new boats at various price points through relationships with 49 manufacturers covering 70 brands. We believe we are currently a top-three customer for 29 of our 70 brands and the single largest customer for each of our top five highest-selling brands. While we believe our order volume amounts to between 10% to 40% of total sales for those top five brands, no single brand accounts for more than 8% of our total sales volume. Additionally, our top brand only accounts for approximately 12% of new boat sales. However, sales of new boats from the top ten brands represent approximately 39.4% of our total sales volume for fiscal year 2023.\nAs part of our business, we enter into renewable annual dealer agreements with boat manufacturers. Provided that we are in compliance with the material obligations of such dealer agreements, they designate an exclusive geographical territory for our dealership to sell a particular boat brand and typically do not restrict our right to sell any other product lines or competing products.\nWe are able to transfer boats between our dealerships to maintain flexibility, meet customer demand and balance inventories. This flexibility reduces delays in delivery, helps us maximize inventory turnover and assists in minimizing potential overstock or out-of-stock situations. We actively monitor our inventory levels to maintain levels appropriate to meet current anticipated market demands. We are not bound by contractual agreements governing the amount of inventory that we must purchase in any year from any manufacturer; however, the failure to purchase at agreed upon levels may result in the loss of certain manufacturer incentives or dealership rights.\nWe also maintain diverse relationships with domestic and international suppliers of products and raw materials that are used in our Distribution segment. Our sophisticated sourcing model allows us to acquire products and materials at competitive prices. We believe that these relationships, many of which have been in place for 10+ years, allows for industry leading delivery times, flexible capacity to support growth, and category expansion. These relationships also allow us to reduce capital expenditure requirements to produce core components but allows us to assemble the components or systems our customers need.\nOur inventory turnover ratio, which is calculated as cost of goods sold for the period divided by the average inventory over the same period, was 2.9x and 4.6x for fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInventory Financing\nBoat manufacturers customarily provide various levels of interest assistance programs to retailers, which may include periods of free financing or reduced interest rate programs. The interest assistance may be paid directly to the retailer or the financial institution depending on the arrangements the manufacturer has established. We believe that our financing arrangements with manufacturers are standard within the industry.\nWe are party to our Inventory Financing Facility (as defined below). For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, interest on new boats and for rental units was calculated using the Adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility section below). For the years ended September 30, 2021, interest on new boats and for rental units was calculated using the legacy one month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR). Our Inventory Financing Facility requires us to pay the benchmark rate plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 5.00% depending on the age of the inventory. The interest rate for pre-owned boats is calculated using the new boat rate set forth above plus 0.25%.\nThe collateral for the Inventory Financing Facility consists primarily of our inventory that is financed through the Inventory Financing Facility and related assets, including accounts receivable, bank accounts, and proceeds of the foregoing, and excludes the collateral that underlies our A&R Credit Facility (as defined below). For additional information relating to the terms of our Inventory Financing Facility, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Debt Agreements-Inventory Financing Facility.\nCustomers\nWe are not dependent on any one customer or group of customers, and no individual customer, or together with its affiliates, contributed on an aggregate basis 10% or more to our revenues.\nSeasonality\nOur business, along with the entire retail marine industry, is highly seasonal, and such seasonality varies by geographic market. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories, and related floor plan borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. Revenue generated from our dealerships in Florida serves to offset generally lower winter revenue in our other states and enables us to maintain a more consistent revenue stream. Over the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, the average revenue for the quarters ended December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 represented approximately 19%, 26%, 32%, and 23%, respectively, of our average annual revenues. Every January, the onset of consumer boat and recreation shows generally marks the beginning of an increase in boat sales which allows us to begin to reduce our inventory levels and related short-term borrowings for the remainder of the fiscal year.\nOur limited ability to participate in boat shows in our existing target markets, including cancellation of boat shows for any reason, including a pandemic, could have an impact on our seasonality. To the extent boat shows may be delayed or cancelled, we intend to hold complementary sales events on a smaller, more personalized scale.\nOur business is also sensitive to weather patterns, such as unseasonably cool weather, prolonged winter conditions, drought conditions (or merely reduced rainfall levels) or excessive rain, which may shorten the selling season, limit access to certain locations for boating or render boating hazardous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services and adversely affecting our results of operations. Additionally, hurricanes and other storms may cause disruptions to our business operations or damage to our inventories and facilities. We believe our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area.\nEnvironmental and Other Regulatory Issues\nOur business operations, along with the entire retail marine industry, are subject to numerous environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may be imposed in the United States at the federal, state and local levels. Federal agencies that implement and enforce these laws and regulations include the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The more significant of these environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following federal legal standards that currently exist in the United States, as amended from time to time:\nthe Clean Air Act (CAA), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including outboard marine engines and chemical manufacturing operations, and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions;\nthe Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the Clean Water Act), which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;\nthe Oil Pollution Act (OPA), which subjects owners and operators of vessels, onshore facilities, and pipelines, as well as lessees or permittees of areas in which offshore facilities are located, to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;\nthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;\nthe Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, which requires facilities to implement a safety hazard communication program and disseminate information to employees, local emergency planning committees, and fire departments on toxic chemical uses and inventories; and\nthe Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures.\nAdditionally, there exist state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities, which requirements may impose additional, or more stringent, conditions or controls than required under federal law and that can significantly alter, delay or cancel the permitting, development, or expansion of operations or substantially increase the cost of doing business. Environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations, including new or amended legal requirements that may arise in the future to address potential environmental concerns such as air and water impacts or to address perceived human health or safety-related concerns, including a global or national health crisis, are expected to continue to have a considerable impact on our operations.\nAs with companies in the marine retail industry generally, and parts and service operations in particular, our business involves the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of petroleum-based products and wastes, as well as other hazardous and toxic substances and wastes, including gasoline, diesel fuels, motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, and degreasing agents. Environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations generally impose requirements for the use, storage, management, handling, transport and disposal of these materials, and restrict the level of pollutants emitted into the environment, including into ambient air, discharges to surface water, and disposals or other releases to surface and below-ground soils and ground water. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties or liabilities to third parties; the imposition of investigatory, remedial, and corrective action obligations or the incurrence of capital expenditures; the occurrence of restrictions, delays or cancellations in the permitting, development, or expansion of projects; and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in a particular area. Moreover, there exist environmental laws that provide for citizen suits, which allow individuals or organizations to act in the place of the government and sue operators for alleged violations of environmental law.\nAdditionally, like other manufacturers, the manufacturing operations of Ocean Bio-Chem are subject to extensive Federal, state and local environmental laws and requirements concerning emissions to the air, discharges onto land or surface waters, and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. Many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines or penalties. Existing or future regulations may restrict our operations, increase our costs of operations or require us to make additional capital expenditures.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations governing the investigation and remediation of contamination at the facilities we currently or formerly own or operate, as well as at third-party sites to which we send hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. Some environmental laws, such as CERCLA and similar state statutes, impose strict joint and several liability for the entire cost of investigation or remediation of a contaminated property and for any related damages to natural resources, upon current or former site owners or operators, as well as persons who arranged for the transportation, treatment or disposal of hazardous substances. We may also be subject to third-party claims alleging property damage and/or personal injury in connection with releases of, or exposure to, hazardous substances at our current or former properties or off-site waste disposal sites or from the products we sell.\nAdditionally, certain of our locations utilize underground storage tanks (USTs) and aboveground storage tanks (ASTs), primarily for storing and dispensing petroleum-based products. The USTs and ASTs are generally subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that require obtaining financial assurance to own or operate USTs and ASTs, testing and upgrading of tanks and remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater resulting from leaking tanks. Additionally, if leakage from our USTs or ASTs migrates onto the property of others, we may be liable to third parties for remediation costs, natural resource damages or other damages.\nIncreasingly strict environmental laws and inspection and enforcement policies, could affect the handling, manufacture, use, emission or disposal of products, other materials or hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Stricter environmental, safety and health laws, regulations and enforcement policies could result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures to comply with such laws and regulations. Additionally, we are required to have permits for our businesses and are subject to licensing regulations. These permits and licenses are subject to renewal, modification and in some circumstances, revocation.\nFor additional information relating to environmental protection, including releases, discharges and emissions into the environment, as well as worker health and safety requirements, please see Risk Factors- Risks Related to Environmental and Geographic Factors-Climatic events may adversely impact our operations, disrupt the business of our third party vendors on whom we rely upon for products and services, and may not be adequately covered by our insurance, -Environmental and other regulatory issues impact our operations from time to time and Our operations are subject to risks arising out of the threat of climate change, which could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products that we and the retail recreational boat industry provide. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nProduct Liability\nOur sale and servicing of boats and other watercraft as well as the sale of parts and accessories which we manufacture may expose us to potential liabilities for personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of such products. Historically, product liability claims have not materially affected our business. Our manufacturers generally maintain product liability insurance, and we maintain third-party liability insurance with respect to the sale and servicing of boats and other watercrafts, which we believe to be adequate. However, we may experience legal claims in excess of our insurance coverage, and those claims may not be covered by insurance. Furthermore, any significant claims against us, or an increase in insurance premiums resulting from excessive insurance claims, could adversely affect our business, financial performance and results of operations and result in negative publicity.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We face competition from businesses relating to recreational activities, which businesses compete for consumers leisure time and discretionary spending dollars. We face intense competition within the highly fragmented marine retail industry for customers, quality products, boat show space and suitable dealership locations. We rely to a certain extent on boat shows to generate sales. Our inability to participate in boat shows in our existing or targeted markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nWe compete primarily with local marine retailers who own three or fewer stores, as well as with a limited number of larger operators, including MarineMax and Bass Pro Shops. Additionally, with respect to sales of marine parts, accessories, and equipment, we also compete with national specialty marine parts and accessory stores, online catalog retailers, sporting goods stores, and mass merchants. Competition within the retail marine industry is generally based on the quality and variety of available products, the price and value of the products and services and attention to customer service. We face significant competition from our current market and will likely face significant competition in any new markets that we may enter. We also face competition from retailers in certain markets who sell boat brands, parts and engines that we do not currently carry in such markets. Additionally, a number of our competitors are large national or regional chains that have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than us, especially with regard to those that sell boating accessories. We also face competition from private sellers of pre-owned boats and online merchants entering the resale boating industry. However, we believe that our integrated corporate infrastructure, marketing and sales capabilities, cost structure, industry expertise and customer experience enable us to compete effectively against these competitors.\nIntellectual Property\nWe are the registered holder of a U.S. trademark and a domain name that include our primary brand name OneWater. Additionally, we have obtained registered trademarks for Star brite\u00ae, Star Tron\u00ae, Performacide\u00ae and other trade names used on our products. We also rely on a number of trade names with respect to the regional dealer groups that we have acquired, which we do not re-brand under our OneWater mark. We view our trademarks as significant assets because they provide product recognition. We believe that our trademarks provide protection in the geographic markets we serve, but we cannot assure that our intellectual property rights can be maintained or successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. We cannot give any assurance that any trade name and trademark applications that we may file in the future will be granted.\nWe own several patents, the most significant of which relate to a delivery system for use with products containing chlorine dioxide. In 2021, we were issued a new patent for our ClO2 delivery system that expires on July 8, 2039. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-We may be unable to adequately maintain, enforce, and protect our intellectual property rights and we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, and operations, in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves risks. Before making any investment decision, you should carefully consider the information in this Form 10-K, including the risks described below, the matters addressed under Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Some of these risks include:\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe availability and costs of borrowed funds can adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate boat inventory, the ability and willingness of our customers to finance boat purchases and our ability to fund future acquisitions.\nFailure to implement strategies to enhance our performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions at attractive or fair prices and to integrate the operations of acquired marine retailers and each marine retailer we acquire in the future.\nWe are required to obtain the consent of our manufacturers prior to the acquisition of other dealers.\nOur failure to successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect consumer demand and to anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends, or the lack or excess of inventory in the industry, generally, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOneWater Inc. is a holding company. OneWater Inc.s only material asset is its equity interest in OneWater LLC, and OneWater Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from OneWater LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover OneWater Inc.s corporate and other overhead expenses.\nIf we experience any material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nOur Legacy Owners own a significant amount of our voting stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nWe may be unable to adequately maintain, enforce, and protect our intellectual property rights and we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks or uncertainties discussed herein. The trading price of our Class A common stock could decline due to any of these risks discussed herein, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or future results. Certain statements made herein are forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to General Economic Conditions\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions, including changes in employment levels, consumer demand, preferences and confidence levels, the availability and cost of credit, fuel prices, levels of discretionary personal income, interest rates, periods of economic or political instability, public health crises, inflation, and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national or global economic developments or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects could reduce or defer consumer spending in the markets we serve and adversely affect our business. Consumer spending, including that of high net worth individuals, on discretionary goods may also decline as a result of political uncertainty and instability, even if prevailing economic conditions are generally favorable. Economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships, particularly the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions in which we generated approximately 81%, 79% and 80% of our revenue during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, could have a major impact on our operations. Local influences, such as corporate downsizing, inclement weather such as hurricanes, wintry conditions or other storms, environmental conditions and specific events, also could adversely affect, and in certain instances have adversely affected, our operations in certain markets.\nIn an economic downturn, consumer discretionary spending levels generally decline, at times resulting in disproportionately large reductions in the sale of discretionary goods. Consumer spending on discretionary goods also may decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels, even if prevailing economic conditions are favorable. Our business was significantly impacted during the recessionary period that began in 2007, and this period of weakness in consumer spending and depressed economic conditions had a substantial negative effect on our operating results. In response to these conditions we reduced our inventory purchases, closed certain dealerships and reduced headcount. Although we have expanded our operations and increased our focus on pre-owned sales, parts and repair services and finance & insurance products, during periods of stagnant or modestly declining industry trends, the cyclical nature of the retail marine industry or the lack of industry growth could lead to oversupply and weak demand, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future. Any period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence could have a negative effect on our business.\nInflation could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe market prices of certain materials and components used by us and/or our suppliers in manufacturing the products we sell can be volatile. Significant increases in inflation, particularly those related to wages and increases in the cost of raw materials, and the expenses associated with the distribution and transportation of these materials and products we sell, can have an adverse impact on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of us or our suppliers. The inflationary pressure on labor costs could lead to a reduction in profitability, as we may face challenges in maintaining our margins on boats and other distributed products. Additionally, the increased costs in raw materials and transportation could further strain our supply chain, leading to higher operational expenses. Our suppliers may in turn pass such increases along to us by raising the cost of our inventories and/or we may not be able to fully pass along these increased costs onto our customers. These market dynamics may adversely impact our profitability.\nIn addition, new boat buyers often finance their purchases. Inflation, along with rising interest rates, translates into an increased cost of boat ownership, which can negatively impact our customers' ability or desire to purchase our products. Should inflation and increased rates continue to occur, prospective consumers may choose to forego or delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat in the event credit is not available to finance their boat purchases affecting our profitability and margins.\nOur sales may be adversely affected by a material increase in interest rates and adverse changes in fiscal policy or credit market conditions.\nSince 2008, the U.S. Federal Reserve System has generally maintained policies producing a historically low-interest-rate environment. Interest rates rose throughout 2022 and 2023 and may continue to rise, and there can be no assurance as to what actions the Federal Reserve System will take in the future. Any change in interest rates or the market expectation of such change may result in significantly higher long-term interest rates.\nGiven that we sell products that are often financed, material increases in interest rates and adverse changes in fiscal policy or credit market conditions have, from time to time, negatively impacted our customers ability or desire to purchase our products and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, such an increase or adverse change could reduce the availability or increase the costs of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness or negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Competition\nOur success depends to a significant extent on our manufacturers, and the loss of certain manufacturers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe depend on our manufacturers for the sale of new boats. Sales of new boats from our top ten brands represents approximately 39.4%, 41.8% and 42.9% of total sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, making them major suppliers of our company. Of this amount, Malibu Boats, Inc., including its brands Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, Pursuit, Maverick, Hewes, Cobia and Pathfinder accounted for 13.9%, 15.6% and 17.0% of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any adverse change in the reputation, product development efforts, technological advancement, manufacturing capabilities, supply chain and third-party suppliers and financial condition of our manufacturers and their respective brands, would have a substantial adverse impact on our business. Any difficulties encountered by our manufacturers resulting from economic, financial, or other factors could also adversely affect the quality and amount of new boats and products that they are able to supply to us and the services and support they provide to us.\nAdditionally, any interruption or discontinuance of the operations of our manufacturers, including due to, supply chain disruptions or shortages or bankruptcy or insolvency, could also cause us to experience shortfalls, disruptions, or delays with respect to new boats and inventory. During the course of the pandemic, a number of our manufacturers faced inventory shortages due to a combination of these facts as well as high demand. We also enter into renewable annual dealer agreements with manufacturers, and there is no guarantee that we will be able to renew such dealer agreements in the future. We may not be able to easily replace the loss of certain manufacturers or brands, including at the necessary quantity, quality or price, and the loss of certain manufacturers or brands may therefore have an adverse material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nBoat manufacturers exercise control over our business.\nWe depend on our dealer agreements, which generally provide for renewable, one-year terms. Through dealer agreements, boat manufacturers exercise control over their dealers, restrict them to specified locations and retain approval rights over changes in management and ownership, among other things. The continuation of our dealer agreements with most manufacturers depends upon, among other things, our achieving stated performance goals for customer satisfaction ratings and market share penetration in the market served by the applicable marine retailer. Failure to meet performance goals and other conditions set forth in any existing or new dealer agreement could have various consequences, including the following:\nthe termination or nonrenewal of the dealer agreement;\nthe imposition of additional conditions in subsequent dealer agreements;\nlimitations on boat inventory allocations;\nreductions in reimbursement rates for warranty work performed by the dealer;\nloss of certain manufacturer-to-dealer incentives;\ndenial of approval of future acquisitions; or\nthe loss of exclusive rights to sell in the geographic territory.\nThese events could have a material adverse effect on our product availability, competitive position and financial performance.\nManufacturer recall campaigns could adversely affect our business.\nManufacturer recall campaigns could adversely affect our new and pre-owned boat sales or customer residual trade-in valuations, could cause us to temporarily remove boats from our inventory, could force us to incur increased costs and could expose us to litigation and adverse publicity related to the sale of recalled boats, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business, as well as the entire retail marine industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets.\nOver the three-year period ended September 30, 2023, the average revenue for the quarterly periods ended December 31, March 31, June 30 and September 30 represented approximately 19%, 26%, 32% and 23%, respectively, of our average annual revenue. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories, and related floor plan borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. Revenue generated from our dealerships in Florida serves to offset generally lower winter revenue in our other states and enables us to maintain a more consistent revenue stream. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January stimulates boat sales and allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related floor plan borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. We also have various dealerships in the Northeast and Midwest region of the United States, which typically experience colder temperatures in the winter months. The impact of seasonality on our results of operations could be materially impacted based on the location of our acquisitions. For example, the impact of seasonality could change if we acquire additional marine retailers that operate in colder regions of the United States, or if we acquire additional distribution businesses. Additionally, due to pandemic or other external factors, our seasonal trends may also change as a result of, among other things, dealership closures, disruptions to the supply chain and inventory availability, manufacturer delays, or cancellation of boat shows.\nThe failure to receive rebates and other manufacturer incentives on inventory purchases or retail sales could substantially reduce our margins.\nWe rely on manufacturers programs that provide incentives for dealers to purchase and sell particular boat makes and models or for consumers to buy particular boat makes or models. Any eliminations, reductions, limitations or other changes relating to rebate or incentive programs that have the effect of reducing the benefits we receive, whether relating to the ability of manufacturers to pay or our ability to qualify for such incentive programs, could increase the effective cost of our boat purchases, reduce our margins and competitive position and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOther recreational activities, poor industry perception, real or perceived human health or safety risks, changing consumer attitudes and environmental conditions can adversely affect the levels of boat purchases.\nOther recreational activities, poor industry perception, real or perceived human health or safety risks, changing consumer attitudes and environmental conditions can adversely affect the levels of boat purchases. Demand for our products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. In addition, real or perceived human health or safety risks from engaging in outdoor activities generally or boating activities specifically could deter consumers from purchasing our products. Local environmental conditions in the areas in which we operate dealerships could also adversely affect the levels of boat purchases, including adverse weather conditions or natural disasters. Changing trends and attitudes toward large discretionary purchases on the part of younger consumers in particular, who may prefer to share or borrow a boat rather than incur the expense of ownership, may impact our future sales. Further, as a seller of high-end consumer products, we must compete for discretionary spending with a wide variety of other recreational activities and consumer purchases. In addition, perceived hassles of boat ownership and customer service and customer education throughout the retail boat industry, which has traditionally been perceived to be relatively poor, represent impediments to boat purchases. We may attempt to shift the focus or product mix in response to changing consumer sentiments, but there is no guarantee that we will be successful.\nWe face intense competition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. In addition to facing competition generally from recreation businesses seeking to attract consumers leisure time and discretionary spending dollars, the recreational boat industry itself is highly fragmented, resulting in intense competition for customers, quality products, boat show space and suitable dealership locations. We rely to a certain extent on boat shows to generate sales. Our inability to participate in boat shows in our existing or targeted markets, including due to cancellations of boat shows, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete primarily with local marine retailers who own three or fewer stores, as well as with a limited number of larger operators, including MarineMax and Bass Pro Shops. Additionally, with respect to sales of marine parts, accessories, and equipment, we also compete with national specialty marine parts and accessory stores, online catalog retailers, sporting goods stores, and mass merchants. Competition within the retail marine industry is generally based on the quality and variety of available products, the price and value of the products, and attention to customer service. There is significant competition both within markets we currently serve and in new markets that we may enter. We compete in each of our markets with retailers of brands of boats and engines we do not sell in that market. In addition, several of our competitors, especially those selling marine equipment and accessories, are large national or regional chains that have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. Private sales of pre-owned boats represent an additional source of competition.\nAdditional competitors, including boat clubs, may enter the businesses in which we currently operate or intend to expand. In particular, an increase in the number of aggregator and price comparison sites for our products may negatively impact our sales of these products. If any of our competitors successfully provides a broader, more efficient or attractive combination of services, protection plans, products and resources to our target customers, our business results could be materially adversely affected. Our inability to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to various matters, including environmental concerns, permitting and zoning requirements, and competition for waterfront real estate, some markets in the United States have experienced an increased waiting list for marina and storage availability. In general, the markets in which we currently operate are not experiencing any unusual difficulties. However, marine retail activity could be adversely affected in markets that do not have sufficient marina and storage availability to satisfy demand.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisition and Growth Strategies\nFailure to implement strategies to enhance our performance could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are increasing our efforts to grow our distribution, repair and maintenance services, parts and accessories, and financing and insurance businesses to better serve our customers and thereby increase revenue and improve profitability as a result of these comparatively higher margin businesses. These efforts are designed to increase our revenue and reduce our dependence on the sale of new and pre-owned boats. In addition, we are pursuing strategic acquisitions to capitalize upon the consolidation opportunities in the highly fragmented recreational boat dealer industry by acquiring additional marine retailers and related operations and improving their performance and profitability through the implementation of our operating strategies. These business initiatives have required, and will continue to require, us to add personnel, invest capital, enter businesses or geographic regions in which we do not have extensive experience and encounter substantial competition. As a result, our strategies to enhance our performance may not be successful and we may increase our expenses or write off or impair such investments if not successful.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions at attractive or fair prices and to integrate the operations of acquired marine retailers and each marine retailer we acquire in the future.\nSince the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine in 2014, we have acquired 80 additional dealerships and 12 warehouses/distribution centers through 33 acquisitions. Additionally, we actively evaluate and pursue acquisitions on an ongoing basis. We continue to strategically evaluate and monitor our pipeline for potential acquisitions. Each acquired marine retailer operated independently prior to our acquisition. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to make successful acquisitions at attractive or fair prices that align with our culture and focus on customer service and to integrate the operations of acquired marine retailers, including centralizing certain functions to achieve cost savings and pursuing programs and processes that promote cooperation and the sharing of opportunities and resources among our companies. We may not be able to oversee the combined entity efficiently, realize anticipated synergies or effectively implement our growth and operating strategies. To the extent that we successfully pursue our acquisition strategy, our resulting growth will place significant additional demands on our management and infrastructure. Our failure to successfully pursue our acquisition strategies or effectively operate the combined entity could have a material adverse effect on our rate of growth and operating performance. Further, if we acquire businesses or products that depend on a small number of customers and we are unable to retain key customers following the acquisition, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nUnforeseen expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability.\nOur growth strategy of acquiring additional marine retailers involves significant risks. This strategy entails reviewing and potentially reorganizing acquired business operations, corporate infrastructure and systems, and financial controls. We continue to integrate acquired marine retailers, including T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, and these activities may require management to devote significant attention and resources to integrating acquired businesses with our business. Unforeseen expenses (including potential environmental legacy liabilities due to spills or other releases of regulated substances on or under real properties or resulting from a failure to comply with laws and regulations), difficulties and delays frequently encountered in connection with rapid expansion through acquisitions could inhibit our growth and negatively impact our profitability. We may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates or to complete the acquisitions of candidates that we identify. Even if we are able to integrate acquired business operations successfully, there can be no assurance that the integration will result in the realization of the full benefit of synergies, cost savings, margin growth, insulation from cyclicality or operation effectiveness that we may expect or that any such benefits may be achieved within an anticipated time frame. Increased competition for acquisition candidates or increased asking prices by acquisition candidates may increase purchase prices for acquisitions to levels beyond our financial capability or to levels that would not result in expected returns required by our acquisition criteria to be in the best interest of stockholders or bondholders. Acquisitions also may become more difficult or less attractive in the future as we acquire more of the most attractive marine retailers that best align with our culture and focus on customer service. In addition, we may encounter difficulties in integrating the operations of acquired marine retailers with our own operations, in retaining employees, in retaining and maintaining relationships with customers, suppliers or other business contacts, and in managing acquired marine retailers profitably without substantial costs, delays or other operational or financial problems. As part of our growth strategy, we generally retain existing key staff, including senior management, when we complete an acquisition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain marine retailers key staff, including senior management, when we complete an acquisition in the future and failure to do so could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe may issue common or preferred stock, or membership interests in OneWater LLC, and incur substantial indebtedness in making future acquisitions. The size, timing, and integration of any future acquisitions may cause substantial fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter. Consequently, operating results for any quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent quarter or for a full fiscal year. These fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur ability to continue to grow through the acquisition of additional marine retailers will depend upon various factors, including the following:\nthe availability of suitable acquisition candidates at attractive purchase prices;\nthe ability to compete effectively for available acquisition opportunities;\nthe availability of cash on hand, borrowed funds, common stock with a sufficient market price or other sources of financing to complete the acquisitions;\nthe ability to obtain any requisite manufacturer, governmental or other required approvals;\nthe ability to obtain approval of our lenders under our current credit agreements; and\nthe absence of one or more manufacturers attempting to impose unsatisfactory restrictions on us in connection with their approval of acquisitions.\nAs a part of our acquisition strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with various marine retail groups regarding their potential acquisition by us. In connection with these discussions, we and each potential acquisition candidate exchange confidential operational and financial information, conduct due diligence inquiries and consider the structure, terms, and conditions of the potential acquisition. In certain cases, the prospective acquisition candidate agrees not to discuss a potential acquisition with any other party for a specific period of time, grants us an option to purchase the prospective marine retailers for a designated price during a specific time period, and agrees to take other actions designed to enhance the possibility of the acquisition, such as preparing audited financial information and converting its accounting system to the system specified by us. Potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues, including in some cases management succession and related matters. As a result of these and other factors, a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated.\nWe are required to obtain the consent of our manufacturers prior to the acquisition of other dealers.\nIn determining whether to approve acquisitions, manufacturers may consider many factors, including our financial condition and ownership structure. Manufacturers may also impose conditions on granting their approvals for acquisitions, including a limitation on the number of their dealers that we may acquire. Our ability to meet manufacturers requirements for approving future acquisitions will have a direct bearing on our ability to complete acquisitions and effect our growth strategy. There can be no assurance that a manufacturer will not terminate its dealer agreement, refuse to renew its dealer agreement, refuse to approve future acquisitions or take other action that could have a material adverse effect on our acquisition program.\nOur growth strategy also entails expanding our product lines and geographic scope by obtaining additional distribution rights from our existing and new manufacturers. We may not be able to secure additional distribution rights or obtain suitable alternative sources of supply if we are unable to obtain such distribution rights. The inability to expand our product lines and geographic scope by obtaining additional distribution rights could have a material adverse effect on the growth and profitability of our business.\nOur internal growth and operating strategies of opening new dealerships and offering new products involve risk.\nIn addition to pursuing growth by acquiring marine retailers, we intend to continue to pursue a strategy of growth through opening new dealerships and offering new products in our existing and new territories. Accomplishing these goals for expansion will depend upon a number of factors, including the following:\nour ability to identify new markets in which we can obtain distribution rights to sell our existing or additional product lines;\nour ability to lease or construct suitable facilities at a reasonable cost in existing or new markets;\nour ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel;\nthe timely and effective integration of new dealerships into existing operations;\nour ability to achieve adequate market penetration at favorable operating margins without the acquisition of existing marine retailers; and\nour financial resources.\nOur dealer agreements require manufacturer consent to open or change dealership locations that sell certain products. We may not be able to open and operate new dealership locations or introduce new product lines on a timely or profitable basis. Moreover, the costs associated with opening new dealership locations or introducing new product lines may adversely affect our profitability.\nAs a result of these growth strategies, we expect to continue to expend significant time and effort in opening and acquiring new dealership locations, improving existing dealership locations in our current markets, and introducing new products. Our systems, procedures, controls, and financial resources may not be adequate to support expanding operations. The inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur planned growth also will impose significant added responsibilities on members of senior management and require us to identify, recruit, and integrate additional senior level managers. We may not be able to identify, hire or train suitable additions to management.\nOur growth strategy may require us to secure significant additional capital, the amount of which will depend upon the size, timing and structure of future acquisitions and our working capital and general corporate needs.\nIf we finance future acquisitions in whole or in part through the issuance of common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock, existing stockholders will experience dilution in the voting power of their common stock and earnings per share could be negatively impacted. The extent to which we will be able and willing to use our common stock or membership interests in OneWater LLC for acquisitions will depend on the market value of our common stock and the willingness of potential sellers to accept our common stock or membership interests in OneWater LLC as full or partial consideration. Our inability to use our common stock or membership interests in OneWater LLC as consideration, to generate cash from operations or to obtain additional funding through debt or equity financings in order to pursue our acquisition program could materially limit our growth.\nAny borrowings made to finance future acquisitions or for operations could make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our operating results, a downturn in economic conditions, or increases in interest rates on borrowings that are subject to interest rate fluctuations. If our cash flow from operations is insufficient to meet our debt service requirements, we could be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance our obligations or dispose of assets in order to meet our debt service requirements. In addition, our credit arrangements contain financial covenants and other restrictions with which we must comply, including limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness. Adequate financing may not be available if and when we need it or may not be available on terms acceptable to us. The failure to obtain sufficient financing on favorable terms and conditions could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects and our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information relating to our credit arrangements, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Debt Agreements in this Form 10-K.\nWith our growth and diversification strategy into marine related parts, products and accessories, we now import, assemble and/or manufacturer marine parts, products and accessories, which could expose us to potential increased costs and certain additional risks.\nOur acquisitions of Ocean Bio-Chem, T-H Marine and PartsVu expanded our business to include the import, assembly, manufacture and sale of marine parts and accessories. We may invest considerable resources to develop, import, warehouse and distribute new and existing parts, products and accessories, and there is no assurance that they will be successful. Consequently, we might curtail or abandon them at any time, which could result in asset impairments and inventory write-downs.\nFactors that could cause us to curtail or abandon one of such products include unexpected or increased costs or delays in development or manufacturing, excessive demands on management resources, legal or regulatory constraints, changes in consumer demands, preferences and shopping patterns regarding boat parts and accessories, or a determination that consumer demand no longer supports the product. Additional risks relating to such product offerings include product liability and product recalls for which we do not have third-party indemnification and contractual rights or remedies; increasing costs for labor or raw materials used to manufacture products; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights (e.g., defending against counterfeit or otherwise unauthorized goods) and intellectual property rights; our ability to successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; and our ability to successfully administer and comply with obligations under license agreements that we have with third-party licensors of certain brands.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nThe availability and costs of borrowed funds can adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate boat inventory, the ability and willingness of our customers to finance boat purchases and our ability to fund future acquisitions.\nThe availability and costs of borrowed funds can adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain adequate boat inventory and the holding costs of that inventory, the ability and willingness of our customers to finance boat purchases and our ability to fund future acquisitions.\nOneWater LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are parties to the Inventory Financing Facility, which consists of uncommitted inventory floorplan financing of up to $650.0 million as of November 14, 2023. Failure to extend or source alternative financing arrangements could adversely impact our business. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had an aggregate of $489.0 million and $267.1 million, respectively, outstanding under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility, which consisted of uncommitted inventory floorplan financing of up to $550.0 million as of September 30, 2023. We rely on the Inventory Financing Facility to purchase and maintain our inventory of boats. For additional information relating to the terms of our Inventory Financing Facility including the entrance into the Eighth Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement on November 14, 2023, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Debt Agreements-Inventory Financing Facility.\nEffective August 9, 2022, we entered into the A&R Credit Facility (together with the Inventory Financing Facility, the Credit Facilities), which provides for, among other things, (i) a single tranche of Revolving Commitments in an amount equal to $65.0 million (the Revolving Facility) and (ii) a single tranche of Initial Term Loans in an aggregate principal amount equal to $445.0 million (the Term Facility). As of September 30, 2023, we had $428.3 million outstanding under the Term Facility and $30.0 million outstanding under the Revolving Facility. For additional information, please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nOur ability to borrow under the Credit Facilities depends on our ability to continue to satisfy our covenants and other obligations under the Credit Facilities. In particular, our ability to borrow under our Inventory Financing Facility depends on the ability of our manufacturers to be approved vendors under our Inventory Financing Facility. The aging of our inventory limits our borrowing capacity as defined curtailments under the Inventory Financing Facility reduce the allowable advance rate as our inventory ages. Depressed economic conditions, weak consumer spending, turmoil in the credit markets and lender difficulties, among other potential reasons, could interfere with our ability to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and to utilize the Credit Facilities to fund our operations. Accordingly, under such circumstances, it may be necessary for us to close dealerships, further reduce our expense structure, liquidate inventory below cost to free up capital, or seek to modify the covenants with our lenders. Any inability to utilize the Credit Facilities or the acceleration of amounts owed, resulting from a covenant violation, insufficient collateral or lender difficulties, could require us to seek other sources of funding to repay amounts outstanding under the Credit Facilities or replace or supplement the Credit Facilities, which may not be possible at all or under commercially reasonable terms. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Credit Facilities and our additional available borrowings under the Credit Facilities were approximately $96.0 million in the aggregate based upon the outstanding borrowings and maximum facility amounts.\nAdditionally, the replacement of LIBOR could materially adversely affect our revenue or expenses and the value of our assets or obligations. U.S. LIBOR ceased to be published on June 30, 2023 as a result of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In May 2018, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the Secured Overnight Finance Rate (SOFR) as an alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the \"U.S. Treasury\") securities, given the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market.\nThe Credit Facilities were previously amended such that the interest rate applied to the loans are no longer calculated using LIBOR but instead calculated using SOFR (as further described in the Credit Facilities). SOFR will fluctuate with changing market conditions and, as SOFR increases, our interest expense will mechanically increase. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, including the conversion of our LIBOR-based loans to SOFR, is complex and could have a range of material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:\nadversely affect the interest rates paid, and the expenses associated with, our obligations, loans and other financial instruments tied to LIBOR rates, due to the significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR;\nresult in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language contained in the Inventory Financing Facility; and/or\nrequire the transition to or development of appropriate systems to effectively transition from LIBOR-based loans to those based on SOFR or another applicable alternative pricing benchmark.\nSimilarly, decreases in the availability of credit and increases in the cost of credit could adversely affect the ability of our customers to purchase boats from us and thereby adversely affect our ability to sell our products and impact the profitability of our finance & insurance activities. For example, tight credit conditions during each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year 2008 and continuing through fiscal year 2011 adversely affected the ability of customers to finance boat purchases, which had a negative effect on our operating results.\nIncreases in fuel prices may adversely affect our business.\nAll of the recreational boats we sell are powered by gasoline or diesel engines. Consequently, a significant increase in the price or tax on the sale of fuel on a regional or national basis could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results. Increases in fuel prices (such as those that occurred during 2008) may negatively impact boat sales. The price of or tax on fuels may significantly increase in the future, adversely affecting our business.\nThe availability of boat insurance is critical to our success.\nThe ability of our customers to secure reasonably affordable boat insurance that is satisfactory to lenders that finance our customers purchases is critical to our success. Historically, affordable boat insurance has been available. However, as a severe storm approaches land, insurance providers cease underwriting until the storm passes. This loss of insurance prevents or delays lenders from lending. As a result, sales of boats can be temporarily halted making our revenue difficult to predict and causing sales to be delayed or potentially cancelled. Any difficulty of customers to obtain affordable boat insurance could impede boat sales and adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect consumer demand and to anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends, or the lack or excess of inventory in the industry, generally, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to procure sufficient inventory for our needs and to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to product trends and consumer demands in a timely manner. Our products appeal to consumers across a number of states who are, or could become, boat owners. The preferences of these consumers cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Further, the retail consumer industry, by its nature, is volatile and sensitive to numerous economic factors, including consumer preferences, competition, market conditions, general economic conditions and other factors outside of our control. For example, the impact of the novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") on our suppliers and subsequent increase in demand for marine retail products led to industry-wide supply chain constraints. We experienced inventory shortages in marine retail products in fiscal year 2021, and it is possible that further shortages could occur. We cannot predict consumer preferences with certainty, and consumer preferences often change over time. We typically order product several months in advance, although such orders are not binding until the merchandise is delivered to our locations. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends, increases or decreases in consumer demand or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our products or our consumers purchasing habits in the future, our revenues may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of product to satisfy consumer demand or sales orders or we may be required to discount excess inventory, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our ability to attract and retain customers.\nOur future success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain customers for our boat sales, repair and maintenance services, parts and accessories and finance & insurance products. The extent to which we achieve growth in our customer base and retain existing customers materially influences our profitability. Any number of factors could affect our ability to grow and maintain our customer base. These factors include consumer preferences, the frequency with which customers utilize our products, repair and maintenance services and finance & insurance products, general economic conditions, our ability to maintain our dealership locations, weather conditions, the availability of alternative services, protection plans, products and resources, significant increases in gasoline prices, the disposable income of consumers available for discretionary expenditures and the external perception of our brands. Any significant decline in our customer base, or the usage of our services, protection plans or products by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on income from financing, insurance and extended service contracts.\nA portion of our income results from referral fees derived from the placement or marketing of various finance & insurance products, consisting of customer financing, insurance products and extended service contracts, the most significant component of which is the participation and other fees resulting from our sale of customer financing contracts.\nThe availability of financing for our boat purchasers and the level of participation and other fees we receive in connection with such financing depend on the particular agreement between us and the lender and the current interest rate environment. Lenders may impose terms in their boat financing arrangements with us that may be unfavorable to us or our customers, resulting in reduced demand for our customer financing programs and lower participation and other fees. Laws or regulations may be enacted nationally or locally which could result in fees from lenders being eliminated or reduced, materially impacting our operating results. If customer financing becomes more difficult to secure, it may adversely impact our business.\nChanges, including the lengthening of manufacturer warranties, may reduce our ability to offer and sell extended service contracts which may have a material adverse impact on our ability to sell finance and insurance products. Moreover, these products are subject to complex federal and state laws and regulations. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered will not seek to regulate or restrict these products. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in fines or other penalties including orders by state regulators to discontinue sales of the warranty products in one or more jurisdictions. Such a result could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) established a consumer financial protection bureau with broad regulatory powers. Although boat dealers are generally excluded, the Dodd-Frank Act could lead to additional, indirect regulation of boat dealers through its regulation of other financial institutions which provide such financing to our customers.\nIf interest rates rise, or continue to rise, the fees we receive in connection with the financing may be limited or reduced as customers become more interest rate sensitive and the spreads that we are able to charge are compressed. The reduction of profit margins on sales of finance & insurance products or the lack of demand for or the unavailability of these products could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins.\nOur operations are dependent upon key personnel and team members.\nOur success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract, train, and retain qualified team members and executive officers, as well as the continuing efforts and abilities of team members and executive officers. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and management succession plans, we cannot ensure that these or other executive personnel and team members will remain with us, or that our succession planning will adequately mitigate the risk associated with key personnel transitions. Expanding our operations may require us to add additional executive personnel and team members in the future. As a result of our decentralized operating strategy, we also rely on the management teams of our marine retailers. In addition, we likely will depend on the senior management of any significant businesses we acquire in the future. The loss of the services of one or more key employees before we are able to attract and retain qualified replacement personnel could adversely affect our business. Additionally, our ability to manage our personnel costs and operating expenses is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, healthcare and other benefit costs, changing demographics and our reputation and relevance within the labor markets where we are located. Increases in the prevailing wage rates due to competitive market pressures or other factors could increase our personnel costs and operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe products we sell or service may expose us to potential liability for personal injury, product liability or property damage claims relating to the use of those products.\nManufacturers of the products we sell generally maintain product liability insurance. We maintain third-party liability insurance with respect to the sale and servicing of boats and other watercrafts along with limited product liability insurance. We may therefore experience claims that are not covered by our insurance coverage. While we have not experienced material losses related to product liability, personal injury or property damage claims in the past, we could be exposed to such claims or losses in the future. The institution of any significant claims against us could subject us to damages, result in higher insurance costs and harm our business reputation with potential customers.\nIf we cannot dispose of pre-owned boats acquired through our trade-in or direct purchase processes at prices that allow us to recover its costs, our profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe resale values of any pre-owned boats that we acquire through trade-ins or direct purchase may be lower than our estimates, which are based on expected retail sales prices. If the resale value of the pre-owned boats we acquire is lower than our estimates and/or we are not able to resell them timely or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, certain pre-owned boats or other vehicles that we acquire through trade-ins may fail to meet our retail quality standards. Instead, we sell these units through a wholesale process. If the prices that we receive for our pre-owned boats sold in this process are not sufficient to cover the prices paid or credit given at trade-in for such pre-owned boats, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur sales of boats and other products produced by certain foreign manufacturers expose us to international political, economic, and other risks.\nOur sales of products produced in Italy, France, Australia, China and the United Kingdom, as well as any other non-U.S. manufacturer whose products we may sell, expose us to international political, economic and other risks. We also import certain boat components from international suppliers which could further our exposure to such international risks. Protectionist trade legislation in the United States, the European Union, and other countries, such as changes in current tariff structures, export or import compliance laws, or other trade policies could adversely affect our ability to import boats or boat components from these foreign suppliers under economically favorable terms and conditions.\nThere have been recent changes, and future, additional changes may occur, to United States and foreign trade and tax policies, including heightened import restrictions, import and export licenses, new tariffs, trade embargoes, government sanctions or trade barriers. Any of these restrictions could prevent or make it difficult or more costly for us to import boats and boat components from foreign suppliers under economically favorable terms and conditions. Increased tariffs could require us to increase our prices which likely could decrease demand for our products. In addition, other countries may limit their trade with the United States or retaliate through their own restrictions and/or increased tariffs which would affect our ability to export products and therefore adversely affect our sales.\nOur foreign purchase of boats and boat components creates a number of logistical and communications challenges. The economic, political and other risks we face resulting from these foreign purchases include the following:\ncompliance with U.S. and local laws and regulatory requirements as well as changes in those laws and requirements;\ntransportation delays or interruptions and other effects of less developed infrastructures;\nlimitations on imports and exports;\nforeign exchange rate fluctuations;\nimposition of restrictions on currency conversion or the transfer of funds;\nmaintenance of quality standards;\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\ndiffering labor regulations;\npotentially adverse tax consequences;\npossible employee turnover or labor unrest;\nthe burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws; and\npolitical or economic conflicts, instability or civil unrest.\nWe have established online marketplaces and a failure in such online operations, security breaches and cybersecurity risks could disrupt our business and lead to reduced sales and growth prospects and reputational damage.\nConsumers are increasingly embracing shopping online and through mobile commerce applications. However, consumer preferences and e-commerce buying trends could change, and we may be vulnerable to additional risks and uncertainties associated with online sales, including rapid changes in technology, website downtime and other technical failures, security breaches, cyber-attacks, consumer privacy concerns, changes in state tax regimes and government regulation of internet activities. Online marketplaces may also increase our access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that is subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our online sales, increase our costs, diminish our growth prospects, damage our brands, and subject us to regulatory fines or investigations, which could negatively impact our operations and stock price. In addition, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully expand our online platforms. Our competitors may have e-commerce businesses that are substantially larger and more developed than ours, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage. If we are unable to expand our online platforms, our growth plans could suffer, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may be unable to adequately maintain, enforce, and protect our intellectual property rights and we may be accused of infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operations.\nWe continue to use a number of legacy trade names in connection with marine retailers that we have acquired, which we have not re-branded under our OneWater mark, including Star brite\u00ae and Star Tron\u00ae. In addition, we own patents that provide some competitive support for our Performacide\u00ae products. If any of our or the marine retailers trademarks become generic, or if third parties adopt marks similar to such marks, we may need to devote additional resources to advertising and marketing.\nDespite our best efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other third parties may attempt to unlawfully copy, obtain or otherwise use our trade names, trademarks, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary information without our consent. We take commercially reasonable measures designed to identify and protect our intellectual property. However, monitoring unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult and costly, and the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to effectively prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating, diluting or otherwise violating our intellectual property rights. From time to time, we may be compelled to protect our intellectual property, which may involve litigation. Such litigation may be time-consuming and expensive and could result in the impairment or loss of the involved intellectual property. There is no guarantee that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property, including litigation, when necessary, will be successful.\nWe cannot assure that our intellectual property rights will be effectively utilized, maintained, or, if necessary, successfully enforced against third parties. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own intellectual property rights, or, where appropriate, license from others intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights, and any additional rights we may obtain in the future, may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged, and the legal costs necessary to protect our intellectual property rights could be significant. Our failure to obtain registered intellectual property rights, or maintain or successfully assert intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may also be subject to infringement, misappropriation, dilution, or other violation complaints from others asserting our use of intellectual property rights owned or alleged to be owned by third parties. Litigation related to such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in injunctions against us or the payment of damages. Even if intellectual property claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert our resources and require significant expenditures. Any of the foregoing could prevent us from competing effectively and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial condition.\nChanges in the assumptions used to calculate our acquisition related contingent consideration liabilities could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nSome of our acquisitions have included, and future acquisitions may include, contingent consideration liabilities relating to payments based on the future performance of the operations acquired. Under generally accepted accounting principles, we are required to estimate the fair value of any contingent consideration. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are uncertain and involve significant judgments. Changes in business conditions or other events could materially change the projection of future earnings used in the fair value calculations of contingent consideration liabilities. We reassess the fair value quarterly, and increases or decreases based on the actual or expected future performance of the acquired operations will be recorded in our results of operations. These quarterly adjustments could have a material effect on our results of operations.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of long-lived assets, goodwill and identifiable intangible assets could negatively impact our financial results and net worth.\nOur long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, are required to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. As of September 30, 2023, we have approximately $81.5 million of property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value. Estimates of expected future cash flows represent our best estimate based on currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require us to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate expected future cash flows.\nAdditionally, our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding industry conditions, our future financial performance, and other factors. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a non-cash intangible asset impairment of $147.4 million. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. While we do not believe there is currently a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the judgments and assumptions used in our assessments of goodwill and long-lived assets which would result in any further material effect on our operating results, we cannot predict whether events or circumstances will change in the future that could result in non-cash impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results and net worth.\nOur Dealership same-store sales may fluctuate and may not be a meaningful indicator of future performance.\nOur Dealership same-store sales may vary from quarter to quarter. A number of factors have historically affected, and will continue to affect, our Dealership same-store sales results, including:\nchanges or anticipated changes to regulations related to some of the products we sell;\nconsumer preferences, buying trends and overall economic trends;\nour ability to identify and respond effectively to local and regional trends and customer preferences;\nour ability to provide quality customer service that will increase our conversion of shoppers into paying customers;\ncompetition in the regional market of a dealership;\natypical weather patterns;\nchanges in our product availability and mix;\nchanges in sales of services; and\nchanges in pricing and average unit sales.\nAn unanticipated decline in revenues or Dealership same-store sales may cause the price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate significantly.\nWe primarily lease our locations. If we are unable to maintain those leases or locate alternative sites for our locations in our target markets and on terms that are acceptable to us, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe currently lease 106 of the real properties where we conduct operations. Most locations operate under long-term leases with an initial term of at least 10 years and one or more renewal options for an additional 5 to 10 years. Additionally, we have entered into location leases with certain related parties for which we incurred $2.1 million in lease expense in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing locations as leases expire, extend the leases or be able to locate alternative sites in our target markets and on favorable terms. Any failure to maintain our existing locations, extend the leases or locate alternative sites on favorable or acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nBecause we use various materials and substances in manufacturing our chemical products, our production facilities are subject to operating hazards that could cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment.\nWe are dependent on the continued operation of our Kinpak facility to blend various chemicals. This facility is subject to hazards associated with the manufacture, handling, storage and transportation of chemical materials and products, including natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, labor difficulties, transportation interruptions, and environmental hazards, such as spills, discharges or release of toxic or hazardous substances and remediation complications. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to, or destruction of, property and equipment and business interruption and could adversely affect our financial condition.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Geographic Factors\nClimatic events may adversely impact our operations, disrupt the business of our third party vendors on whom we rely upon for products and services, and may not be adequately covered by our insurance.\nClimatic events in the areas where we operate have caused, and future climatic events may cause, disruptions and in some cases delays or suspensions in our operations that adversely impacted our business. For example, the physical effects of unseasonably wet weather, extended periods of below freezing weather, tropical storms, hurricanes or other natural disasters occurring on land or in the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean may force boating areas to close or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, which could result in curtailment of customer demand for our products and services. Similarly, drought conditions arising from minimal or reduced rainfall events may have a similar effect in respect of the availability of boating areas or usable dock space, and result in reduced interest in boating activities. One or more of these climatic events has in the past and may in the future result in physical damage to, or closure of, one or more of our facilities, inadequate work force in our markets, and disruption or reduction in the availability of products at our locations. Concerns regarding global changes in climate could also adversely affect the levels of boat purchases. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to shorter selling seasons in certain locations. Many of our dealerships sell boats to customers for use on reservoirs, which could be subject to reduced capacity as a result of drought, extreme temperatures, or other climatic changes, thereby subjecting our business to the continued viability of these reservoirs for boating use.\nIn addition, the physical effects of climatic events, including wintry conditions, increased frequency and severity of tropical storms or hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters, as well as sea level rise, could result in the disruption of our operations and/or third party supply chain vendors on whom we rely upon for products and services, including boat deliveries from manufacturers, or damage to or the loss of our boat inventories and facilities as has been the case when the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions and other markets have been affected by hurricanes. Such disruptions in our supply chain could damage our on-site inventory at our locations or cause serious limitations or delays in the operations of our locations. We maintain hurricane and casualty insurance, subject to deductibles. Our planning for normal climatic variation, insurance programs and emergency recovery plans may inadequately mitigate the effects of such climatic conditions, and not all such effects can be predicted, eliminated, mitigated, or insured against. Accordingly, while we traditionally maintain property and casualty insurance coverage for damage caused by climatic events such as severe weather or other natural disasters, there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage is adequate to cover losses that we may sustain as a result thereof.\nA significant amount of our boat sales are from the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions.\nEconomic conditions, weather and environmental conditions, competition, market conditions and any other adverse conditions impacting the Southeast and Gulf Coast regions of the United States, in which we generated approximately 81%, 79% and 80% of our revenue during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, could have a major impact on our operations.\nEnvironmental and other regulatory issues impact our operations from time to time.\nOur operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations governing such matters as finance & insurance, consumer protection, consumer privacy, escheatment, anti-money laundering, releases, discharges and emissions or other releases into the environment and environmental protection, human health and safety, and employment practices, including wage and hour and anti-discrimination legal requirements. These laws and regulations affect many aspects of our operations, such as requiring the acquisition and renewal of permits, licenses and other governmental approvals to conduct regulated activities, including the retail sale of recreational boats, restricting the manner in which we use, handle, store, recycle, transport and dispose of discarded substances and wastes, responding to and performing investigatory, remedial and corrective actions with respect to any discharges and emissions or other release of regulated substances, requiring capital and operating expenditures to construct, maintain and upgrade pollution control and containment equipment and facilities, imposing specific human health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, and imposing liabilities for failure to comply with applicable environmental or other legal requirements, pollution incidents or inappropriate payment or treatment of our workers with respect to our operations. The failure to satisfy those and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, failure to comply with those and other legal requirements, or with U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable laws or regulations could result in the assessment of damages, the imposition of sanctions including monetary penalties, changes to our processes, or a delay, suspension or cessation of our operations, as well as damage to our image and reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nNumerous governmental agencies, including OSHA, the EPA and similar federal agencies as well as analogous state and local agencies regulate and maintain enforcement authority over the operation of our locations, repair facilities, and other operations, with respect to matters such as consumer protection, human safety and environmental protection, including any contamination of or releases into ambient air, surficial and subsurface soils, surface water and groundwater. Marine engine manufacturers are subject to emissions standards imposed under the CAA, and the EPA has enacted a number of legal requirements imposing more stringent emissions standards for two-cycle, gasoline outboard marine engines. It is possible that regulatory bodies such as the EPA may impose more stringent emissions standards in the future for marine engines, including with respect to recreational use. Any increased costs of those manufacturers producing engines resulting from current or future EPA standards could be passed on to dealers in the retail recreational boat industry, such as ourselves, or could result in the inability of, or potential unforeseen delays by, these manufacturers to manufacture and make timely delivery of recreational boats to such dealers, which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that would be able to pass any such increased costs on to our customers, and such increased costs could deter customer interest and otherwise adversely affect boating sales.\nAs with companies in the marine retail industry generally, and parts and service operations in particular, our business involves the use, handling, storage, transportation and contracting for recycling or disposal of waste materials, including hazardous or toxic substances and wastes as well as environmentally sensitive materials, such as motor oil, waste motor oil and filters, transmission fluid, antifreeze, freon, waste paint and lacquer thinner, batteries, solvents, lubricants, degreasing agents, gasoline, and diesel fuels. Laws and regulations regarding the prevention of pollution or remediation of environmental contamination generally apply regardless of whether we lease or purchase the land and facilities. Additionally, certain of our locations and/or repair facilities utilize USTs and ASTs, primarily for storing and dispensing petroleum-based products. Storage tanks in the United States are generally subject to financial responsibility requirements and testing, containment, upgrading and removal requirements under the RCRA, and its state law counterparts, as well as federal, state and local legal standards relating to investigation and remediation of contaminated soils, surface water and groundwater resulting from leaking tanks and associated inground lifts. We also may be subject to civil liability to third parties for remediation costs or other damages if our owned or operated tanks leak or leakage migrates onto the property of others.\nWe are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local authorities establishing investigatory, remedial, human health and environmental quality standards and imposing liability related thereto, which liabilities may include sanctions, including monetary penalties for violations of those standards. Certain of our locations and/or repair facility properties have been operated in the past by third parties whose use, handling and disposal of petroleum-based products or wastes were not under our control. Given the strict liability nature of environmental laws, we may be liable for the remediation of such past releases notwithstanding that our operations did not cause or contribute to the contamination.\nWe also are subject to laws, ordinances, and regulations governing investigation and remediation of contamination at facilities we operate or to which we send hazardous or toxic substances or wastes for treatment, recycling, or disposal. In particular, CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose strict joint and several liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur.\nA majority of states have adopted Superfund laws comparable to and, in some cases, more stringent than CERCLA. If we were to be found to be a responsible party under CERCLA or a similar state statute, we could be held liable for all investigative and remedial costs associated with addressing such contamination as well as for natural resource damages. In addition, claims alleging personal injury or property damage may be brought against us as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances resulting from our operations. Moreover, certain of our locations are located on waterways that are subject to federal laws, including the Clean Water Act and the OPA, as well as analogous state laws regulating navigable waters, oil pollution (including prevention and cleanup of the same), adverse impacts to fish and wildlife, and other matters. For example, under the OPA, owners and operators of vessels and onshore facilities may be subject to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States.\nWe could be required to conduct remediation in the future in accordance with applicable state and federal standards in the cleanup of petroleum hydrocarbons or other substances or wastes released on, under or from properties owned or leased by us, including some of our properties that were previously used as gasoline service stations. For example, we are performing soil and groundwater monitoring activities as required by applicable state and federal standards. We may also be required in the future to remove USTs, ASTs and inground lifts containing petroleum-based products and hazardous or toxic substances or wastes should they represent a risk of release or threatened release into the environment. Historically, our costs of compliance with these investigatory, remedial and monitoring requirements have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition. We also may have additional storage tank liability insurance and other insurance coverage with respect to pollution-related liabilities where available, but such coverages may be insufficient to address such liabilities. Environmental laws and regulations are comprehensive and subject to frequent change. Compliance with amended, new, or more stringent laws or regulations, more strict interpretations of existing laws, or the future discovery of environmental conditions may require additional expenditures by us, and such expenditures may be material.\nAdditionally, certain states have imposed legal requirements or are considering the imposition of such requirements that would obligate buyers and/or operators of recreational boats to obtain a license in order to operate such boats. These requirements could discourage potential buyers of recreational boats, thereby limiting future sales and adversely affecting our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurthermore, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act increased our annual employee health care costs that we fund, and significantly increased our cost of compliance and compliance risk related to offering health care benefits.\nMoreover, adverse changes in labor policy could lead to increased unionization efforts, which could lead to higher labor costs, disrupt our locations operations, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations are subject to risks arising out of the threat of climate change, which could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products that we and the retail recreational boat industry provide.\nThe threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the United States and foreign countries. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of GHGs and eliminate future GHG emissions. Governmental and public concern arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing regulatory, political, financial and litigation risks in the United States and globally that target predominantly fossil fuel-related energy entities or their operations, which may have indirect adverse effects on other companies or industries, such as the retail recreational boat industry, for example, whose services or products generate GHGs or rely upon motor fuels refined from fossil fuels, which effects could be material.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive federal climate change legislation has been implemented. With the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, implement standards reducing emissions of methane, a form of GHG, from specified oil and gas sectors, and together with the U.S. Department of Transportation, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States. While these rules largely do not directly impact our operations, they do represent a concerted effort at the federal level to reduce emissions of GHGs in an effort to mitigate adverse effects associated with climate change. Additionally, in August 2022 the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 was signed into law, which appropriates significant federal funding for renewable energy initiatives and, for the first time ever, imposes a fee on GHG emissions from certain facilities in the oil and natural gas sector. The emissions fee and renewable and low carbon energy funding provisions of the law could accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels or otherwise adversely impact the production of marine motor fuels, which could in turn have an indirect adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Under the Biden Administration, it is anticipated that efforts by the EPA or other federal agencies to restrict GHG emissions will continue. Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, there exists the United Nations-sponsored Paris Agreement, which requires nations to submit non-binding GHG emissions reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden announced in April 2021 a new, more rigorous nationally determined emissions reduction level of 50-52% reduction from 2005 levels in economy-wide net GHG emissions by 2030. The international community gathered again in Glasgow in November 2021 at the 26th Conference to the Parties (COP26), during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced at COP26 the launch of the Global Methane Pledge, an initiative committing to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 percent from 2020 levels by 2030. As a result, there exists the possibility of executive orders being issued or federal legislation or regulatory initiatives being adopted that could result in further restrictions on fossil fuels and have a further indirect adverse effect on the demand for our and the retail recreational boat industry products.\nLitigation risks, including lawsuits against fossil-fuel energy companies arising from the production and use of fossil fuels that contribute to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, erosion and damage to existing physical infrastructure, and financial risks for such entities as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors further exacerbate the potential for these indirect adverse effects. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative clean energy sources such as wind and solar photovoltaic could also reduce demand for fossil fuels and therefore for our boating products, which would lead to a reduction in our revenues. For example, at COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. The various suballiances of GFANZ generally require participants to set short-term, sector-specific targets to transition their financing, investing, and/or underwriting activities to net zero by 2050.\nThere is also the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding for companies producing, developing or bolstering the use of fossil fuels. Increasing attention to climate change, investor and societal expectations regarding voluntary Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) disclosures and consumer demand for alternative forms of energy may result in demand shifts for fossil-fuel products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation against such companies. While we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be representative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Moreover, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings and recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with fossil fuel-related assets could lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other, non-fossil fuel markets, which could have a negative impact on our access to and costs of capital.\nIncreasingly, various jurisdictions are considering or implementing increased disclosure data for companies related to climate change and GHG emissions. In March of 2022, the SEC released a proposed rule that would establish a framework for reporting of climate risks, targets, and metrics. The final rule has not yet been released and we cannot predict what any such rule may require. To the extent the final rule imposes additional reporting obligations, we could incur increased costs, particularly as it relates to the requirement to collect and disclose data on physical climate-related risks. Further, in October 2023 California passed climate disclosure laws that, among other requirements, will require public and private companies that do business in California with total annual revenues exceeding certain thresholds to make disclosures including GHG emission data and climate-related financial risks. The implementing regulations for the law have not yet been drafted and the requirements are currently set to begin taking effect in 2026, with additional requirements phasing in through 2030. While we are still assessing the impact of these requirements, additional reporting obligations could cause us to incur increased costs.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nOneWater Inc. is a holding company. OneWater Inc.s only material asset is its equity interest in OneWater LLC directly or indirectly through its equity ownership in other wholly owned subsidiaries, and OneWater Inc. is accordingly dependent upon distributions from OneWater LLC to pay taxes, make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement and cover OneWater Inc.s corporate and other overhead expenses.\nOneWater Inc. is a holding company and has no material assets other than its equity interest in OneWater LLC which it holds directly and through other direct and/or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries. OneWater Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent OneWater LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt instruments, the OneWater LLC Agreement requires OneWater LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to OneWater Unit Holders, including OneWater Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow OneWater Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We generally expect OneWater LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash and in the event that payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are accelerated, where applicable, we generally expect to fund such accelerated payment out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration. When OneWater LLC makes distributions, the OneWater Unit Holders are entitled to receive proportionate distributions based on their interests in OneWater LLC at the time of such distribution. In addition, the OneWater LLC Agreement requires OneWater LLC to make non-pro rata payments to OneWater Inc. to reimburse it for its corporate and other overhead expenses, which payments are not treated as distributions under the OneWater LLC Agreement. To the extent that OneWater Inc. needs funds and OneWater LLC or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions or payments under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of any current or future financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nMoreover, because OneWater Inc. has no independent means of generating revenue, OneWater Inc.s ability to make tax payments and payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is dependent on the ability of OneWater LLC to make distributions to OneWater Inc. and/or its direct and/or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are OneWater Unit Holders in an amount sufficient to cover OneWater Inc.s tax obligations and obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. This ability, in turn, may depend on the ability of OneWater LLCs subsidiaries to make distributions to it and of OneWater Inc.'s direct and/or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are OneWater Unit Holders ability to make ultimate distributions to OneWater Marine Inc. The ability of OneWater Inc.'s direct and/or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are OneWater Unit Holders and/or OneWater LLC, its subsidiaries and other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest to make such distributions is subject to, among other things, (i) the applicable provisions of Delaware law (or other applicable jurisdiction) that may limit the amount of funds available for distribution and (ii) restrictions in relevant debt instruments issued by OneWater Inc.'s direct and/or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are OneWater Unit Holders or OneWater LLC or its subsidiaries and other entities in which it directly or indirectly holds an equity interest. To the extent that OneWater Inc. is unable to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for any reason, such payments will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid.\nThe requirements of being a public company, including compliance with the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, and the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act), may strain our resources, increase our costs and distract management, and we may be unable to comply with these requirements in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nAs a public company, we are required to comply with laws, regulations and requirements, certain corporate governance provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, related regulations of the SEC and the requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq), with which we were not required to comply as a private company. Complying with these statutes, regulations and requirements occupies a significant amount of time of our Board of Directors and management and significantly increases our costs and expenses. We are required to:\nmaintain a comprehensive compliance function;\ncomply with rules promulgated by Nasdaq;\nprepare and distribute periodic public reports in compliance with our obligations under the federal securities laws;\naccurately implement and interpret U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);\ncomply with certain internal policies, such as those relating to insider trading; and\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the above activities.\nAs a public company, we are also required to comply with the SECs rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. We are required to have our auditors formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (Section 404). Our compliance with Section 404 necessitates that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts.\nIn addition, we expect that being a public company subject to these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our Board of Directors or as executive officers.\nIf we experience any material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to develop or maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our Class A common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. As a result of being a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. We continue to take additional steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented, and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting during the evaluation and testing process or we are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, we may be unable to conclude that our internal controls are effective. For additional information, please see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Internal Controls and Procedures.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If in the future we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our disclosure controls or our internal controls over financial reporting in the future.\nAn active, liquid and orderly trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop or be maintained, and our stock price may be volatile.\nAlthough our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq, we do not know how liquid that market might be at any point in time. You may not be able to resell your Class A common stock at or above the price at which you purchased it. Additionally, lack of liquidity may result in wide bid-ask spreads, contribute to significant fluctuations and volatility in the market price of the Class A common stock and limit the number of investors who are able to buy the Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. In the event of a drop in the market price of our Class A common stock, you could lose a substantial part or all of your investment in our Class A common stock. You may not be able to sell shares of our Class A common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price paid by you.\nThe following factors could affect our stock price:\nquarterly variations in our financial and operating results;\nthe public reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\nstrategic actions by our competitors or suppliers;\nchanges in revenue, Dealership same-store sales or earnings estimates, or changes in recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage, by equity research analysts;\nacquisitions or integration of acquired marine retailers or other businesses;\nthe failure of our operating results to meet the expectations of equity research analysts and investors;\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\nthe failure of research analysts to continue to cover our Class A common stock;\nsales of our Class A common stock by us or other stockholders, or the perception that such sales may occur;\nchanges in accounting principles, policies, guidance, interpretations or standards;\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\nactions by our stockholders;\ngeneral market conditions, including fluctuations in commodity prices;\nthe publication of boating industry sales data or new boat registration data;\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance; and\nthe realization of any risks described under this Risk Factors section.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. For some companies this volatility was exacerbated by the continued wide ranging impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock. Securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a companys securities. Such litigation, if instituted against us, could result in very substantial costs, divert our managements attention and resources and materially harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur Legacy Owners own a significant amount of our voting stock, and their interests may conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nThe Legacy Owners own a significant amount of our voting stock. As a result, the Legacy Owners may be able to substantially influence matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, approval of any potential acquisition of us, changes to our organizational documents and significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership makes it unlikely that any other holder or group of holders of our Class A common stock will be able to affect the way we are managed or the direction of our business. The interests of the Legacy Owners with respect to matters potentially or actually involving or affecting us, such as future acquisitions, financings and other corporate opportunities and attempts to acquire us, may conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFor example, the Legacy Owners may have different tax positions from us, especially in light of the Tax Receivable Agreement, that could influence their decisions regarding whether and when to support the disposition of assets, the incurrence or refinancing of new or existing indebtedness, or the termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement and acceleration of our obligations thereunder. In addition, the determination of future tax reporting positions, the structuring of future transactions and the handling of any challenge by any taxing authority to our tax reporting positions may take into consideration the Legacy Owners tax or other considerations which may differ from the considerations of us or our other stockholders. Please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement in this Form 10-K.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, entities that may compete with us in seeking business opportunities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in allocating time or pursuing business opportunities.\nCertain of our executive officers and directors, who are responsible for managing the direction of our operations, hold positions of responsibility with other entities (including affiliated entities) that are in the retail boating industry. These executive officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities that may be appropriate for presentation to us as well as to the other entities with which they are or may become affiliated. Due to these existing and potential future affiliations, they may present potential business opportunities to other entities prior to presenting them to us, which could cause additional conflicts of interest. They may also decide that certain opportunities are more appropriate for other entities with which they are affiliated, and as a result, they may elect not to present those opportunities to us. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware law, contain provisions that could discourage acquisition bids or merger proposals, which may adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock and could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval in one or more series, designate the number of shares constituting any series, and fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. If our Board of Directors elects to issue preferred stock, it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire us. In addition, some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us, even if the change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders. These provisions include:\nproviding that all vacancies, including newly created directorships, may, except as otherwise required by law or, if applicable, the rights of holders of a series of preferred stock, only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\npermitting any action by stockholders to be taken only at an annual meeting or special meeting rather than by a written consent of the stockholders, subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock with respect to such rights;\npermitting special meetings of our stockholders to be called only by our Chief Executive Officer, the chairman of our Board of Directors and our Board of Directors pursuant to a resolution adopted by the affirmative vote of a majority of the total number of authorized directors whether or not there exist any vacancies in previously authorized directorships;\nsubject to the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock, requiring the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority in voting power of all then outstanding common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, to remove any of all of the directors from office at any time;\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\nestablishing advance notice provisions for stockholder proposals and nominations for elections to the Board of Directors to be acted upon at meetings of stockholders; and\nproviding that the Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, or to alter or repeal our bylaws.\nIn addition, certain change of control events have the effect of accelerating the payment due under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be substantial and accordingly serve as a disincentive to a potential acquirer of our company. Please see -In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders and our bylaws designate the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of causes of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933. These designations could limit our stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director or officer or other employee of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each such case subject to such Court of Chancery having personal jurisdiction over the indispensable parties named as defendants therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act, the Securities Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Further, our bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Although our bylaws provide for an exclusive forum for causes of action under the Securities Act, its stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock will be deemed to have notice of, and consented to, the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws described herein. These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and such persons. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile the Board of Directors declared a one-time special cash dividend of $1.80 per share on June 17, 2021, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and our Credit Facilities place certain restrictions on our ability to do so. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our Class A common stock appreciates.\nWe do not plan to declare cash dividends on shares of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. Additionally, the Credit Facilities place certain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Any future credit agreements or financing arrangements may also contain restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity, while such dividend restrictions remain in place, to achieve a return on your investment in us may be to sell your Class A common stock at a price greater than you paid for it. There is no guarantee that the price of our Class A common stock that will prevail in the market will ever exceed the price that you paid.\nFuture sales or issuances of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales or issuances may occur, could reduce our stock price, and any additional capital raised by us through the sale or issuance of equity or convertible securities may dilute your ownership in us.\nWe may sell additional shares of Class A common stock in subsequent public offerings. We may also issue additional shares of Class A common stock or convertible securities. We have 14,539,056 outstanding shares of Class A common stock and 1,429,940 outstanding shares of Class B common stock as of November 28, 2023. Certain OneWater Unit Holders are party to a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement), which requires us to effect the registration of any shares of Class A common stock that they receive in exchange for their OneWater LLC Units in certain circumstances.\nOn February 11, 2020, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of 1,600,533 shares of our Class A common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our long term incentive plan (the LTIP). On May 7, 2021, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 providing for the registration of (i) an additional 46,750 shares of Class A common stock that may be delivered with respect to awards under the LTIP pursuant to an evergreen provision contained in the LTIP and (ii) an indeterminate amount of interests to be offered or sold pursuant to the OneWater Marine Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Subject to the satisfaction of vesting conditions, the expiration of lock-up agreements and the requirements of Rule 144, shares registered under each of the registration statements on Form S-8 may be made available for resale immediately in the public market without restriction.\nOn September 7, 2021, we filed a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-3 providing for the registration of (i) an indeterminate number of shares of Class A common stock to be offered, on a primary basis, at indeterminate prices with an aggregate initial offering price not to exceed $250,000,000 and (ii) 375,000 shares of Class A common stock that may be sold in one or more secondary offerings by the selling stockholders named therein.\nOn July 1, 2022, the first offering period began under the 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP). The ESPP provides for a maximum issuance of 449,257 shares of Class A common stock, subject to certain adjustments set forth in the ESPP.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or securities convertible into Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of shares of our Class A common stock will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices of our Class A common stock.\nOneWater Inc. is required to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement for certain tax benefits that it may claim, and the amounts of such payments could be significant.\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by OneWater Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using simplifying assumptions to address the impact of state and local taxes) that OneWater Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result of certain increases in tax basis available to OneWater Inc. as a result of the exercise of the Redemption Right or pursuant to our Call Right or that relate to prior transfers of such OneWater LLC Units that will be available to OneWater Inc. as a result of its acquisition of those units, and certain benefits attributable to imputed interest. OneWater Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining net cash savings.\nThe terms of the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced upon completion of the IPO and will continue until all tax benefits that are subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement have been utilized or expired, unless OneWater Inc. exercises its right to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement (or the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated due to other circumstances, including OneWater Inc.s breach of a material obligation thereunder or certain mergers or other changes of control), and OneWater Inc. makes the termination payment specified in the Tax Receivable Agreement. In addition, payments OneWater Inc. makes under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be increased by any interest accrued from the due date (without extensions) of the corresponding tax return. Payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement commenced in 2022 and, in the event that the Tax Receivable Agreement is not terminated, are anticipated to continue until after the date of the last redemption of the OneWater LLC Units.\nThe payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are OneWater Inc.s obligations and not obligations of OneWater LLC, and we expect that the payments OneWater Inc. will be required to make under the Tax Receivable Agreement will be substantial. Estimating the amount and timing of OneWater Inc.s realization of tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement is by its nature imprecise. The actual increases in tax basis covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as the amount and timing of OneWater Inc.s ability to use any deductions (or decreases in gain or increases in loss) arising from such increases in tax basis, are dependent upon significant future events, including but not limited to the timing of the redemptions of OneWater LLC Units, the price of OneWater Inc.s Class A common stock at the time of each redemption, the extent to which such redemptions are taxable transactions, the amount of the redeeming unit holders tax basis in its OneWater LLC Units at the time of the relevant redemption, the depreciation and amortization periods that apply to the increase in tax basis, the amount, character, and timing of taxable income OneWater Inc. generates in the future, the timing and amount of any earlier payments that OneWater Inc. may have made under the Tax Receivable Agreement, the U.S. federal income tax rate then applicable, and the portion of OneWater Inc.s payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement that constitute imputed interest or give rise to depreciable or amortizable tax basis. Accordingly, estimating the amount and timing of payments that may become due under the Tax Receivable Agreement is also by its nature imprecise. For purposes of the Tax Receivable Agreement, net cash savings in tax generally are calculated by comparing OneWater Inc.s actual tax liability (determined by using the actual applicable U.S. federal income tax rate and an assumed combined state and local income tax rate) to the amount OneWater Inc. would have been required to pay had it not been able to utilize any of the tax benefits subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. Thus, the amount and timing of any payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are also dependent upon significant future events, including those noted above in respect of estimating the amount and timing of OneWater Inc.s realization of tax benefits. Any distributions made by OneWater LLC to OneWater Inc. in order to enable OneWater Inc. to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement, as well as any corresponding pro rata distributions made to the other OneWater Unit Holders could have an adverse impact on our liquidity.\nThe payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon a TRA Holder's having a continued ownership interest in OneWater Inc. or OneWater LLC. In addition, certain of the TRA Holders rights (including the right to receive payments) under the Tax Receivable Agreement are transferable in connection with transfers permitted under the OneWater LLC Agreement of the corresponding OneWater LLC Units or, subject to OneWater Inc.s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), after the corresponding OneWater LLC Units have been acquired pursuant to the Redemption Right or Call Right. For additional information regarding the Tax Receivable Agreement, see Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement in this Form 10-K.\nIn certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nIf OneWater Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations) or the Tax Receivable Agreement terminates early (at OneWater Inc.s election or as a result of OneWater Inc.s breach), OneWater Inc. would be required to make an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future payments to be made by it under the Tax Receivable Agreement (determined by applying a discount rate equal to the twelve-month SOFR published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited plus 171.513 basis points) and such early termination payment is expected to be substantial. The calculation of anticipated future payments is based upon certain assumptions and deemed events set forth in the Tax Receivable Agreement, including (i) that OneWater Inc. has sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the tax benefits covered by the Tax Receivable Agreement, and (ii) that any OneWater LLC Units (other than those held by OneWater Inc.) outstanding on the termination date are deemed to be redeemed on the termination date. Any early termination payment may be made significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the early termination payment relates.\nIf OneWater Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement) or the Tax Receivable Agreement otherwise terminates early (at OneWater Inc.s election or as a result of OneWater Inc.s breach), OneWater Inc.s obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing certain mergers, asset sales, or other forms of business combinations or changes of control. For example, if the Tax Receivable Agreement were terminated immediately after the date hereof, and taking into account any redemptions that occurred prior thereto, the estimated early termination payment would, in the aggregate, be approximately $25.4 million (determined by applying a discount rate equal to the twelve-month SOFR published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited plus 171.513 basis points, applied against an undiscounted liability of $45.8 million calculated based on certain assumptions, including but not limited to a $25.62 per share price, an estimated blended statutory U.S. federal, state and local corporate income tax rate of 24.8%, no material change in U.S. federal income tax law, and that OneWater Inc. will have sufficient taxable income to utilize such estimated tax benefits). The foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payment could differ materially. In the event that OneWater Inc.s obligation to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement is accelerated as a result of a change of control, where applicable, we generally expect the accelerated payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration. However, OneWater Inc. may be required to fund such payment from other sources, and as a result, any early termination of the Tax Receivable Agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity. We do not currently expect to cause an acceleration due to OneWater Inc.s breach, and we do not currently expect that OneWater Inc. would elect to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, except in cases where the early termination payment would not be material. There can be no assurance that OneWater Inc. will be able to meet its obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Please read Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Tax Receivable Agreement in this Form 10-K.\nIn the event that OneWater Inc.s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are accelerated upon certain mergers, other forms of business combinations or other changes of control, the consideration payable to holders of OneWater Inc.s Class A common stock could be substantially reduced.\nIf OneWater Inc. experiences a change of control (as defined under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which includes certain mergers, asset sales and other forms of business combinations), OneWater Inc. would be obligated to make an immediate payment, and such payment may be significantly in advance of, and may materially exceed, the actual realization, if any, of the future tax benefits to which the payment relates. As a result of this payment obligation, holders of OneWater Inc.s Class A common stock could receive substantially less consideration in connection with a change of control transaction than they would receive in the absence of such obligation. Further, OneWater Inc.s payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement are not conditioned upon the TRA Holders having a continued interest in OneWater Inc. or OneWater LLC. Accordingly, the TRA Holders interests may conflict with those of the holders of OneWater Inc.s Class A common stock. Please read - In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nOneWater Inc. will not be reimbursed for any payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement in the event that any tax benefits are subsequently disallowed.\nPayments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are based on the tax reporting positions that OneWater Inc. determines and the IRS or another tax authority may challenge all or part of the tax basis increase, as well as other related tax positions OneWater Inc. takes, and a court could sustain such challenge. The TRA Holders will not reimburse OneWater Inc. for any payments previously made under the Tax Receivable Agreement if any tax benefits that have given rise to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement are subsequently disallowed, except that excess payments made to any TRA Holder will be netted against future payments that would otherwise be made to such TRA Holder, if any, after OneWater Inc.s determination of such excess (which determination may be made a number of years following the initial payment and after future payments have been made). As a result, in such circumstances, OneWater Inc. could make payments that are greater than its actual cash tax savings, if any, and may not be able to recoup those payments, which could materially adversely affect its liquidity.\nIf OneWater LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, OneWater Inc. and OneWater LLC might be subject to potentially significant tax inefficiencies, and OneWater Inc. would not be able to recover payments previously made by it under the Tax Receivable Agreement even if the corresponding tax benefits were subsequently determined to have been unavailable due to such status.\nWe intend to operate such that OneWater LLC does not become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A publicly traded partnership is a partnership the interests of which are traded on an established securities market or are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof. Under certain circumstances, redemptions of OneWater LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right (or the Call Right) or other transfers of OneWater LLC Units could cause OneWater LLC to be treated as a publicly traded partnership. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide for certain safe harbors from treatment as a publicly traded partnership, and we intend to operate such that redemptions or other transfers of OneWater LLC Units qualify for one or more such safe harbors. For example, we intend to limit the number of unitholders of OneWater LLC, and the OneWater LLC Agreement provides for limitations on the ability of unitholders of OneWater LLC to transfer their OneWater LLC Units and provides OneWater Inc., as managing member of OneWater LLC, with the right to impose restrictions (in addition to those already in place) on the ability of unitholders of OneWater LLC to redeem their OneWater LLC Units pursuant to the Redemption Right to the extent OneWater Inc. believes it is necessary to ensure that OneWater LLC will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nIf OneWater LLC were to become a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, significant tax inefficiencies might result for OneWater Inc. and for OneWater LLC. In addition, OneWater Inc. may not be able to realize tax benefits covered under the Tax Receivable Agreement, and OneWater Inc. would not be able to recover any payments previously made by it under the Tax Receivable Agreement, even if the corresponding tax benefits (including any claimed increase in the tax basis of OneWater LLCs assets) were subsequently determined to have been unavailable.\nChanges to applicable tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our business and future profitability.\nWe are subject to various complex and evolving U.S. federal, state and local taxes. U.S. federal, state and local tax laws, policies, statutes, rules, regulations or ordinances could be interpreted, changed, modified or applied adversely to us, in each case, possibly with retroactive effect, and may have an adverse effect on our business and future profitability.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, and local taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our Class A common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our stockholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights, including preferences over our Class A common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our Board of Directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our Class A common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the Class A common stock.\nIf we were deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a result of our ownership of OneWater LLC, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder Sections 3(a)(1)(A) and (C) of the 1940 Act, a company generally will be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the 1940 Act if (i) it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or (ii) it engages, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We do not believe that we are an investment company, as such term is defined in either of those sections of the 1940 Act.\nAs the sole managing member of OneWater LLC, we control and operate OneWater LLC. On that basis, we believe that our interest in OneWater LLC is not an investment security as that term is used in the 1940 Act. However, if we were to cease participation in the management of OneWater LLC, our interest in OneWater LLC could be deemed an investment security for purposes of the 1940 Act.\nWe and OneWater LLC intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company. However, if we were to be deemed an investment company, restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts cease publishing research or reports about our business, if they adversely change their recommendations regarding our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our Class A common stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our informational technology systems or a cybersecurity event.\nOur business is dependent upon the successful operation of our information technology systems. Our information technology systems enhance cross-selling opportunities and integrate each level of operations on a company-wide basis, including but not limited to purchasing, inventory, receivables, payables, financial reporting, budgeting, marketing and sales management. Our information systems are also used to prepare our consolidated financial and operating data.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities and cyber-related attacks pose a risk to the security of our and our customers, suppliers and third-party service providers products, systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Risks to our information technology systems include potential breakdowns, invasions, viruses, cyber-attacks, cyber-fraud, security breaches, and destruction or interruption of our information technology systems or data. From time to time, unauthorized parties have attempted to gain access to our systems or facilities, or those of third parties with whom we do business, through fraud, trickery or other forms of deceiving our team members, contractors, vendors and temporary staff. While no instances of unauthorized access have been material to date, we continue to attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems and maintenance of protective systems. We remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats.\nWe collect and store personal data through the ordinary course of our business that is subject to data privacy and information security laws and regulations. We also work with third-party partners that may in the course of their business relationship with us collect, store, process and transmit sensitive data on our behalf and in connection with our products and services offerings. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our or our third-party partners information technology systems may be vulnerable to security breaches, ransomware theft, cyber phishing attacks, cyber-attacks created through artificial intelligence, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, inability to use our systems, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, and operational disruptions. While no system failures, cyberattacks or security breaches have been material to date, we may be, unable to anticipate, detect or prevent such events. Despite ongoing efforts to improve our ability to protect our information technology systems and data stored thereon or transmitted thereby from compromise, we may not be able to protect all of our information technology systems or data.\nOur efforts to improve security and protect data from compromise may also identify previously undiscovered instances of security breaches or other cyber-related attack. It is possible that we might not be aware of a successful cyber-related attack on our systems until well after the incident. Any unauthorized access to or material failure of our information technology systems, or systems used by our third-party suppliers or service providers, could result in negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, or litigation or regulatory action, all of which could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operations, or cash flows.\nAdditionally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted certain remote work policies, as did many of our service providers. The continued prevalence of remote working has increased our vulnerability to risks related to our computer and communications hardware and software systems and exacerbated certain related risks, including risks of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks. Controls employed by our information technology department and our customers and third-party service providers could prove inadequate.\nWe are subject to laws, rules, regulations and policies regarding data privacy and security, and may be subject to additional related laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate or expand. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and reinterpretation, and any real or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could result in claims, changes to our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost of operations or other harm to our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws, directives, rules and policies relating to privacy and the collection, protection, use, retention, security, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data and other data. The regulatory framework for data privacy and security worldwide is continuously evolving and developing and, as a result, interpretation and implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. In addition, new laws, amendments to or reinterpretations of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations may require us to incur additional costs and restrict our business operations, and may require us to change how we use, collect, store, transfer or otherwise process certain types of personal data, including by implementing new processes to comply with those laws and our customers exercise of their rights thereunder. These laws also are not uniform, as certain laws may be more stringent or broader in scope, or offer greater individual rights, with respect to sensitive and personal information, and such laws may differ from each other, which may complicate compliance efforts. Any real or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with any applicable federal, state or similar foreign law, rule, regulation, industry standard, policy, certification or order relating to data privacy and security, or any compromise of security that results in the theft, unauthorized access, acquisition, use, disclosure, or misappropriation of personal data or other customer data, could result in significant awards, fines, civil or criminal penalties or judgments, proceedings or litigation by governmental agencies or customers, including class action privacy litigation in certain jurisdictions and negative publicity and reputational harm, one or all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be named in litigation, which may result in substantial costs and reputational harm and divert managements attention and resources.\nWe face legal risks in our business, including claims from disputes with our employees and our former employees and claims associated with general commercial disputes, product liability, personal injury and other matters. Risks associated with legal liability often are difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude can remain unknown for significant periods of time. While we maintain insurance of the types and in the amounts that we believe are customary and adequate, the amount of insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover a claim and the continued availability of certain insurance cannot be assured. Additionally, we may be named in the future as defendants of class action lawsuits. Negative publicity from litigation, whether or not resulting in a substantial cost, could materially damage our reputation. We may in the future be the target of litigation and this litigation may result in substantial costs and reputational harm and divert managements attention and resources. Costs, harm to our reputation and diversion could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in accounting standards could significantly affect our results of operations and the presentation of those results.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, or other accounting organizations or governmental entities frequently issue new pronouncements or new interpretations of existing accounting standards. Changes in accounting standards, how the accounting standards are interpreted, or the adoption of new accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results, and could even retroactively affect previously reported transactions, and may require that we make significant changes to our systems, processes and controls. Changes resulting from these new standards may result in materially different financial results and may require that we change how we process, analyze and report financial information and that we change financial reporting controls. Such changes in accounting standards may have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, and income, which may negatively impact our financial results.\nAdverse federal or state tax policies or changes in law could have a negative effect on us.\nChanges in federal and state tax laws, such as an imposition of luxury taxes on new boat purchases, increases in prevailing tax rates, and removal of certain interest deductions, may influence consumers decisions to purchase products we offer and could have a negative effect on our sales. For example, during 1991 and 1992, the federal government imposed a luxury tax on new recreational boats with sales prices in excess of $100,000, which coincided with a sharp decline in boating industry sales from a high of more than $17.9 billion in 1988 to a low of $10.3 billion in 1992. Any increase in tax rates, including those on capital gains and dividends, particularly those on high-income taxpayers, could adversely affect our boat sales.\nOur business could be materially adversely impacted by the widespread outbreak of a contagious disease.\nIn response to the widespread outbreak of a contagious disease, national, state and local governments in affected regions have, and may again, implement safety precautions, including shelter in place orders, travel restrictions, business closures, cancellations of public gatherings, including boat shows, and other measures. These measures have affected our ability to sell and service boats and may again require us to temporarily close or partially close certain locations. Organizations and individuals may take additional steps to avoid or reduce infection, including limiting travel, staying home, working from home and limiting participation in certain activities, or other measures, which may also affect our ability to operate our marine retailer locations or our manufacturing facilities.\nIf the negative economic effects of a widespread contagious disease continue for a prolonged period of time, it could lead to a reduction in demand for our products, which would adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in the capital markets, as a result of a global pandemic, may also adversely affect our ability to access capital and additional liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic's effects led to disruptions in our supply chain, including our ability to obtain boats and parts from our suppliers. We experienced shortages of inventory in 2021 and 2022, and we believe such shortages resulted in a reduction in our revenues for fiscal year 2021 and 2022. Though disruptions in our supply chain eased during 2023, such shortages could again adversely impact our revenues for future periods. It is possible that such shortages could become more severe as a result of a global pandemic and its effects on, among other things, supply chains, operations and consumer demand. It is not possible to estimate the entirety of the effect that COVID-19 or any other future global pandemic will have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners. Item 1B.

Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. In the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur Class A common stock is traded on Nasdaq under the symbol ONEW. As of November 28, 2023, there were 14,539,056 shares of Class A common stock and 1,429,940 shares of Class B common stock outstanding. There is no market for our Class B common stock. Each share of Class B common stock has no economic rights but entitles its holders to one vote on all matters to be voted on by the shareholders generally.\nHolders of Record\nAs of November 28, 2023 there were 6 and 4 stockholders of record of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, respectively. In the case of our Class A common stock, the actual number of holders is greater than this number of record holders, and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners, but whose shares are held in street name by brokers or held by other nominees. The number of holders of record of Class A common stock also does not include stockholders whose shares may be held in trust by other entities.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph illustrates a comparison of the total cumulative stockholder return for our Class A common stock since February 7, 2020, which is the date our shares began trading, through September 30, 2023, to two indices: the Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 500 Retail Index. The graph assumes an initial investment of $100 on February 7, 2020, in our Class A common stock, the stocks comprising the Russell 2000 Index, and the stocks comprising the S&P 500 Retail Index. The calculations of cumulative shareholder return on our Class A common stock, the Russell 2000 Index and the S&P 500 Retail Index include reinvestment of dividends.

The cash dividend of approximately $27.1 million was paid on July 19, 2021 to holders of Class A common stock and OneWater Unit Holders. Additionally, a $1.0 million cash dividend for restricted stock unit holders was accrued for payment to holders upon future vesting of restricted stock unit awards outstanding on the date the dividend was declared. During the year ended September 30, 2023, $0.3 million of the previously accrued balance was paid to restricted stock unit holders. The remaining $0.5 million is recorded in other payables and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.\nWe do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends to holders of our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently intend to retain future earnings, if any, to finance the growth of our business.

Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements, investment opportunities, statutory restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, under our Credit Facilities, OWAO is restricted from paying cash dividends, and we expect these restrictions to continue in the future, which may in turn limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends may also be restricted by the terms of any future credit agreement or any future debt or preferred equity securities that we or our subsidiaries may issue. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock- While our Board of Directors declared a one-time special cash dividend of $1.80 per share on June 17, 2021, we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our Class A common stock, and our Credit Facilities place certain restrictions on our ability to do so.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by applicable law.\nOverview\nWe believe that we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States with 98 dealerships, 11 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces as of September 30, 2023. Our dealer groups are located within highly attractive markets throughout the Southeast, Gulf Coast, Mid-Atlantic and Northeast, many of which are in the top twenty states for marine retail expenditures. We believe that we are a market leader by volume in sales of premium boats in many of the markets in which we operate. In addition to boat sales, we also generate sales from related products including finance & insurance and service, parts & other sales. The recent acquisitions of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem significantly expanded our sales of marine parts and accessories. The combination of our significant scale, diverse inventory, access to premium boat brands, access to a broad array of parts and accessories and meaningful group brand equity enables us to provide a consistently professional experience as reflected in the number of our repeat customers and Dealership same-store sales growth.\nWe were formed in 2014 as OneWater LLC through the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine, which created a marine retail platform that collectively owned and operated 19 dealerships. Since the combination in 2014, we have acquired a total of 80 additional dealerships, 12 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces through 33 acquisitions. Our current portfolio as of September 30, 2023 consists of multiple brands which are recognized on a local, regional or national basis. Because of this, we believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States based on number of dealerships and total boats sold. While we have opportunistically opened new dealerships in select markets, or launched additional parts and accessory products, we believe that it is generally more effective economically and operationally to acquire existing businesses with experienced staff and established reputations.\nEffective August 9, 2022, our reportable segments changed as a result of the Companys acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem, which changed managements reporting structure and operating activities. We now report our operations through two reportable segments: Dealerships and Distribution.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Dealerships reporting segment includes operations of 98 dealerships in 15 states including Florida, Texas, Alabama and Georgia, among others, and represents approximately 91% of revenues. The Dealership segment engages in the sale of new and pre-owned boats, arranges financing and insurance products, performs repairs and maintenance services, offers marine related parts and accessories and offers slip and storage accommodations in certain locations.\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Distribution reporting segment includes the activity of PartsVu, Ocean Bio Chem and T-H Marine and its subsidiaries which together operate 11 distribution centers/warehouses in Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma, Indiana, Tennessee and Illinois and represents approximately 9% of revenues. The Distribution segment engages in the manufacturing, assembly and distribution of marine-related products (and adjacent industries).\nThe boat dealership market is highly fragmented and is comprised of approximately 4,200 dealerships nationwide. Most competing boat retailers are operated by local business owners who own three or fewer stores; however we do have other large competitors including MarineMax and Bass Pro Shops. We believe we are one of the largest and fastest-growing marine retailers in the United States. Despite our size, we comprise less than 3% of total industry sales. Our scale and business model allow us to leverage our extensive inventory to provide consumers with the ability to find a boat that matches their preferences (e.g., make, model, color, configuration and other options) and to deliver the boat within days while providing a personalized sales experience. In addition to boat sales, we also generate sales from related products including finance & insurance and service, parts & other sales. The recent acquisitions of T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem have significantly expanded our sales of marine parts and accessories. Our strategic growth in this area is also expected to materially expand our addressable market in the parts and accessories business. We are able to operate with a comparatively higher degree of profitability than other independent retailers because we allocate support resources across our broader base, focus on high-margin service parts and accessories, utilize floor plan financing and provide core back-office functions on a scale that many independent retailers are unable to match. We seek to be the leading marine retailer by total market share within each boating market and within the product segments in which we participate. To the extent that we are not, we will evaluate acquiring other local retailers in order to increase our sales, to add additional brands or to provide us with additional high-quality personnel.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its related effects positively impacted our sales as more customers desired to engage in outdoor recreational activities in a socially distanced manner. However, the COVID-19 pandemic also caused significant supply chain challenges as suppliers were faced with business closures and shipping delays. This led to an industry wide inventory shortage of boats, engines and certain marine parts. As of September 30, 2023, we have seen considerable improvements in the supply chain and believe we are returning to the more traditional seasonal cycles of our business. The ultimate impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 or another global pandemic and its related effects remains uncertain and depends on various factors including consumer demand, our ability to safely operate locations and the existence and extent of a prolonged economic downturn.\nTrends and Other Factors Impacting Our Performance\nAcquisitions\nWe are a highly acquisitive company. Since the combination of Singleton Marine and Legendary Marine in 2014, we have acquired 80 additional dealerships through 28 dealer group acquisitions. Our team remains focused on expanding our dealership growth in regions with strong boating cultures, enhancing the customer experience and generating value for our shareholders. In addition to dealership acquisitions, the Company has strategically acquired parts and accessories companies as part of our growth and diversification strategy. We have acquired 12 distribution centers and warehouses through the acquisition of 5 parts and accessories companies. We plan to continue to strategically evaluate and complete acquisitions moving forward. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we completed 3 and 8 acquisitions, respectively.\nSince September 30, 2023, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 20% of Quality Boats on October 31, 2023.\nWe have an extensive acquisition track record within the retail marine industry and believe we have developed a reputation for treating sellers and their staff in an honest and fair manner. We typically retain the management team and name of the acquired group. We believe this practice preserves customer relationships and goodwill in the local marketplace. We believe our reputation and scale have positioned us as a buyer of choice for marine retailers who want to sell their businesses. Our strategy is to acquire dealerships at attractive EBITDA multiples and then grow same-store sales while benefiting from cost-reducing synergies. Historically, we have typically acquired dealerships for less than 4.0x EBITDA on a trailing twelve month basis and believe that we will be able to continue to make attractive acquisitions within this range. With the expansion of our Distribution segment, we look to acquire parts and accessories manufacturing and distribution companies within a range of 5.0x - 10.0x EBITDA on a trailing twelve month basis, depending on the size of the business.\nGeneral Economic Conditions\nGeneral economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact our operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national, or global economic developments or uncertainties, including the adverse economic effects of a global pandemic, supply chain constraints, or a prolonged economic downturn, could reduce consumer spending and adversely affect our business. Consumer spending on discretionary goods may also decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels, higher interest rates or higher fuel costs, even if prevailing economic conditions are otherwise favorable. Economic conditions in areas in which we operate dealerships, particularly in the Southeast, can have a major impact on our overall results of operations. Local influences, such as corporate downsizing, inclement weather such as hurricanes and other storms, environmental conditions, and global public health concerns and events could adversely affect our operations in certain markets and in certain periods. Any extended period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence is likely to have a negative effect on our business.\nOur business was significantly impacted during the recessionary period that began in 2007. This period of weakness in consumer spending and depressed economic conditions had a substantial negative effect on our operating results. In response to these conditions we reduced our inventory purchases, closed certain dealerships and reduced headcount. Additionally, in an effort to counteract the downturn, we increased our focus on pre-owned sales, parts and repair services, and finance & insurance services. As a result, we surpassed our pre-recession sales levels in less than 24 months. While we believe the measures we took significantly reduced the impact of the downturn on the business, we cannot guarantee similar results in the event of a future downturn. Additionally, we cannot predict the timing or length of unfavorable economic or industry conditions, including a downturn as a result of pandemics, rising interest rates, inflation, or the extent to which they could adversely affect our operating results.\nAlthough past economic conditions have adversely affected our operating results, we believe we are capable of responding in a manner that allows us to substantially outperform the industry and gain market share. We believe our ability to capture such market share enables us to align our retail strategies with the desires of customers. We expect our core strengths, including retail and acquisition strategies, will allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities as they occur, despite market conditions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods presented. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Actual outcomes could differ materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. Set forth below are the estimates that we have identified as critical to our business operations and understanding our results of operations, based on the high degree of judgment or complexity in their application.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of new and pre-owned boat inventory is determined using the specific identification method. New and pre-owned boat sales histories indicated that the overwhelming majority of such boats are sold for, or in excess of, the cost to purchase those boats. In assessing the lower of cost or net realizable value, we consider the aging of the boats, historical sales of a particular product and current market conditions. There are inherent uncertainties in assessing net realizable value as management must make assumptions and apply judgment to changes in the market, brands and other factors that drive consumer preferences and spending.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Others (ASC 350), we review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth fiscal quarter, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference would represent the amount of required goodwill impairment in accordance with ASC 350. To the extent the reporting units earnings decline significantly or there are changes in one or more of these inputs that would result in a lower valuation, it could cause the carrying value of the reporting unit to exceed its fair value and thus require the Company to record goodwill impairment.\nIdentifiable intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions we have completed consist of trade names, developed technologies, including design libraries, and customer relationships. We have determined that trade names have an indefinite life, as there is no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate value as long as the trade name is utilized by the marine retailer, and therefore, are not subject to amortization. Developed technologies and customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of ten years and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nImpairment testing requires the assessment of both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to whether there has been a significant or adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset and/or significant or adverse changes in cash flow projections or earnings forecasts. These assessments require management to make judgements, assumptions and estimates regarding the macroeconomic and industry conditions, our financial performance, and other factors and are often interdependent; therefore, they do not change in isolation. Factors that management must estimate include, among others, the economic lives of the assets, sales volume, pricing, royalty rates, long-term growth rates, tax rates, capital spending, and customers financial condition. The estimates and assumptions used in these tests are evaluated and updated as appropriate. The variability of these factors depends on a number of conditions, including uncertainty about future events, and thus our accounting estimates may change from period to period. If other assumptions and estimates had been used when these tests were performed, impairment charges could have changed. As mentioned above, these factors do not change in isolation and, therefore, we do not believe it is practicable or meaningful to present the impact of changing a single factor. Furthermore, if management uses different assumptions in future periods or if different conditions exist in future periods, additional impairment charges could result.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company determined that there were circumstances that indicated that impairment may have occurred. We engaged a third-party independent valuation professional to perform a quantitative analysis of the fair values compared to the carrying value and, as a result, recorded a loss on impairment of $147.4 million. We do not believe there is currently a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the judgments and assumptions used in our assessments of goodwill and long-lived assets which would result in any further material effect on operating results. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was greater than its carrying amount, and as a result, no impairment for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets was required.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the date of the acquisition. Determination of the estimated fair value assigned to each asset acquired or liability assumed can materially impact the net income in subsequent periods through depreciation and amortization and potential impairment charges.\nThe most critical areas of judgment in applying the acquisition method include selecting the appropriate valuation techniques and assumptions that are used to measure the acquired assets and assumed liabilities at fair value, particularly for inventory, contingent consideration, trade names, developed technologies, including design libraries, and customer relationships. The fair value of acquired inventory is based on manufacturer invoice cost, curtailments, and market data. The significant estimates used to value contingent consideration are future earnings and discount rates. Management estimated the fair value of the trade names and developed technologies using the relief from royalty method and customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value determination of the trade names and design libraries required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenues and the selection of the royalty rate and discount rate. The fair value determination of the customer relationships require management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to future revenues attributable to existing customers, future EBITDA margins and the selection of the customer attrition rate and discount rate. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value.\nIn selecting the techniques and assumptions noted above, we generally engage third-party, independent valuation professionals to assist us in developing the assumptions and applying the valuation techniques to a particular business combination transaction. In particular, the discount rates selected are compared to and evaluated with (i) the industry weighted-average cost of capital, (ii) the inherent risks associated with each type of asset and (iii) the level and timing of future cash flows appropriately reflecting market participant assumptions.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nRevenue\nWe have a diversified revenue profile that is comprised of new boat sales, pre-owned boat sales, finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories. During different phases of the economic cycle, consumer behavior may shift away from new boats; however, we are well-positioned to generate revenue from pre-owned boats, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories, which have all historically increased during periods of economic uncertainty. We generate pre-owned sales from boats traded-in for new and pre-owned boats, boats purchased from customers, brokerage transactions, consignment sales and wholesale sales. We continue to focus on all aspects of our business including non-boat sales of finance & insurance products, repair and maintenance services, and parts and accessories. Although non-boat sales contributed approximately 19.5%, 17.8% and 11.3% to revenue in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, due to the higher gross margin on these product and service lines, non-boat sales contributed 35.6%, 30.1% and 25.8% to gross profit in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We have also diversified our business across geographies, dealership types (e.g., fresh water and salt water), and product offerings (e.g., focus on parts and accessories businesses through PartsVu, T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem) in order to reduce the effects of seasonality and cyclicality of our business. In addition to seasonality, revenue and operating results may be significantly affected by quarter-to-quarter changes in economic conditions, manufacturer incentive programs, adverse weather conditions and other developments outside of our control.\nGross Profit\nWe calculate gross profit as revenue less cost of sales. Cost of sales consists of actual amounts paid for products, costs of services (primarily labor), transportation costs from manufacturers to our dealerships and vendor consideration. Gross profit excludes the majority of our depreciation and amortization, which is presented separately in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGross Profit Margin\nOur overall gross profit margin varies with our revenue mix. Sales of new and pre-owned boats, which have comparable margins, generally result in a lower gross profit margin than our non-boat sales. As a result, when revenue from non-boat sales increases as a percentage of total revenue, we expect our overall gross profit margin to increase.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of base salaries and incentive-based compensation, advertising, rent, insurance, utilities, and other customary operating expenses. A portion of our cost structure is variable (such as sales commissions and incentive compensation), or controllable (such as advertising), which we believe allows us to adapt to changes in the retail environment over the long term. We typically evaluate our variable expenses, selling expenses and all other selling, general and administrative expenses in the aggregate as a percentage of total revenue.\nDealership Same-Store Sales\nWe assess the organic growth of our Dealership segment revenue on a same-store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same-store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial results and provides relevant information to assess our performance. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealerships thirteenth month of operations under our ownership and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. Dealerships relocated within an existing market remain in the comparable dealership base for all periods. Additionally, amounts related to closed dealerships are excluded from each comparative base period. Because Dealership same-store sales may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense - other, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization and other (income) expense, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as the change in fair value of contingent consideration, loss on extinguishment of debt, loss on impairment and transaction costs. See -Comparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure for more information and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nSummary of Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nThe comparability of our results of operations between the periods discussed below is naturally affected by the acquisitions we have completed during such periods. We are also continuously evaluating and pursuing acquisitions on an ongoing basis, and such acquisitions, if completed, will continue to impact the comparability of our financial results. While we expect continued growth and strategic acquisitions in the future, our acquisitions may have materially different characteristics than our historical results, and such differences in economics may impact the comparability of our future results of operations to our historical results.\nFiscal Year 2023 Acquisitions\nEffective October 1, 2022, we acquired Taylor Marine Centers, a full service marine retailer with locations in Maryland and Delaware\nEffective December 1, 2022, we acquired Harbor View Marine, a full service marine retailer with locations in Florida and Alabama\nEffective September 1, 2023, we acquired Harbor Pointe Marina, a full service marine retailer with one location in Alabama\nWe refer to the fiscal year 2023 acquisitions described above collectively as the 2023 Acquisitions.

The 2023 Dispositions are fully reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2023, as the transactions took place on the final day of fiscal year 2023. There were no dispositions during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nOther Factors Affecting Comparability of Our Future Results of Operations to Our Historical Results of Operations\nOur historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results. As we further implement controls, processes and infrastructure applicable to companies with publicly traded equity securities, including the integration of acquired companies, it is likely that we will incur additional selling, general, and administrative expenses relative to historical periods. Our future results will depend on our ability to efficiently manage our combined operations and execute our business strategy.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended September 30, 2023, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022\nDescription Amount % of\nRevenue Amount % of\nRevenue $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nRevenues:\nNew boat $ 1,223,691 63.2 % $ 1,139,331 65.3 % $ 84,360 7.4 %\nPre-owned boat 334,477 17.3 % 294,832 16.9 % 39,645 13.4 %\nFinance & insurance income 56,325 2.9 % 55,977 3.2 % 348 0.6 %\nService, parts & other 321,817 16.6 % 254,682 14.6 % 67,135 26.4 %\nTotal revenues 1,936,310 100.0 % 1,744,822 100.0 % 191,488 11.0 %\nGross Profit\nNew boat 268,469 13.9 % 305,305 17.5 % (36,836) -12.1 %\nPre-owned boat 75,953 3.9 % 81,665 4.7 % (5,712) -7.0 %\nFinance & insurance 56,325 2.9 % 55,977 3.2 % 348 0.6 %\nService, parts & other 134,379 6.9 % 110,708 6.3 % 23,671 21.4 %\nTotal gross profit 535,126 27.6 % 553,655 31.7 % (18,529) -3.3 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 345,524 17.8 % 302,113 17.3 % 43,411 14.4 %\nDepreciation and amortization 23,898 1.2 % 15,605 0.9 % 8,293 53.1 %\nTransaction costs 1,839 0.1 % 7,724 0.4 % (5,885) -76.2 %\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (1,604) -0.1 % 10,380 0.6 % (11,984) -115.5 %\nLoss on impairment 147,402 7.6 % - - % 147,402 100.0 %\nIncome from operations 18,067 0.9 % 217,833 12.5 % (199,766) -91.7 %\nInterest expense - floor plan 25,080 1.3 % 4,647 0.3 % 20,433 439.7 %\nInterest expense - other 34,557 1.8 % 13,201 0.8 % 21,356 161.8 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - - % 356 - % (356) -100.0 %\nOther expense (income), net 953 - % 3,793 0.2 % (2,840) -74.9 %\nNet (loss) income before income tax (benefit) expense (42,523) -2.2 % 195,836 11.2 % (238,359) -121.7 %\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (3,412) -0.2 % 43,225 2.5 % (46,637) -107.9 %\nNet (loss) income (39,111) -2.0 % 152,611 8.7 % (191,722) -125.6 %\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests (3,810) (2,998)\nNet loss (income) attributable to non-controlling interests of One Water Marine Holdings, LLC 4,329 (18,669)\nNet (loss) income attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. $ (38,592) $ 130,944\nRevenue\nOverall, revenue increased by $191.5 million, or 11.0%, to $1,936.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $1,744.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Revenue generated from Dealership same-store sales increased 3.0% for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of new and pre-owned boats, the number of pre-owned boats sold, the model mix of boats sold, and an increase in service, parts & other sales. Overall revenue increased by $48.1 million as a result of our increase in Dealership same-store sales and $143.4 million from revenue increases in our Distribution segment as well as revenue not eligible for inclusion in the Dealership same-store sales base. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealerships thirteenth month of operations under our ownership, and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. For the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, we completed 3 and 8 acquisitions, respectively.\nNew Boat Sales\nNew boat sales increased by $84.4 million, or 7.4%, to $1,223.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $1,139.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was the result of our Dealership same-store sales growth during the twelve-month period, our acquisitions and an increase in our average selling price. We believe the increase in sales was primarily due to continued execution of operational improvements on previously acquired dealers, the mix on boat brands and models sold, and product improvements in the functionality of technology which drove average unit prices higher.\nPre-owned Boat Sales\nPre-owned boat sales increased by $39.6 million, or 13.4%, to $334.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $294.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consigned and wholesale), which causes periodic and seasonal fluctuations in the average sales price. The increase in pre-owned boat sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold and average selling price which was driven by Dealership same-store sales growth and acquisition growth.\nFinance & Insurance Income\nWe generate revenue from arranging finance & insurance products, including financing, insurance and extended warranty contracts, to customers through various third-party financial institutions and insurance companies. Finance & insurance income increased by $0.3 million, or 0.6%, to $56.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily due to the additional new and pre-owned boat revenues, partially offset by the declining spreads charged to customers with the current high interest-rate environment. We remain very focused on improving sales of finance & insurance products throughout our dealer network and implementing best practices at acquired dealer groups and existing dealerships. Finance & insurance income is recorded net of related fees, including fees charged back due to any early cancellation of loan or insurance contracts by a customer. Since finance & insurance income is fee-based, we do not incur any related cost of sale.\nService, Parts & Other Sales\nService, parts & other sales increased by $67.1 million, or 26.4%, to $321.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $254.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase in service, parts & other sales is primarily due to the contributions from our recently acquired parts and accessories businesses, including Ocean Bio-Chem, as well as increases across the board in labor, parts, fuel and storage sales, driven by ancillary sales generated from our increase in new and pre-owned boat sales at our dealerships. Revenue for the Distribution segment are reported in service, parts & other sales and totaled $181.1 million and $135.9 million for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nGross Profit\nOverall, gross profit decreased by $18.5 million, or 3.3%, to $535.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $553.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was mainly due to industry margin normalization and the return of seasonality, partially offset by the impact of the 2023 Acquisitions, the 2022 Acquisitions and the Companys focus on dynamic pricing. Overall gross margins decreased 410 basis points to 27.6% for the year ended September 30, 2023 from 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022 due to the factors noted below.\nNew Boat Gross Profit\nNew boat gross profit decreased by $36.8 million, or 12.1%, to $268.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $305.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was due to the decrease in new boat gross profit margin. New boat gross profit as a percentage of new boat revenue was 21.9% for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 26.8% in the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in new boat gross profit and gross profit margin is due primarily to the normalization of new boat pricing following the COVID-19 pandemic and the return of seasonality.\nPre-owned Boat Gross Profit\nPre-owned boat gross profit decreased by $5.7 million, or 7.0%, to $76.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $81.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in pre-owned boat gross profit margin. Pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned boat revenue was 22.7% for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to 27.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022. The pre-owned gross profit margin primarily decreased as a result of the normalization of pre-owned boat pricing following the COVID-19 pandemic, the return of seasonality and a mix shift in the components of pre-owned sales including a reduction in brokerage sales. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consignment and wholesale), which may cause periodic and seasonal fluctuations in pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of revenue.\nFinance & Insurance Gross Profit\nFinance & insurance gross profit increased by $0.3 million, or 0.6%, to $56.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. Finance & insurance income is fee-based revenue for which we do not recognize incremental cost of sales.\nService, Parts & Other Gross Profit\nService, parts & other gross profit increased by $23.7 million, or 21.4%, to $134.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $110.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of our acquisitions of parts and accessories businesses, including Ocean Bio-Chem, but was also further enhanced by our Dealership sales growth. Service, parts & other gross profit as a percentage of service, parts & other revenue was 41.8% and 43.5% for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to a shift in the mix of revenue towards parts & accessories which has a lower gross profit percentage than service and other sales, as well as rising labor costs. Although the service, parts & other mix shifted and led to a year over year decrease in margin percentage, our parts and accessories gross profit percentage was still accretive to the overall company gross profit percentage of 27.6% for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $43.4 million, or 14.4%, to $345.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 from $302.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. This increase was primarily due to expenses incurred to support the overall increase in revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.8% from 17.3% for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher administrative expenses for the acquisitions in our Distribution segment, higher marketing expenses and increased costs as a result of the current personnel environment for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $8.3 million, or 53.1%, to $23.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to an increase in amortization of identifiable intangible assets for the 2022 Acquisitions as well as an increase in our property and equipment.\nTransaction Costs\nThe decrease in transaction costs of $5.9 million, or 76.2%, to $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $7.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 was primarily attributable to the fewer number of acquisitions completed during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to those completed during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized income of $1.6 million related to updated forecasts and accretion of contingent consideration liabilities related to fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023 acquisitions.\nLoss on Impairment\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a loss on impairment of $147.4 as a result of the quantitative assessment of the fair values compared to the carrying values of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for the Dealerships and Distribution segments. The impairment was largely driven by a decline in the Distribution segment's results as well as a decrease in the Company's market capitalization.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations decreased $199.8 million, or 91.7%, to $18.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $217.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease was primarily attributable to the 147.4 million loss on impairment, a $43.4 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and a $18.5 million decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in transaction costs and a $12.0 million decrease in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.\nInterest Expense - Floor Plan\nInterest expense - floor plan increased $20.4 million, or 439.7%, to $25.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase in floor plan interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in interest rates and the average inventory for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.\nInterest Expense - Other\nInterest expense - other increased $21.4 million, or 161.8%, to $34.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $13.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in the average balance of our long term debt during the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to the average balance during the year ended September 30, 2022 as well as an increase in interest rates.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nWe incurred no debt extinguishment expenses for the year ended September 30, 2023, as compared to $0.4 million in debt extinguishment expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022, related to the August 9, 2022 amendment of our term debt.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net decreased by $2.8 million to $1.0 million of expense for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to $3.8 million of expense for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in the unrealized loss on an equity investment and expenses associated with Hurricane Ian recorded, partially offset by the loss on disposal of businesses during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax (benefit) expense changed by $46.6 million, or 107.9%, to an income tax benefit of $3.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to income tax expense $43.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The change was primarily attributable to the 121.7% decrease in income before tax expense which was primarily related to the loss on impairment.\nNet (loss) Income\nNet (loss) income changed by $191.7 million to a net loss of $(39.1) million for the year ended September 30, 2023, compared to net income of $152.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The change was primarily attributable to the $147.4 million loss on impairment, the increases in selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense - floor plan and interest expense - other, all partially offset by the decrease in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended September 30, 2022, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021\nFor the Year Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nDescription Amount % of\nRevenue Amount % of\nRevenue $ Change % Change\n($ in thousands)\nRevenues:\nNew boat $ 1,139,331 65.3 % $ 872,680 71.1 % $ 266,651 30.6 %\nPre-owned boat 294,832 16.9 % 216,416 17.6 % 78,416 36.2 %\nFinance & insurance income 55,977 3.2 % 42,668 3.5 % 13,309 31.2 %\nService, parts & other 254,682 14.6 % 96,442 7.9 % 158,240 164.1 %\nTotal revenues 1,744,822 100.0 % 1,228,206 100.0 % 516,616 42.1 %\nGross Profit\nNew boat 305,305 17.5 % 210,916 17.2 % 94,389 44.8 %\nPre-owned boat 81,665 4.7 % 54,138 4.4 % 27,527 50.8 %\nFinance & insurance 55,977 3.2 % 42,668 3.5 % 13,309 31.2 %\nService, parts & other 110,708 6.3 % 49,733 4.0 % 60,975 122.6 %\nTotal gross profit 553,655 31.7 % 357,455 29.1 % 196,200 54.9 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 302,113 17.3 % 199,049 16.2 % 103,064 51.8 %\nDepreciation and amortization 15,605 0.9 % 5,411 0.4 % 10,194 188.4 %\nTransaction costs 7,724 0.4 % 869 0.1 % 6,855 788.8 %\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 10,380 0.6 % 3,249 0.3 % 7,131 219.5 %\nIncome from operations 217,833 12.5 % 148,877 12.1 % 68,956 46.3 %\nInterest expense - floor plan 4,647 0.3 % 2,566 0.2 % 2,081 81.1 %\nInterest expense - other 13,201 0.8 % 4,344 0.4 % 8,857 203.9 %\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 356 0.0 % - 0.0 % 356 100.0 %\nOther expense (income), net 3,793 0.2 % (248) 0.0 % 4,041 *\nIncome before income tax expense 195,836 11.2 % 142,215 11.6 % 53,621 37.7 %\nIncome tax expense 43,225 2.5 % 25,802 2.1 % 17,423 67.5 %\nNet income 152,611 8.7 % 116,413 9.5 % 36,198 31.1 %\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests (2,998) -\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests of One Water Marine Holdings, LLC (18,669) (37,354)\nNet income attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. $ 130,944 $ 79,059\nRevenue\nOverall, revenue increased by $516.6 million, or 42.1%, to $1,744.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $1,228.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Revenue generated from Dealership same-store sales increased 11.9% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to an increase in the average selling price of new boats, the number of pre-owned boats sold, the model mix of boats sold, an increase in finance & insurance sales and an increase in service, parts & other sales. We believe that COVID-19 had a positive overall impact on the retail marine industry during these periods as people sought recreational activities that could be done in a safe, socially distanced way. Overall revenue increased by $147.0 million as a result of our increase in Dealership same-store sales and $369.6 million from revenue from our Distribution segment as well as revenue not eligible for inclusion in the Dealership same-store sales base. New and acquired dealerships become eligible for inclusion in the comparable dealership base at the end of the dealerships thirteenth month of operations under our ownership, and revenues are only included for identical months in the same-store base periods. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, we completed 8 and 5 acquisitions, respectively.\nNew Boat Sales\nNew boat sales increased by $266.7 million, or 30.6%, to $1,139.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $872.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was the result of our Dealership same-store sales growth during the twelve-month period, our acquisitions and an increase in our average selling price. We believe the increase in sales was primarily due to continued execution of operational improvements on previously acquired dealers, the mix on boat brands and models sold, and product improvements in the functionality of technology which drove average unit prices higher.\nPre-owned Boat Sales\nPre-owned boat sales increased by $78.4 million, or 36.2%, to $294.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $216.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consigned and wholesale), which causes periodic and seasonal fluctuations in the average sales price. The increase in pre-owned boat sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of units sold which was driven by Dealership same-store sales growth and acquisition growth.\nFinance & Insurance Income\nWe generate revenue from arranging finance & insurance products, including financing, insurance and extended warranty contracts, to customers through various third-party financial institutions and insurance companies. Finance & insurance income increased by $13.3 million, or 31.2%, to $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily due to the additional new and pre-owned boat revenues. We remain very focused on improving sales of finance & insurance products throughout our dealer network and implementing best practices at acquired dealer groups and existing dealerships. Finance & insurance products decreased slightly as a percentage of total revenue to 3.2% in the year ended September 30, 2022 from 3.5% for the year ended September 30, 2021. Finance & insurance income is recorded net of related fees, including fees charged back due to any early cancellation of loan or insurance contracts by a customer. Since finance & insurance income is fee-based, we do not incur any related cost of sale.\nService, Parts & Other Sales\nService, parts & other sales increased by $158.2 million, or 164.1%, to $254.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $96.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase in service, parts & other sales is primarily due to the contributions from our recently acquired parts and accessories businesses, including T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, as well as increases across the board in labor, parts, fuel and storage sales, driven by ancillary sales generated from our increase in new and pre-owned boat sales at our dealerships.\nGross Profit\nOverall, gross profit increased by $196.2 million, or 54.9%, to $553.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $357.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was mainly due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales which was driven by increases in all revenue streams, the impact of the 2022 Acquisitions and the Companys focus on dynamic pricing. Overall gross margins increased 260 basis points to 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022 from 29.1% for the year ended September 30, 2021 due to the factors noted below.\nNew Boat Gross Profit\nNew boat gross profit increased by $94.4 million, or 44.8%, to $305.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $210.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was due to our overall increase in Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2022. New boat gross profit as a percentage of new boat revenue was 26.8% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 24.2% in the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in new boat gross profit and gross profit margin is due primarily to a shift in the mix and size of boat models sold, the margin profile of recently acquired locations, our emphasis on expanding new boat gross profit margins and the impact of industry wide inventory and supply chain constraints.\nPre-owned Boat Gross Profit\nPre-owned boat gross profit increased by $27.5 million, or 50.8%, to $81.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $54.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an overall increase in pre-owned revenue as a result of our Dealership same-store sales and acquired dealerships during fiscal year 2022. Pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of pre-owned boat revenue was 27.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to 25.0% for the year ended September 30, 2021. We sell a wide range of brands and sizes of pre-owned boats under different types of sales arrangements (e.g., trade-ins, brokerage, consignment and wholesale), which may cause periodic and seasonal fluctuations in pre-owned boat gross profit as a percentage of revenue. For the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, we experienced a strong increase in our gross profit on pre-owned sales for trade-ins, brokerage and consignment which all have a higher margin percentage than wholesale which saw a slight decrease in gross profit.\nFinance & Insurance Gross Profit\nFinance & insurance gross profit increased by $13.3 million, or 31.2%, to $56.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $42.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. Finance & insurance income is fee-based revenue for which we do not recognize incremental cost of sales.\nService, Parts & Other Gross Profit\nService, parts & other gross profit increased by $61.0 million, or 122.6%, to $110.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $49.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in gross profit was primarily the result of our acquisitions of parts and accessories businesses, including T-H Marine and Ocean Bio-Chem, but was also further enhanced by our Dealership same-store sales growth. Service, parts & other gross profit as a percentage of service, parts & other revenue was 43.5% and 51.6% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to a shift in the mix of revenue towards parts & accessories which has a lower gross profit percentage than service and other sales. Although the service, parts & other mix shifted and led to a year over year decrease in margin percentage, our parts and accessories gross profit percentage was still accretive to the overall company gross profit percentage of 31.7% for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $103.1 million, or 51.8%, to $302.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 from $199.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. This increase was primarily due to expenses incurred to support the overall increase in revenues and gross profit. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to 17.3% from 16.2% for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher variable personnel costs driven by the increased level of profitability for the year ended September 30, 2022 as well as increased costs given the current personnel environment.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased $10.2 million, or 188.4%, to $15.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to a $7.6 million increase in amortization of identifiable intangible assets, primarily attributable to the 2022 Acquisitions, as well as an increase in our property and equipment.\nTransaction Costs\nThe increase in transaction costs of $6.9 million, or 788.8%, to $7.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $0.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 was primarily attributable to expenses related to the 2022 Acquisitions.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred expenses of $10.4 million related to updated forecasts and accretion of contingent consideration liabilities related to fiscal 2021 and 2022 acquisitions.\nIncome from Operations\nIncome from operations increased $69.0 million, or 46.3%, to $217.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $148.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the $196.2 million increase in gross profit for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, partially offset by a $103.1 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, a $10.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $6.9 million increase in transaction costs and a $7.1 million increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.\nInterest Expense - Floor Plan\nInterest expense - floor plan increased $2.1 million, or 81.1%, to $4.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $2.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in floor plan interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in the average inventory for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 as well as an increase in interest rates.\nInterest Expense - Other\nInterest expense - other increased $8.9 million, or 203.9%, to $13.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $4.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in our long term debt which was primarily used to fund certain 2022 Acquisitions.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we incurred $0.4 million in debt extinguishment expenses related to the August 9, 2022 amendment of our term debt.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net changed by $4.0 million to $3.8 million of expense for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $0.2 million of income for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase is primarily attributable to the unrealized loss on our Forza X1, Inc. equity investment and expenses associated with Hurricane Ian.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense increased $17.4 million, or 67.5%, to $43.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, compared to $25.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the 37.7% increase in income before tax expense as well as the increased proportion of consolidated income before income tax expense that is allocated to OneWater Marine Inc. and therefore taxable due to the exchanges of shares of Class B common stock for shares of Class A common stock.\nNet Income\nNet income increased by $36.2 million to $152.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $116.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase was primarily attributable to the increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization and the increase in the change in fair value of contingent consideration during the same periods.\nComparison of Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense - other, income tax (benefit) expense, depreciation and amortization and other (income) expense, further adjusted to eliminate the effects of items such as the change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, loss on impairment and transaction costs.\nOur Board of Directors, management team and lenders use Adjusted EBITDA to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization) and other items (such as the change in fair value of contingent consideration, gain (loss) on extinguishment of debt, loss on impairment and transaction costs) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is not a financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP financial measure will provide useful information to investors and analysts in assessing our financial performance and results of operations across reporting periods by excluding items we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons we consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that we will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in our industry, our definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure for the periods presented.\nYear Ended September 30, 2023, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2022.\nYears Ended September 30,\nDescription 2023 2022 Change\n($ in thousands)\nNet (loss) income $ (39,111) $ 152,611 $ (191,722)\nInterest expense - other 34,557 13,201 21,356\nIncome tax (benefit) expense (3,412) 43,225 (46,637)\nDepreciation and amortization 26,788 16,297 10,491\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration (1,604) 10,380 (11,984)\nTransaction costs 1,839 7,724 (5,885)\nLoss on extinguishment of debt - 356 (356)\nLoss on impairment 147,402 - 147,402\nOther expense (income), net 953 3,793 (2,840)\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 167,412 $ 247,587 $ (80,175)\nAdjusted EBITDA was $167.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $247.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from the decrease in gross profit, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the increase in interest expense - floor plan for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.\nYear Ended September 30, 2022, Compared to Year Ended September 30, 2021.\nYears Ended September 30,\nDescription 2022 2021 Change\n($ in thousands)\nNet income $ 152,611 $ 116,413 $ 36,198\nInterest expense - other 13,201 4,344 8,857\nIncome tax expense 43,225 25,802 17,423\nDepreciation and amortization 16,297 5,411 10,886\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration 10,380 3,249 7,131\nTransaction costs 7,724 869 6,855\nLoss on extinguishment of debt 356 - 356\nOther expense (income), net 3,793 (248) 4,041\nAdjusted EBITDA $ 247,587 $ 155,840 $ 91,747\nAdjusted EBITDA was $247.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $155.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA resulted from our 11.9% increase in Dealership same-store sales growth for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, combined with the results of the 2022 Acquisitions and our ability to increase gross profit margins and control selling, general and administrative expenses.\nAdjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nWe view Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share as important indicators of performance. We define Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. as net income (loss) attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. before transaction costs, intangible amortization, change in fair value of contingent consideration, loss on impairment and other expense (income), all of which are then adjusted for an allocation to the non-controlling interest of OneWater Marine Holdings, LLC. Each of these adjustments are subsequently adjusted for income tax at an estimated effective tax rate. Management also reports adjusted diluted earnings per share which presents all of the adjustments to net income attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. noted above on a per share basis.\nOur Board of Directors, management team and lenders use Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of unusual or one time charges and other items (such as the change in fair value of contingent consideration, intangible amortization, loss on impairment and transaction costs) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period. We present Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share because we believe they provide useful information regarding the factors and trends affecting our business in addition to measures calculated under GAAP.

The decrease in Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. resulted from the decrease in gross profit, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses and the increases in interest expense - floor plan and interest expense - other, all partially offset by the decrease in income tax expense for the year ended September 30, 2023, each as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.

The increase in Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc. resulted from our 11.9% increase in Dealership same-store sales growth for the year ended September 30, 2022, as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, combined with the results of the 2022 Acquisitions and our ability to increase gross profit margins and control selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share resulted from the increase in Adjusted Net Income Attributable to OneWater Marine Inc., partially offset by the increase in the diluted weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding.\nSeasonality\nOur business, along with the entire boating industry, is highly seasonal, and such seasonality varies by geographic market. With the exception of Florida, we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories, and related floor plan borrowings, in the quarterly periods ending December 31 and March 31. Revenue generated from our dealerships in Florida serves to offset generally lower winter revenue in our other states and enables us to maintain a more consistent revenue stream. The onset of the public boat and recreation shows in January stimulates boat sales and typically allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related floor plan borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. The impact of seasonality on our results of operations could be materially impacted based on the location of our acquisitions. For example, our operations could be substantially more seasonal if we acquire dealer groups that operate in colder regions of the United States. Our business is also subject to weather patterns, which may adversely affect our results of operations. For example, prolonged winter conditions, reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain, may limit access to boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient, thereby curtailing customer demand for our products and services. In addition, unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations. Hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities, as has been the case when Florida and other markets were affected by hurricanes. We believe our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area. Additionally, due to a global pandemic, our seasonal trends may also change as a result of, among other things, location closures, disruptions to the supply chain and inventory availability, manufacturer delays, and cancellation of boat shows. For more information, see Risk Factors-Risks Related to Industry and Competition-Our business, as well as the entire retail marine industry, is highly seasonal, with seasonality varying in different geographic markets and Business-Seasonality.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOneWater Inc. is a holding company with no operations and is the sole managing member of OneWater LLC. OneWater Incs principal asset consists of common units of OneWater LLC. Our earnings and cash flows and ability to meet our obligations under the A&R Credit Facility, and any other debt obligations will depend on the cash flows resulting from the operations of our operating subsidiaries, and the payment of distributions by such subsidiaries. Our A&R Credit Facility and Inventory Financing Facility (described below) contain certain restrictions on distributions or transfers from our operating subsidiaries to their members or unitholders, as applicable, as described in the summaries below under -Debt Agreements-A&R Credit Facility and -Inventory Financing Facility. Accordingly, the operating results of our subsidiaries may not be sufficient for them to make distributions to us. As a result, our ability to make payments under the A&R Credit Facility and any other debt obligations or to declare dividends could be limited.\nOur cash needs are primarily for growth through acquisitions and working capital to support our operations, including new and pre-owned boat and related parts inventories and off-season liquidity. We routinely monitor our cash flow to determine the amount of cash available to complete acquisitions. We monitor our inventories, inventory aging and current market trends to determine our current and future inventory and related floorplan financing needs. Based on current facts and circumstances, we believe we will have adequate cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facilities and proceeds from any future public or private issuances of debt or equity to fund our current operations, to make share repurchases and to fund essential capital expenditures and acquisitions for the next twelve months and beyond.\nCash needs for acquisitions have historically been financed with our Credit Facilities and cash generated from operations. Our ability to utilize the A&R Credit Facility to fund acquisitions depends upon Adjusted EBITDA and compliance with covenants of the A&R Credit Facility. Cash needs for inventory have historically been financed with our Inventory Financing Facility. Our ability to fund inventory purchases and operations depends on the collateral levels and our compliance with the covenants of the Inventory Financing Facility. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the A&R Credit Facility and the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility.\nCash Flows\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Year Ended September 30, 2023 and 2022\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDescription 2023 2022 Change\n($ in thousands, unaudited)\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities $ (129,760) $ 7,447 $ (137,207)\nNet cash used in investing activities (51,601) (476,844) 425,243\nNet cash provided by financing activities 213,715 456,403 (242,688)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash 9 (8) 17\nNet change in cash $ 32,363 $ (13,002) $ 45,365\nOperating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities was $129.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The $137.2 million increase in cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $191.7 million decrease in net income in addition to a $65.1 million increase in the change in inventory, partially offset by a $147.4 million increase in loss on impairment for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $51.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to $476.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The $425.2 million decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a $430.7 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $213.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2023 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $456.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022. The $242.7 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $382.5 million decrease in proceeds of long term debt, partially offset by a $66.8 million increase in net borrowing from our Inventory Financing Facility and a $69.7 million decrease in payments on long-term debt for the year ended September 30, 2023 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2022.\nAnalysis of Cash Flow Changes Between the Year Ended September 30, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended September 30,\nDescription 2022 2021 Change\n($ in thousands, unaudited)\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 7,447 $ 159,423 $ (151,976)\nNet cash used in investing activities (476,844) (117,130) (359,714)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 456,403 (36,497) 492,900\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and restricted cash (8) - $ (8)\nNet change in cash $ (13,002) $ 5,796 $ (18,798)\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $159.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The $152.0 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a $192.5 million increase in the change in inventory, partially offset by a $36.2 million increase in net income for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $476.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to $117.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The $359.7 million increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily attributable to a $352.1 million increase in cash used in acquisitions for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $456.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $36.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2021. The $492.9 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to a $176.4 million increase in net borrowings on our Inventory Financing Facility and a $382.5 million increase in proceeds on long-term debt, partially offset by $79.2 million increase in payments on long-term debt for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $50 million of outstanding shares of Class A common stock. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may be made at any time or from time to time, without prior notice, in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices, or such other means as will comply with applicable state and federal securities laws and regulations, including the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including Rule 10b5-1 and, to the extent practicable or advisable, Rule 10b-18 thereunder, and consistent with the Companys contractual limitations and other requirements. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 63,353 shares at an average price of $24.91 per share. The Company has $48.1 million remaining under the share repurchase program.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which was signed into law in August 2022, imposes a 1%, non-deductible excise tax on certain repurchases of common stock that occur after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the tax to have a material effect on our business.\nDebt Agreements\nA&R Credit Facility\nOn August 9, 2022 we entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the A&R Credit Facility), with certain of our subsidiaries, Truist Bank and the other lenders party thereto. The A&R Credit Facility amends and restates and replaces in its entirety the Credit Facility. The A&R Credit Facility provides for, among other things, (i) a $65.0 million revolving credit facility (including up to $5.0 million in swingline loans and up to $5.0 million in letters of credit from time to time) and (ii) a $445.0 million term loan facility. Subject to certain conditions, the available amount under the Term Facility and the Revolving Facility may be increased by $125.0 million plus additional amounts subject to additional conditions (including satisfaction of a consolidated leverage ratio requirement) in the aggregate (with up to $50.0 million allocable to the Revolving Facility). The Revolving Facility matures on August 9, 2027. The Term Facility is repayable in installments beginning on December 31, 2022, with the remainder due on the earlier of (i) August 9, 2027 or (ii) the date on which the principal amount of all outstanding term loans have been declared or automatically have become due and payable pursuant to the terms of the A&R Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the A&R Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either (a) a base rate (the Base Rate) equal to the highest of (i) the prime rate (as announced by Truist Bank from time to time), (ii) the Federal Funds Rate, as in effect from time to time, plus 0.50%, (iii) Term SOFR (as defined in the A&R Credit Facility) for a one-month Interest Period (calculated on a daily basis after taking into account a floor equal to 0.00%) plus 1.00%, and (iv) 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75%, or (b) Term SOFR, plus an applicable margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.75%. Interest on swingline loans shall bear interest at the Base Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75%. All applicable interest margins are based on certain consolidated leverage ratio measures.\nThe A&R Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants including the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The A&R Credit Facility also contains non-financial covenants and restrictive provisions that, among other things, limit the ability of the Loan Parties (as defined in the A&R Credit Facility) to incur additional debt, transfer or dispose of all of their respective assets, make certain investments, loans or restricted payments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The A&R Credit Facility also includes events of default, borrowing conditions, representations and warranties and provisions regarding indemnification and expense reimbursement. The Company was in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2023.\nInventory Financing Facility\nOn November 14, 2023, the Company entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Inventory Financing Facility), which amended and restated the Seventh Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement (the \"Seventh Inventory Financing Facility\") on substantially similar terms to, among other things, increase the maximum borrowing amount available to $650.0 million. Loans under the Inventory Financing Facility may be extended from time to time to enable the Company to purchase inventory from certain manufacturers. The Inventory Financing Facility expires on March 1, 2026.\nThe Company had previously entered into the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility on December 29, 2021, which provided for a maximum borrowing amount of $500.0 million, and which was further amended on February 24, 2022, April 1, 2022, August 9, 2022, and February 14, 2023 by the First, Second, Third and Fourth Amendments to the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility, respectively. Such amendments joined various subsidiaries of the Company to the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility in connection with certain acquisitions made by the Company, increased the Funded Debt to EBIDTA Ratio (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility), and increased the maximum borrowing amount available under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility to $550.0 million.\nUnder the Inventory Financing Facility, interest on new boats and for rental units is calculated using the Adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 5.00% depending on the age of the inventory. Interest on pre-owned boats is calculated at the new boat rate plus 0.25%. Loans are extended from time to time to enable us to purchase inventory from certain manufacturers and to lease certain boats and related parts to customers. The applicable financial terms, curtailment schedule and maturity for each loan are set forth in separate program terms letters that are entered into from time to time. The collateral for the Inventory Financing Facility consists primarily of our inventory that was financed through the Inventory Financing Facility and related assets, including accounts receivable, bank accounts, and proceeds of the foregoing, and excludes the collateral that secures the A&R Credit Facility.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants under the Inventory Financing Facility, including certain provisions related to the Funded Debt to EBITDA Ratio, and the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility). We are also subject to additional restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to (i) use, sell, rent or otherwise dispose of any collateral securing the Inventory Financing Facility except for the sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business, (ii) incur certain liens, (iii) engage in any material transaction not in the ordinary course of business, (iv) change our business in any material manner or our organizational structure, other than as otherwise provided for in the Inventory Financing Facility, (v) engage in certain mergers or consolidations, (vi) acquire certain assets or ownership interests of any other person or entities, except for certain permitted acquisitions, (vii) guarantee or indemnify or otherwise become in any way liable with respect to certain obligations of any other person or entity, except as provided by the Inventory Financing Facility, (viii) redeem, retire, purchase or otherwise acquire, directly or indirectly, any of the equity of our acquired marine retailers (ix) make any change in any of our marine retailers capital structure or in any of their business objectives or operations which might in any way adversely affect the ability of such marine retailer to repay its obligations under the Inventory Financing Facility, (x) incur, create, assume, guarantee or otherwise become or remain liable with respect to certain indebtedness, and (xi) make certain payments of subordinated debt. OneWater LLC and certain of its subsidiaries are restricted from, among other things, making cash dividends or distributions without the prior written consent of Wells Fargo. Under the Inventory Financing Facility, among other exceptions, OneWater LLC may make distributions to its members for certain permitted tax payments subject to certain financial ratios, may make scheduled payments on certain subordinated debt, may make distributions to the Company for repurchases of the Company's common stock subject to certain financial ratios, and is permitted to make pro rata distributions to the OneWater Unit Holders, including OneWater Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow OneWater Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. OneWater LLCs subsidiaries are generally restricted from making loans or advances to OneWater LLC. Our Chief Executive Officer, Philip Austin Singleton, Jr., and our President and Chief Operating Officer, Anthony Aisquith, provide certain personal guarantees of the Inventory Financing Facility.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, our indebtedness associated with financing our inventory under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility totaled $489.0 million and $267.1 million, respectively. Certain of our manufacturers enter into independent agreements with the lenders to the Inventory Financing Facility, which results in a lower effective interest rate charged to us for borrowings related to the products by such manufacturer. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the effective interest rate on the outstanding short-term borrowings under the Inventory Financing Facility was 5.7% and 2.2%, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, our additional available borrowings under our Inventory Financing Facility were $61.0 million and $232.9 million, respectively, based upon the outstanding borrowings and the maximum facility amount. The aging of our inventory limits our borrowing capacity as defined curtailments reduce the allowable advance rate as our inventory ages. As of September 30, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Inventory Financing Facility.\nNotes Payable\nAcquisition Notes Payable. In connection with certain of our acquisitions of dealer groups, we have entered into notes payable agreements with the acquired entities to finance these acquisitions. As of September 30, 2023, our indebtedness associated with our 2 acquisition notes payable totaled an aggregate of $3.2 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.0% per annum. As of September 30, 2023, the principal amount outstanding under these acquisition notes payable ranged from $1.1 million to $2.1 million, and the maturity dates ranged from December 1, 2023 to December 1, 2024.\nCommercial Vehicles Notes Payable. Since 2015, we have entered into multiple notes payable with various commercial lenders in connection with our acquisition of certain vehicles utilized in our retail operations. Such notes bear interest ranging from 0.0% to 10.8% per annum, require monthly payments of approximately $122,000, and mature on dates between November 2023 to September 2028. As of September 30, 2023, we had $3.6 million outstanding under the commercial vehicles notes payable.\nContractual Obligations\nThe table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are contractually obligated to make based on agreements in place at September 30, 2023.\nPayments Due by Period\nLess than 1\nyear 1 - 3 years 3 - 5 years More than 5\nyears Total\n(in thousands)\nA&R Credit Facility(1) $ 27,813 $ 77,875 $ 352,625 $ - $ 458,313\nSeventh Inventory Financing Facility(2) 489,024 - - - 489,024\nNotes Payable(3) 3,411 3,077 339 - 6,827\nEstimated interest payments(4) 33,665 59,495 23,233 - 116,393\nOperating lease obligations(5) 20,898 38,802 34,496 84,388 178,584\nTotal $ 574,811 $ 179,249 $ 410,693 $ 84,388 $ 1,249,141\n__________________________________\n(1)Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the A&R Credit Facility discussed above under -Debt Agreements-A&R Credit Facility.\n(2)Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the Inventory Financing Facility discussed above under -Debt Agreements-Inventory Financing Facility.

Payments are generally made as required pursuant to the terms of the relevant notes payable and as discussed above under -Debt Agreements-Notes Payable.\n(4)Estimated interest payments based on the outstanding principal and stated interest rates on the A&R Credit Facility and Notes Payable.\n(5)Includes certain physical facilities and equipment that we lease under noncancelable operating leases.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe Tax Receivable Agreement generally provides for the payment by OneWater Inc. to each TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax (computed using the estimated impact of state and local taxes) that OneWater Inc. actually realizes (or is deemed to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after the IPO as a result of certain tax basis increases and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest. OneWater Inc. will retain the benefit of the remaining net cash savings.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, our liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement was $43.1 million and $46.4 million, respectively. To the extent OneWater LLC has available cash and subject to the terms of any current or future debt or other agreements, the OneWater LLC Agreement will require OneWater LLC to make pro rata cash distributions to TRA Holders, including OneWater Inc., in an amount sufficient to allow OneWater Inc. to pay its taxes and to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We generally expect OneWater LLC to fund such distributions out of available cash. However, except in cases where OneWater Inc. elects to terminate the Tax Receivable Agreement early, the Tax Receivable Agreement is terminated early due to certain mergers or other changes of control or OneWater Inc. has available cash but fails to make payments when due, generally OneWater Inc. may elect to defer payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement if it does not have available cash to satisfy its payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement or if its contractual obligations limit its ability to make these payments. Any such deferred payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement generally will accrue interest. In certain cases, payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits, if any, OneWater Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement. In the case of such an acceleration, where applicable, we generally expect the accelerated payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement to be funded out of the proceeds of the change of control transaction giving rise to such acceleration. OneWater Inc. intends to account for any amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no material off balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases and purchase commitments under supply agreements entered into in the normal course of business.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur Inventory Financing Facility exposes us to risks caused by fluctuations in interest rates. The interest rate on our Inventory Financing Facility for major unit inventory is calculated using SOFR plus an applicable margin. Based on an outstanding balance under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility of $489.0 million as of September 30, 2023, a change of 100 basis points in the underlying interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $4.9 million. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure. This hypothetical increase does not take into account a corresponding increase to the programs that we may receive from our manufacturers or managements ability to curtail inventory and related floor plan balances, both of which would reduce the impact of the interest rate increase.\nOur A&R Credit Facility exposes us to risks caused by fluctuations in interest rates. The interest rate on our A&R Credit Facility is calculated using Term SOFR (with a 0.00% floor) plus an applicable margin. Based on an outstanding balance of $428.3 million and Term SOFR as of September 30, 2023, a change of 100 basis points in the underlying interest rate would cause a change in interest expense of approximately $4.3 million. We do not currently hedge our interest rate exposure.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe purchase certain of our new boat and parts inventories from foreign manufacturers and some of these transactions are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Our business is subject to foreign exchange rate risk that may influence manufacturers ability to provide their products at competitive prices in the United States. From time to time we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen, but not completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. To the extent that we cannot recapture this volatility in prices charged to customers or if this volatility negatively impacts consumer demand for our products, this volatility could adversely affect our future operating results.

(a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion.\nBasis for opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Distribution Goodwill and Distribution Tradenames\nAs described in notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The Company first assesses qualitative factors to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as the basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform quantitative goodwill and indefinite-lived impairment tests. The Company may bypass the qualitative assessment in any period and proceed directly with a quantitative analysis. For the annual impairment testing date of August 31, 2023, management performed a qualitative assessment and then decided to prepare quantitative impairment analyses for reporting units and trade names. The Company engaged a third-party valuation specialist for the estimation of the fair values of the reporting units and the Distribution trade names. Management estimates the fair value of reporting units using a combination of income and market approaches and Distribution trade names using the relief from royalty approach. As a result of the Companys annual impairment testing, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $57.7 million associated with its Distribution reporting segment and trade name impairment charges of $36.5 million related to the Distribution reporting segment. We identified the estimation of the fair values of Distribution reportable unit and Distribution trade names as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the estimation of the fair values of the Distribution reporting unit and Distribution trade names is a critical audit matter is that there was high estimation uncertainty due to significant judgements with respect to assumptions used to project future cash flows, including revenue growth rates (reporting unit and trade names), EBITDA (reporting unit), as well as the discount rates (reporting unit), royalty rates (trade names), and the valuation methodologies used by the third-party valuation specialist.\nOur audit procedures related to the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit and trade names included the following, among others.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls relating to the Companys review of the assumptions used to project future cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount rates and royalty rates, the valuation methodologies applied by the third-party valuation specialist and the review of the Companys reporting units.\nWe utilized an internal valuation specialist to evaluate:\n\u25e6the methodologies used and whether they were acceptable for the underlying assets or operations and applied correctly by performing independent calculations,\n\u25e6the reasonableness of the risk-adjusted discount rates by recalculating the weighted average cost of capital,\n\u25e6the reasonableness of selected royalty rates considering external information used in developing managements estimate,\n\u25e6the guideline public companies and transactions utilized by the Company by examining financial metrics of the comparable public companies and transactions within the industry and considering market participant guidance and perspective, and\n\u25e6the qualifications of the third-party valuation firm engaged by the Company based on their credentials and experience.\nWe evaluated managements determination of reporting units.\nWe tested the reconciliation of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units to the market capitalization of the Company.\nWe tested the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the estimate by agreeing to underlying accounting records.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the forecasted cash flows, including revenue growth rates, EBITDA, and EBITDA margins, by assessing the historical accuracy of managements estimates and the reasonableness of assumptions used by management by comparing to publicly available industry information and comparable companies, including analyzing the sensitivity of changes in significant assumptions and the resulting impact to the estimated fair values.\nImpairment of Distribution Segment long-lived intangible assets\nAs described in notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of August 31, 2023, the Company recorded impairment charges of $38.3 million and $8.3 million associated with customer relationships and developed technologies, respectively, in its Distribution reportable segment. We identified the estimation of fair value of these long-lived intangible assets as a critical audit matter.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that the estimation of fair values of the Distribution reportable segment long-lived intangible assets is a critical audit matter is due to the high degree of subjectivity used to project future revenue growth rates, gross margin needed to estimate the recoverability of the underlying asset groups, and to assess the fair value of the intangible assets that indicated they were not recoverable using a relevant income approach. The significant assumptions include the revenue growth rates, EBITDA, royalty rate, customer attrition rates, and the discount rate used.\nOur audit procedures related to the fair value of Distribution segment long-lived intangible assets included the following, among others.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Companys relevant controls to fair value long-lived intangible assets, including the Companys controls over the selection and review of the appropriateness of revenue growth rates, EBITDA, royalty rates, customer attrition rates, and the discount rate used in determining fair value.\nWe utilized an internal valuation specialist to evaluate:\n\u25e6the methodologies used and whether they were acceptable for the underlying assets or operations and applied correctly by performing independent calculations,\n\u25e6the reasonableness of the risk-adjusted discount rates by recalculating the weighted average cost of capital,\n\u25e6the reasonableness of selected royalty rates and customer attrition rates considering the external information used in developing managements estimate,\n\u25e6the guideline public companies and transactions utilized by the Company by examining financial metrics of the comparable public companies and transactions within the industry and considering market participant guidance and perspective, and\n\u25e6the qualifications of the third-party valuation firm engaged by the Company based on their credentials and experience.\nWe agreed the carrying value of each asset group to the underlying accounting records.\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the forecasted cash flows, including revenue growth rates, EBITDA, and EBITDA margins, by assessing the historical accuracy of managements estimates and the reasonableness of assumptions used by management by comparing to publicly available industry information and comparable companies, including analyzing the sensitivity of changes in significant assumptions and the resulting impact to the estimated fair values.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2017.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 14, 2023\nONEWATER MARINE INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n($ in thousands, except par value and share data)\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash $ 84,648 $ 42,071\nRestricted cash 8,662 18,876\nAccounts receivable, net 113,175 57,960\nInventories, net 609,616 372,959\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 65,798 75,024\nTotal current assets 881,899 566,890\nProperty and equipment, net 81,532 109,713\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 135,667 123,955\nOther long-term assets 6,069 3,378\nDeferred tax assets, net 35,066 8,433\nIntangible assets, net 212,324 306,471\nGoodwill 336,602 378,588\nTotal assets $ 1,689,159 $ 1,497,428\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccounts payable $ 27,113 $ 27,306\nOther payables and accrued expenses 54,826 55,237\nCustomer deposits 51,649 65,460\nNotes payable -

Description of Company and Basis of Presentation\nDescription of the Business\nOneWater Marine Inc. (OneWater Inc) was incorporated in Delaware on April 3, 2019 and was a wholly-owned subsidiary of One Water Marine Holdings, LLC (OneWater LLC). Pursuant to a reorganization on February 11, 2020 into a holding company structure for the purpose of facilitating an initial public offering (the IPO) and related transactions in order to carry on the business of OneWater LLC and its subsidiaries (together with OneWater Inc, the Company), OneWater Inc is the holding company and its sole material asset is the equity interest in OneWater LLC. OneWater LLC was organized as a limited liability company under the law of the State of Delaware in 2014 and is the parent company of One Water Assets & Operations (OWAO), and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company is one of the largest recreational marine retailers in the United States. The Company engages primarily in the retail sale, brokerage, and service of new and pre-owned boats, motors, trailers, the sale of marine parts and accessories, and offers slip and storage accommodations in certain locations. The Company also arranges related boat financing, insurance, and extended service contracts for customers with third-party lenders and insurance companies. As of September 30, 2023, the Company operates a total of 98 retail locations, 11 distribution centers/warehouses and multiple online marketplaces in 19 states, several of which are in the top twenty states for marine retail expenditures.\nOperating results are generally subject to seasonal variations. Demand for products is generally highest during the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year and, accordingly, revenues are generally expected to be higher during these periods. General economic conditions and consumer spending patterns can negatively impact the Companys operating results. Unfavorable local, regional, national, or global economic developments, global public health concerns, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or uncertainties could reduce consumer spending and adversely affect the Companys business. Consumer spending on discretionary goods may also decline as a result of lower consumer confidence levels, even if prevailing economic conditions are otherwise favorable. Economic conditions in areas in which the Company operates, particularly in the Southeast, can have a major impact on the Companys overall results of operations. Local influences such as corporate downsizing, inclement weather such as hurricanes and other storms, environmental conditions, and other events could adversely affect the Companys operations in certain markets and in certain periods. Any extended period of adverse economic conditions or low consumer confidence is likely to have a negative effect on the Companys business.\nSales of new boats from the Companys top ten brands represent approximately 39.4%, 41.8% and 42.9% of total sales for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, making them major suppliers of the Company. Of this amount, Malibu Boats, Inc, including its brands Malibu, Axis, Cobalt, Pursuit, Maverick, Hewes, Cobia and Pathfinder accounted for 13.9%, 15.6% and 17.0% of our consolidated revenue for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As is typical in the industry, the Company contracts with most manufacturers under renewable annual dealer agreements, each of which provides the right to sell various makes and models of boats within a given geographic region. Any change or termination of these agreements, or the agreements discussed above, for any reason, or changes in competitive, regulatory, or marketing practices, including rebate or incentive programs, could adversely affect results of operations. Pre-owned boats are usually trade-ins from retail customers who are purchasing a boat from the Company.\nSeptember Offering\nOn September 22, 2020, OneWater Inc completed an underwritten public offering (the September Offering) of 3,170,868 shares of Class A common stock, at a public offering price of $20.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. OneWater Inc sold 425,000 shares of Class A common stock, and certain stockholders of the Company (the Selling Stockholders) sold 2,745,868 shares of Class A common stock. In connection with the September Offering, Goldman granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional 475,630 shares of the Companys Class A common stock (the Optional Shares). On September 29, 2020, the underwriters notified OneWater Inc and Goldman of their intent to purchase an additional 387,458 Optional Shares. The sale of the Optional Shares closed on October 2, 2020. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the Optional Shares or the Class A common stock sold by Selling Stockholders.\nAfter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, OneWater Inc received net proceeds of $8.1 million. OneWater Inc contributed all of the net proceeds of the September Offering received to OneWater LLC in exchange for LLC Units. OneWater LLC used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAs the sole managing member of OneWater LLC, OneWater Inc. operates and controls all of the businesses and affairs of OneWater LLC. Through OneWater LLC and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as majority-owned subsidiaries over which the Company exercises control, OneWater Inc. conducts its business. As a result, OneWater Inc consolidates the financial results of OneWater LLC and its subsidiaries and reports non-controlling interests related to the portion of units of OneWater LLC (the OneWater LLC Units) not owned by OneWater Inc, which will reduce net (loss) income attributable to OneWater Incs Class A stockholders. As of September 30, 2023, OneWater Inc owned 91.0% of the economic interest of OneWater LLC.\nCommencing December 31, 2021, the Company owns 80% of the economic interest of Quality Assets and Operations, LLC, over which the Company exercises control and the minority interest in this subsidiary has been recorded accordingly. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the acquisition.\nBasis of Financial Statement Preparation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). All adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments considered by management to be necessary for fair presentation, have been reflected in these consolidated financial statements.\nAll intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company operates on a fiscal year basis with the first day of the fiscal year being October 1, and the last day of the fiscal year ending on September 30.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash\nAt times the amount of cash on deposit may exceed the federally insured limit of the bank. Deposit accounts at each of the institutions are insured up to $250,000 by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company exceeded FDIC limits at various institutions. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes there is little to no exposure to any significant credit risk.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash relates to amounts collected for pre-owned sales, in certain states, which are held in escrow on behalf of the respective buyers and sellers for future purchases of boats. Total customers deposits are shown as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets. These liabilities may be more than the applicable restricted cash balances and fluctuate due to timing differences and because in certain states the deposits are not restricted from use.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of the new and pre-owned boat inventory is determined using the specific identification method. In assessing lower of cost or net realizable value, the Company considers the aging of the boats, historical sales of a brand and current market conditions. The cost of acquired, manufactured and assembled parts and accessories is determined using methods which vary by subsidiary and include both the average cost method and first-in, first-out (FIFO).\nVendor Consideration Received\nConsideration received from vendors is accounted for in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 330, \u2018\u2018Inventory (\u2018\u2018ASC 330). Pursuant to ASC 330, manufacturer incentives based upon cumulative volume of sales and purchases are recorded as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales when the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease period or the estimated useful lives. The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:\nYears\nCompany vehicles 5\nBuildings and improvements 10-39\nMachinery and equipment 5-7\nOffice equipment 5-7\nExpenditures for major improvements that extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. Minor replacements, maintenance and repairs which do not extend the useful life of an asset are expensed as incurred.\nThe carrying value of property and equipment and other long-term assets (other than goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets) is evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If such an indication is present, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated undiscounted cash flows related to that asset. The Company would conclude that an asset may be impaired if the sum of such undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the related asset. If an asset is impaired, the impairment loss would be the amount by which the carrying amount of the related asset exceeds its fair value. We did not record an impairment of our property and equipment in fiscal years 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nGoodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with FASB ASC 350, \u2018\u2018Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (\u2018\u2018ASC 350), which provides that the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired, including other identifiable intangible assets, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is an asset representing operational synergies and future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. In accordance with ASC 350, Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred. ASC 350 also states for annual impairment tests that if an entity determines, based on an assessment of certain qualitative factors, that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is unnecessary. The Company performs its annual test in the fiscal fourth quarter.\nIn evaluating goodwill for impairment, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference would represent the amount of required goodwill impairment. The Company calculates the fair value of its reporting units by considering both the income and market approach. The income approach calculates the fair value of the reporting unit using a discounted cash flow method. Fair value under the market approach is determined for each unit by applying market multiples for comparable public companies to the unit's financial results.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023 the Company determined that there were circumstances that indicated impairment may have occurred, including a drop in the Company's market capitalization and declining margins, and performed a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis. As a result, the Company recognized a $57.7 million impairment for goodwill for the year then ended. See Note 8 for more information about the impairment of goodwill. The Company elected a qualitative assessment for our fiscal fourth quarter 2022 goodwill impairment testing and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts, and as a result, no impairment for goodwill was required for the year then ended.\nIdentifiable intangible assets primarily consist of trade names, developed technologies, including design libraries, and customer relationships related to the acquisitions the Company has completed. The Company has determined that trade names have an indefinite life, as there are no economic, contractual or other factors that limit their useful lives and they are expected to generate value as long as the trade name is utilized by the Company, and therefore, are not subject to amortization. Developed technologies and customer relationships are amortized over their estimated useful lives of ten years and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\nFinancial statement risk exists to the extent identifiable intangibles become impaired due to the decrease in their fair value. The Company first performs an annual qualitative impairment assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values are greater than their carrying amounts. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair values of the intangible assets are less than their respective carrying amounts, the Company then performs a quantitative impairment analysis by comparing the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible assets to the fair values. To determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses a relief from royalty method for trade names.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC 360-10, \"Property, Plant and Equipment - Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\" (ASC 360), the Company assesses the potential for impairment of its definite-lived assets if facts and circumstances, such as declines in sales, earnings, cash flows or adverse changes in the business climate, suggest that they may be impaired. The Company performs its assessment by comparing the book value of the asset groups to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset groups. If any impairment in the carrying value of its definite-lived assets is indicated, the assets would be adjusted to an estimate of fair value. To determine the fair value of the definite-lived intangible assets, the Company uses a relief from royalty method for developed technology and discounted cash flows method for customer relationships.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023 the Company performed a quantitative impairment analysis. As a result, the Company recognized a $89.7 million impairment for identifiable intangible assets for the year then ended. See Note 8 for more information about the impairment of identifiable intangible assets. The Company elected qualitative assessments for our fiscal fourth quarter 2022 indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing and determined that it was more likely than not that the fair values of the Companys indefinite-lived intangible assets were greater than their carrying amounts, and as a result, no impairment was required for the year then ended. Additionally, there were no events or circumstances as of September 30, 2022 that indicated that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nSoftware Development and Cloud Computing Arrangement Implementation Costs\nThe Company capitalizes cost for software developed or obtained for internal use, including domain names and internally developed software, and amortizes them over their estimated useful life, which is generally three to five years. The Company begins to capitalize costs incurred for computer software during the application development stage, as long as it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for its intended purpose. Capitalization ceases when a software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use.\nThe Company capitalizes qualifying implementation costs under cloud computing arrangements (CCA). Capitalization ceases once the software is ready for its intended use. The capitalized CCA implementation cost is allocated between Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other long-term assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based on the expected amortization to be recognized within one year. The total capitalized CCA implementation costs was $5.4 million and $1.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded $0.1 million of expense in Selling, general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to the amortization of CCA implementation costs. No expense related to the amortization of CCA implementation costs was recorded during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nSales Tax\nThe Company collects sales tax on all of the Companys sales to nonexempt customers and remits the entire amount to the states that imposed the sales tax. The Companys accounting policy is to exclude the tax collected and remitted to the states from revenues and cost of sales.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized from the sale of products and commissions earned on new and pre-owned boats (including used, brokerage, consignment and wholesale) when ownership is transferred to the customer, which is generally upon acceptance or delivery to the customer. At the time of acceptance or delivery, the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits at such time. We are the principal with respect to revenue from new, pre-owned and consignment sales and such revenue is recorded at the gross sales price. With respect to brokerage transactions, we are acting as an agent in the transaction, therefore the fee or commission is recorded on a net basis.\nRevenue from parts and accessories sold directly to a customer (not on a repair order) are recognized when control of the item is transferred to the customer, which is typically upon shipment. Revenue from parts and service operations (boat maintenance and repairs) are recorded over time as services are performed. Satisfaction of this performance obligation creates an asset with no alternative use for which an enforceable right to payment for performance to date exists within our contractual agreements. Each boat maintenance and repair service is a single performance obligation that includes both the parts and labor associated with the service. Payment for boat maintenance and repairs is typically due upon the completion of the service, which is generally completed within a period of one year or less from contract inception. The Company recorded contract assets in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $4.4 million and $3.7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nCertain parts and service transactions require the Company to perform shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to delivery). They are considered fulfillment activities and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRevenue from storage and marina operations is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract as services are completed. Revenue from arranging financing, insurance and extended warranty contracts to customers through various third-party financial institutions and insurance companies is recognized when the related boats are sold. We do not directly finance our customers boat, motor or trailer purchases. We are acting as an agent in the transaction, therefore the commissions are recorded on a net basis. Subject to our agreements and in the event of early cancellation, prepayment or default of such loans or insurance contracts by the customer, we may be assessed a chargeback for a portion of the commission paid by the third-party financial institutions and insurance companies. We reserve for these chargebacks based on our historical experience with repayments or defaults. Chargebacks were not material to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenues from marina and storage operations and customer deposits and are classified in Customer deposits in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Deposits received from customers are recorded as a liability until the related sales orders have been fulfilled by us and control of the vessel is transferred to the customer. The activity in customer deposits for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022\nBeginning contract liability $ 65,460 $ 46,610\nRevenue recognized from contract liabilities included in the beginning balance (63,207) (43,777)\nIncreases due to business combinations and cash received, net of amounts recognized in revenue during the period 49,396 62,627\nEnding contract liability $ 51,649 $ 65,460\nThe following table sets forth percentages on the timing of revenue recognition for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021:\n2023 2022 2021\nGoods and services transferred at a point in time 93.8 % 94.4 % 93.9 %\nGoods and services transferred over time 6.2 % 5.6 % 6.1 %\nTotal Revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nAdvertising Costs\nWe expense advertising and promotional costs as incurred and include them in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Pursuant to FASB ASC 606, \u2018\u2018Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u2018\u2018ASC 606), we net amounts received under our co-op assistance programs from our manufacturers against the related advertising expenses. Total advertising costs for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, were $24.8 million, $13.4 million and $4.5 million, which are net of related co-op assistance of $2.2 million, $1.8 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nEquity-based compensation plans are accounted for following the provisions of FASB ASC 718, \u2018\u2018Compensation - Stock Compensation (\u2018\u2018ASC 718). Equity-based awards are designed to reward employees for their long-term contributions to the Company and to provide incentives for them to remain with the Company. Valuation models and the quoted market price of our common stock are used to value all equity-based compensation. Compensation for awards is measured at fair value on the grant date based on the number of shares expected to vest. The Company recognizes compensation cost for all awards on a graded basis over the requisite service period of the award.\nIncome Taxes\nOneWater Inc is a corporation and as a result, is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities on the basis of the differences between the book value and tax bases of assets and liabilities by using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which the enactment date occurs. We recognize deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized. In making such a determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations.\nOneWater LLC is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and therefore does not pay U.S. federal income tax on its taxable income. Instead, the OneWater LLC members are liable for U.S. federal income tax on their respective shares of the Companys taxable income reported on the members U.S. federal income tax returns.\nWhen there are situations with uncertainty as to the timing of the deduction, the amount of the deduction, or the validity of the deduction, the Company adjusts the financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that are more-likely-than-not to be sustained. Positions that meet this criterion are measured using the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are included in the benefit (provision) for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.\nLoan costs\nThe Company accounts for its loan costs in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, \u2018\u2018Interest-Imputation Subtopic (835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction of the carrying amount of that debt liability.\nLoan costs are amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the loan, which approximates the effective interest method.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of any revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant estimates made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, those relating to inventory mark downs, certain assumptions related to intangible and long-lived assets and valuation of contingent consideration.\nSegment Information\nEffective August 9, 2022, our reportable segments changed as a result of the Companys acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc., and Star Brite Europe, Inc (collectively Ocean Bio-Chem), which changed managements reporting structure and operating activities. We now report our operations through two reportable segments: Dealerships and Distribution. The Dealership segment engages in the sale of new and pre-owned boats, arranges financing and insurance products, performs repairs and maintenance services, offers marine related parts and accessories and offers slip and storage accommodations in certain locations. The Distribution segment engages in the manufacturing, assembly and distribution primarily of marine related products to distributors, big box retailers and online retailers through a network of warehouse and distribution centers. Each reporting segment has discrete financial information and is regularly reviewed by the Companys chief operating decision maker (CODM) to assess performance and allocate resources. The Company has identified its Chief Executive Officer as its CODM. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Companys previously reported historical consolidated financial statements.\n3. New Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which is intended to improve the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to the recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The pronouncement is effective for a public companys annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. The Company plans to adopt the pronouncement in fiscal year 2024.\nOther than as noted above, there are no new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n4. Acquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nIn the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company completed acquisitions of multiple businesses. The results of operations of acquisitions are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date. The purchase price of acquisitions was allocated to identifiable tangible assets and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess being allocated to goodwill. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the information currently available. Any changes to the value of identifiable intangible assets are reclassified from goodwill upon the completion of the valuations.\nThe fair values of the developed technology and trade name intangible assets as of the acquisition date were determined using the relief from royalty model. The fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets as of the acquisition date were determined using the discounted cash flow method.\nFiscal Year 2023\nFor the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company completed the following transactions:\nOn October 1, 2022, Taylor Marine Centers, a retail marine dealership with locations in Maryland and Delaware\nOn December 1, 2022, Harbor View Marine, a retail marine dealership with locations in Florida and Alabama\nOn September 1, 2023, Harbor Pointe Marina, a retail marine dealership with one location in Alabama\nConsideration paid for the consummated acquisitions was $42.0 million with $28.9 million paid at closing (net of cash acquired), $10.6 million in non-cash financing and the remaining $2.6 million in estimated payments of contingent consideration. The payments of contingent consideration are part of earnouts from the achievement of certain post-acquisition increases in adjusted EBITDA. As of September 30, 2023, the earnout period for the acquisitions was completed and no contingent consideration payout was achieved.\nThe table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, including the goodwill recorded as a result of the transactions:\nSummary of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n($ in thousands) Total Acquisitions\nAccounts receivable $ 286\nInventories 6,424\nPrepaid expenses 72\nProperty and equipment 11,588\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 3,820\nIdentifiable intangible assets 8,800\nGoodwill 18,481\nAccounts payable (17)\nAccrued expenses (361)\nCustomer deposits (1,013)\nNotes payable - floor plan (2,228)\nOperating lease liabilities (3,820)\nAggregate acquisition date fair value $ 42,032\nConsideration transferred 42,032\nIn connection with the acquisition of Harbor View Marine, an entity affiliated with the Company agreed to acquire the real estate for the two acquired locations, in effect providing non-cash financing. The Company has accounted for this transaction as a sale and leaseback of the properties in our consolidated financial statements. There was no gain or loss recorded as part of the transaction. The leases for the two properties include an initial term of 15 years and two, five-year renewal options. The leases are accounted for as operating leases and are included in the Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIncluded in our results for the year ended September 30, 2023, the acquisitions contributed $60.9 million to our consolidated revenue and $6.3 million to our (loss) income before income tax expense. Costs related to acquisitions are included in transaction costs and primarily relate to legal, accounting, valuation and other fees, which are charged directly to operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as incurred in the amount of $1.2 million for the year ended September 30, 2023.\nFiscal Year 2022\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company completed the following transactions:\nOn October 1, 2021, Naples Boat Mart, a retail marine dealership with one location in Florida\nOn November 30, 2021, T-H Marine Supplies, LLC (T-H Marine), a leading provider of branded marine parts and accessories for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the aftermarket, with locations in Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Oklahoma and Texas\nOn December 1, 2021, Norfolk Marine Company, a retail marine dealership with one location in Virginia\nOn December 31, 2021, a majority interest in Quality Boats, a retail marine dealership with three locations in Florida.

The notes are payable in one lump sum on December 1, 2024, with interest payments due quarterly. The estimated payments of contingent consideration are part of multiple earnouts varying from the achievement of certain post-acquisition increases in adjusted EBITDA to the generation of acquisition leads for the Company. The acquisition contingent consideration was developed using weighted average projections based on the Companys historical experience, current forecasts for the industry and current expectations of the ability to generate viable acquisition leads. The minimum payout on acquisition contingent consideration is $5.9 million and the maximum payout is $24.7 million.\nThe table below summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, including the goodwill recorded as a result of the transactions:\nSummary of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed\n($ in thousands) T-H Marine Quality Boats Denison Yachting Ocean Bio-Chem Other Acquisitions Total Acquisitions\nAccounts receivable $ 8,955 $ - $ 654 $ 14,989 $ 1,123 $ 25,721\nInventories 19,856 5,937 1,981 24,362 9,618 61,754\nPrepaid expenses 1,547 47 2,053 1,431 338 5,416\nProperty and equipment 3,896 803 293 32,037 1,227 38,256\nDeposits - - 126 - 13 139\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 5,960 11,877 1,221 762 7,375 27,195\nIdentifiable intangible assets 105,500 31,700 16,600 59,300 11,332 224,432\nGoodwill 51,694 78,682 29,144 35,270 15,307 210,097\nAccounts payable (3,876) - (80) (3,654) (471) (8,081)\nAccrued expenses (1,697) - (252) (1,817) (553) (4,319)\nCustomer deposits (394) (5,047) (5,524) (176) (3,307) (14,448)\nDeferred tax liabilities - - - (20,141) (751) (20,892)\nLong-term debt - - - (8,150) - (8,150)\nOperating lease liabilities (5,960) (11,877) (1,221) (762) (7,375) (27,195)\nAggregate acquisition date fair value $ 185,481 $ 112,122 $ 44,995 $ 133,451 $ 33,876 $ 509,925\nConsideration transferred 185,481 92,811 44,995 135,281 33,876 492,444\nCash acquired - - - (1,829) - (1,829)\nFair value of non-controlling interests - 19,311 - - - 19,311\nAggregate acquisition date fair values $ 185,481 $ 112,122 $ 44,995 $ 133,451 $ 33,876 $ 509,925\nThe fair value of the non-controlling interest of Quality Boats as of the acquisition date was estimated using the discounted cash flow method and market multiple method.

Notes Payable - Floor Plan\nThe Company maintains an ongoing wholesale marine products inventory financing program with a syndicate of banks. The program is administered by Wells Fargo Commercial Distribution Finance, LLC (Wells Fargo). On February 14, 2023, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Fourth Amendment to the Seventh Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement (as amended, the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility\") with Wells Fargo and the other financial institutions party thereto to increase the maximum borrowing amount available under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility to $550.0 million. The Seventh Inventory Financing Facility was set to expire on December 1, 2023. On November 14, 2023 the Company entered into the Eighth Amended and Restated Inventory Financing Agreement to, among other things, increase the maximum borrowing amount available to $650.0 million and extend the term. See Note 20 for additional information regarding the new agreement. The outstanding balance of the facility was $489.0 million and $267.1 million, as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nInterest on new boats and for rental units is calculated using the Adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR (as defined in the Inventory Financing Facility) (SOFR) plus an applicable margin of 2.75% to 5.00% depending on the age of the inventory. Interest on pre-owned boats in calculated at the new boat rate plus 0.25%. Wells Fargo will finance 100.0% of the vendor invoice price for new boats, engines, and trailers. As of September 30, 2023 the interest rate on the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility ranged from 8.18% to 10.43% for new inventory and 8.43% to 10.68% for pre-owned inventory. As of September 30, 2022 the interest rate on the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility ranged from 5.33% to 7.58% for new inventory and 5.58% to 7.83% for pre-owned inventory. Borrowing capacity available at September 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022 was $61.0 million and $232.9 million, respectively.\nThe Seventh Inventory Financing Facility has certain financial and non-financial covenants as specified in the agreement. The financial covenants include requirements to comply with a maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio (as defined in the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility). In addition, certain non-financial covenants could restrict the Companys ability to sell assets (excluding inventory in the normal course of business), engage in certain mergers and acquisitions, incur additional debt and pay cash dividends or distributions, among others. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2023.\nThe collateral for the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility consists primarily of our inventory that is financed through the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility and related assets, including accounts receivable, bank accounts and proceeds of the foregoing, and excludes the collateral that underlies the term note payable to Truist Bank.\n11. Long-term Debt and Line of Credit\nOn August 9, 2022, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the A&R Credit Facility) with Truist Bank. The A&R Credit Facility provides for a $65.0 million revolving credit facility (the A&R Revolving Facility) that may be used for revolving credit loans (including up to $5.0 million in swingline loans and up to $5.0 million in letters of credit) and a $445.0 million term loan (the A&R Term Loan). Subject to certain conditions, the available amount under the revolving credit facility and term loans may be increased by $125.0 million in the aggregate. The A&R Credit Facility bears interest at a rate that is equal to Term SOFR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.75% based on certain consolidated leverage ratio measures. The A&R Revolving Facility matures on August 9, 2027. The A&R Term Loan is repayable in installments beginning December 31, 2022, with the remainder due on August 9, 2027.\nThe A&R Credit Facility is collateralized by certain real and personal property (including certain capital stock) of the Company and its subsidiaries. The collateral does not include inventory and certain other assets of the Companys subsidiaries financed under the Seventh Inventory Financing Facility. The A&R Credit Facility is subject to certain financial covenants related to the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio. The A&R Credit Facility also contains non-financial covenants and restrictive provisions that, among other things, limit the ability of the Company to incur additional debt, transfer or dispose of all of its assets, make certain investments, loans or payments and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2023.\nLong-term debt consisted of the following at:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nTerm note payable to Truist Bank, secured and bearing interest at 7.53% at September 30, 2023 and 5.31% at September 30, 2022.

In connection with entering into the A&R Credit Facility, the Company wrote off unamortized debt issuance cost of $0.4 million which was included in Loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended September 30, 2022. Amortization for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 amounted to $2.2 million, $1.3 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and is included in Interest expense - other in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $0.7 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding under the A&R Revolving Facility.\n12. Stockholders Equity\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe maintain the OneWater Marine Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the LTIP) to incentivize individuals providing services to OneWater Inc and its subsidiaries and affiliates. The LTIP provides for the grant, from time to time, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of OneWater Marine Inc. (the Board of Directors) or a committee thereof, of (1) stock options, (2) stock appreciation rights, (3) restricted stock, (4) restricted stock units, (5) stock awards, (6) dividend equivalents, (7) other stock-based awards, (8) cash awards, (9) substitute awards and (10) performance awards. The total number of shares reserved for issuance under the LTIP that may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options (which generally are stock options that meet the requirements of Section 422 of the Code) is 1,585,007. The LTIP is and will continue to be administered by the Board of Directors, except to the extent the Board of Directors elects a committee of directors to administer the LTIP. Class A common stock subject to an award that expires or is cancelled, forfeited, exchanged, settled in cash or otherwise terminated without delivery of shares (including forfeiture of restricted stock awards) and shares withheld to pay the exercise price of, or to satisfy the withholding obligations with respect to, an award will again be available for delivery pursuant to other awards under the LTIP.\n2023 Awards\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 137,057 time-based restricted stock units. Of this amount, 22,550 restricted stock units fully vest on October 1, 2023 and the remaining 114,507 restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments commencing on October 1, 2023.\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the grant of 88,018 performance-based restricted stock units, which represents 100% of the target award. Performance-based restricted stock units provide an opportunity for the recipient to receive a number of shares of our common stock based on our performance goals. A performance-based restricted stock unit equals one share of common stock to the Company. Of this amount, 13,288 performance-based restricted stock units fully vest on October 1, 2023 and the remaining 74,730 restricted stock units vest in three equal annual installments commencing on October 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company achieved 100% of the performance target for the units fully vesting on October 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2023, the Company achieved 40% of the performance target for the awards with units vesting in three equal annual installments commencing on October 1, 2023.\nCompensation cost for time-based restricted stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately preceding the grant and is recognized on a graded basis over the applicable vesting periods. Compensation cost for performance share units is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date immediately preceding the grant and the ultimate performance level achieved and is recognized on a graded basis over the applicable vesting period. The Company recognized $8.2 million, $9.8 million and $5.7 million of compensation expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which includes $3.5 million, $5.4 million, and $2.6 million of compensation expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for performance-based units.\nThe following table further summarizes activity related to restricted stock units for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\nNumber of Shares Weighted Average\nGrant Date Fair\nValue ($)\nUnvested at September 30, 2021 545,094 $ 22.68\nAwarded 225,924 40.01\nVested (211,225) 27.10\nForfeited - -\nUnvested at September 30, 2022 559,793 28.01\nAwarded 225,075 30.08\nVested (257,082) 27.98\nForfeited (3,001) 35.81\nUnvested at September 30, 2023 524,785 $ 28.86\nAs of September 30, 2023, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to outstanding equity awards was $3.3 million, which the Company expects to recognize over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years.\nWe issue shares of our Class A common stock upon the vesting of performance-based restricted stock units and time-based restricted stock units. These shares are issued from our authorized and not outstanding common stock. In addition, in connection with the vesting of restricted stock units, we repurchase a portion of shares equal to the amount of employee income tax withholding.\nNet (Loss) Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted net (loss) earnings per share of Class A common stock is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to OneWater Inc by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net (loss) earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive shares.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of net (loss) earnings per share for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands, except per share data):\nNet (loss) earnings per share: 2023 2022 2021\nNumerator:\nNet (loss) income attributable to OneWater Inc $ (38,592) $ 130,944 $ 79,059\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average number of unrestricted outstanding common shares used to calculate basic net (loss) income per share 14,328 13,877 11,087\nEffect of dilutive securities:\nRestricted stock units - 457 272\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan - 3 -\nDiluted weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding used to calculate diluted net (loss) income per share 14,328 14,337 11,359\nNet (loss) earnings per share of Class A common stock - basic $ (2.69) $ 9.44 $ 7.13\nNet (loss) earnings per share of Class A common stock - diluted $ (2.69) $ 9.13 $ 6.96\nOn March 30, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program up to $50.0 million. During the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and retired 63,353 shares of Class A common stock under the repurchase program for a purchase price of approximately $1.6 million. As of September 30, 2023 the Company has repurchased and retired 73,487 shares of Class A common stock under the repurchase program for a purchase price of approximately $1.9 million. As of September 30, 2023, approximately $48.1 million remained available for future purchase under the repurchase program. The repurchase program does not have a predetermined expiration date.\nShares of Class B common stock and unvested restricted stock units do not share in the income (losses) of the Company and are therefore not participating securities. As such, separate presentation of basic and diluted net (loss) earnings per share of Class B common stock under the two-class method has not been presented.\nThe following number of weighted-average potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net (loss) earnings per share because the effect of including such potentially dilutive shares would have been antidilutive upon conversion (in thousands):\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, 2023 Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 Year Ended\nSeptember 30, 2021\nClass B common stock 1,430 1,527 3,931\nRestricted stock units 598 219 232\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan 4 - -\n2,032 1,746 4,163\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nAt the Companys 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders (the Annual Meeting), held on February 23, 2021, the Companys stockholders approved the OneWater Marine Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP), which was approved and adopted by the Board of Directors as of January 13, 2021 (the Adoption Date), subject to stockholder approval at the Annual Meeting. The effective date of the ESPP is February 23, 2021, and, unless earlier terminated, the ESPP will expire on the twentieth anniversary of the Adoption Date. The ESPP will be administered by the Board of Directors or by one or more committees to which the Board of Directors delegates such administration.\nThe ESPP enables eligible employees to purchase shares of the Companys Class A common stock at a discount through participation in discrete offering periods. The ESPP is intended to qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Up to a maximum of 449,257 shares of the Companys Class A common stock may be issued under the ESPP, subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the ESPP. On the first day of each fiscal year during the term of the ESPP, beginning on October 1, and ending on (and including) September 30, the number of shares of Class A common stock that may be issued under the ESPP will increase by a number of shares equal to the least of (i) 1% of the outstanding shares on the Adoption Date, or (ii) such lesser number of shares (including zero) that the administrator determines for purposes of the annual increase for that fiscal year. The number of shares of Class A common stock that may be granted to any single participant in any single option period will be subject to certain limitations set forth in the plan.\nThe Company recorded equity-based compensation for the ESPP of $0.7 million and $0.2 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, we had current liabilities of $0.4 million and $0.5 million. respectively, for future purchases of shares under the ESPP. During the year ended September 30, 2023, 86,050 shares were issued under the ESPP at an average price per share of $24.31. No purchases were made under the ESPP during the year ended September 30, 2022.\nWe used a Black-Scholes model to estimate the fair value of the options granted to purchase shares issued pursuant to the ESPP. Volatility is based on the historical volatility in our common stock. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual term of the options is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe following are the assumptions used for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\n2023 2022\nDividend yield 0.0 % 0.0 %\nRisk-free interest rate 4.8 - 5.5%\n2.5 %\nVolatility 37.6 - 45.6%\n57.4 %\nExpected life Six months Six months\nDistributions\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company made distributions to OneWater Unit Holders for certain permitted tax payments.\nDividends\nDividends paid to holders of Class A common stock, distributions paid to OneWater Unit Holders and dividends payable to restricted stock unit holders are referred to herein collectively as dividends. Dividends declared are reported as a reduction of retained earnings. Dividends paid to OneWater Unit Holders are recorded as a reduction in non-controlling interest. On June 17, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $1.80 per share. The cash dividend of approximately $27.1 million was paid on July 19, 2021 to holders of Class A common stock and OneWater Unit Holders. Additionally, a $1.0 million cash dividend for restricted stock unit holders was accrued for payment to holders upon future vesting of restricted stock unit awards outstanding on the date the dividend was declared. During the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of the previously accrued balance was paid to restricted stock unit holders. The remaining $0.5 million is recorded in Other payables and accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2023.\nNon-Controlling Interest\nAs discussed in Note 1, OneWater Inc consolidates the financial results of OneWater LLC and its subsidiaries and reports a non-controlling interest related to the portion of OneWater LLC owned by the holders of OneWater LLC Units (the OneWater Unit Holders). OneWater Unit Holders may exchange their LLC Units, together with an equal number of shares of Class B common stock of OneWater Inc, for shares of Class A common Stock of OneWater Inc on a one-for-one basis or, at OneWater LLCs election, cash. Changes in ownership interest in OneWater LLC, while OneWater Inc retains its controlling interest, will be accounted for as equity transactions. Future direct exchanges of OneWater LLC units will result in a change in ownership and reduce the amount recorded as a non-controlling interest and increase additional paid-in-capital. As of September 30, 2023, OneWater Inc owned 91.0% of the economic interest of OneWater LLC with the OneWater Unit Holders owning the remaining 9.0%.\nAs discussed in Note 4, the Company acquired an 80% economic interest in Quality Boats during the year ended September 30, 2022. The Company has the exclusive right, but not obligation, to acquire the remaining 20% economic interest at any time before January 1, 2027. On November 1, 2023, the Company exercised the right to acquire the remaining 20% economic interest in Quality Boats. See Note 20 for additional information.\n13. Retirement Plan\nThe Company offers a 401(k) retirement plan to its full-time employees over the age of 21. The Company currently makes discretionary matching contributions of 50.0% for the first 4.0% of employee salary deferrals. The Company made discretionary contributions of $2.6 million, $2.2 million and $1.5 million for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n14. Fair Value Measurements\nIn determining fair value, the Company uses various valuation approaches including market, income and/or cost approaches. FASB standard \u2018\u2018Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820) establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are those that reflect the Companys expectation of the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:\nLevel 1 - Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Assets utilizing Level 1 inputs include marketable securities that are actively traded.\nLevel 2 - Valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Asset and liability measurements utilizing Level 3 inputs include those used in estimating fair value of non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities in purchase acquisitions, those used in assessing impairment of property and equipment and other intangibles and those used in the reporting unit valuation in the annual goodwill impairment evaluation and contingent consideration.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary and is affected by a wide variety of factors. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment required in determining fair value is greatest for assets and liabilities categorized in Level 3. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is disclosed is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Fair value measurements can be volatile based on various factors that may or may not be within the Companys control.\nThe following tables summarize the Companys financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30:\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestment in Equity Securities $ 326 $ - $ - $ 326\nLiabilities:\nContingent Consideration - - 21,181 21,181\n($ in thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets:\nInvestment in Equity Securities $ 772 $ - $ - $ 772\nLiabilities:\nContingent Consideration - - 37,402 37,402\nThere were no transfers between the valuation hierarchy Levels 1, 2, and 3 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023, and 2022.\nWe measure all equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value with the change in fair value included in Other expense (income), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of equity investments is measured using quoted prices in its active markets. The investment in equity securities balance is recorded in Other long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheets and consists entirely of our investment in Forza X1, Inc.\nThe portion of unrealized losses recognized related to equity securities still held as of September 30 consists of the following:\n($ in thousands) Year Ended September 30,\n2023 Year Ended September 30,\nNet losses recognized during the period on equity securities $ 446 $ 1,228\nLess: net losses recognized during the period on equity securities sold during the period - -\nUnrealized losses recognized during the reporting period on equity securities still held at the reporting date $ 446 $ 1,228\nThere were no unrealized losses (gains) recognized during the year ended September 30, 2021.\nWe estimate the fair value of contingent consideration using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future earnings or other agreed upon metrics including the production of acquisition leads. The acquisition contingent consideration liability has been accounted for based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement (Level 3). The contingent consideration balance is recorded in Other payables and accrued expenses and Other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value and net present value of contingent consideration are recorded in Change in fair value of contingent consideration in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of contingent consideration is reassessed on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table sets forth the changes in fair value of our contingent consideration for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022:\n($ in thousands) Contingent Consideration\nBalance as of September 30, 2021 $ 12,072\nAdditions from acquisitions 15,321\nSettlement of contingent consideration (371)\nChange in fair value, including accretion 10,380\nBalance as of September 30, 2022 37,402\nAdditions from acquisitions 2,550\nSettlement of contingent consideration (17,167)\nChange in fair value, including accretion (1,604)\nBalance as of September 30, 2023 $ 21,181\nWe determined the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other payables and accrued expenses, floor plan notes payable, term note payable with Truist Bank, seller notes payable and company vehicle notes payable approximate their fair values because of the nature of their terms and current market rates of these instruments.\n15. Income Taxes\nThe Company is a corporation and, as a result is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes. OneWater LLC is treated as a pass-through entity for U.S. federal tax purposes and in most state and local jurisdictions. As such, OneWater LLCs members, including the Company, are liable for federal and state income taxes on their respective shares of OneWater LLCs taxable income.\nThe components of income tax (benefit) expense are:\n($ in thousands) Year Ended September 30,\n2023 Year Ended September 30,\n2022 Year Ended September 30,\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 16,184 $ 31,986 $ 18,966\nState 3,434 5,492 3,108\nForeign - 6 -\n19,618 37,484 22,074\nDeferred:\nFederal (19,171) 5,376 3,341\nState (3,859) 365 387\nForeign - - -\n(23,030) 5,741 3,728\nIncome tax (benefit) expense $ (3,412) $ 43,225 $ 25,802\nA reconciliation of the United States statutory income tax rate to the Companys effective income tax rate is as follows:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nStatutory federal tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 %\nIncome attributable to non-controlling interests and nontaxable income (0.2) (2.3) (5.5)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefit 3.3 2.9 2.4\nLoss on impairment (11.4) - -\nOther (4.7) 0.4 0.8\nEffective income tax rate 8.0 % 22.0 % 18.7 %\nDetails of the Companys deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n($ in thousands) September 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nDeferred tax assets:\nInvestment in partnerships $ 23,619 $ -\nTax receivable agreement 10,702 11,609\nNet operating loss 1,557 -\nOther - 3\nTotal 35,878 11,612\nValuation allowance - -\nTotal deferred tax assets 35,878 11,612\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nInvestment in partnerships $ - $ 2,410\nFixed assets 107 66\nIntangibles 703 703\nOther 2 -\nTotal deferred tax liabilities 812 3,179\nDeferred tax assets, net $ 35,066 $ 8,433\nThe Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards from underlying corporate entities of approximately $6 million resulting in a deferred tax asset of $1.6 million. The U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards have no expiration but can only be used to offset up to 80% of future taxable income annually.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets are more-likely-than-not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent results of operations. Based on our cumulative earnings history and forecasted future sources of taxable income, we believe that we will fully realize our deferred tax assets in the future. The Company has not recorded a valuation allowance.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company has not recognized any uncertain tax positions, penalties, or interest as management has concluded that no such positions exist. The Company is subject to examination in the US Federal and certain state tax jurisdictions for the tax years beginning with the year ended December 31, 2020. In November 2022, the Company received notification that the IRS intended to commence an audit of the federal income tax return of OneWater LLCs partnership for the tax year ended December 31, 2020. The audit is ongoing and the outcome and timing of settlements of asserted income tax liabilities, if any, are subject to significant uncertainty.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into a tax receivable agreement (the Tax Receivable Agreement) with certain of the owners of OneWater LLC. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, our liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement was $43.1 million and $46.4 million, respectively, representing 85% of the calculated net cash savings in U.S. federal, state and local income tax and franchise tax that OneWater Inc anticipates realizing in future years from the result of certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest as a result of OneWater Incs acquisition of OneWater LLC Units pursuant to an exercise of the Redemption Right or the Call Right (each as defined in the amended and restated limited liability company agreement of OneWater LLC (the OneWater LLC Agreement)).\nThe projection of future taxable income involves significant judgment. Actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could significantly impact our ability to make payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. We have determined it is more-likely-than-not that we will be able to utilize all of our deferred tax assets subject to the Tax Receivable Agreement; therefore, we have recorded a liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement related to the tax savings we may realize from certain increases in tax basis and certain tax benefits attributable to imputed interest as a result of OneWater Incs acquisition of OneWater LLC Units pursuant to an exercise of the Redemption Right or Call Right (each as defined in the OneWater LLC Agreement). If we determine the utilization of these deferred tax assets is not more-likely-than-not in the future, our estimate of amounts to be paid under the Tax Receivable Agreement would be reduced. In this scenario, the reduction of the liability under the Tax Receivable Agreement would result in a benefit to our consolidated statements of operations.\n16. Contingencies and Commitments\nEmployment Agreements\nThe Company is party to employment agreements with certain executives, which provide for compensation, other benefits and severance payments under certain circumstances. The Company also has consulting and noncompete agreements in place with previous owners of acquired companies.\nClaims and Litigation\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings as either the defendant or plaintiff. Due to their nature, such legal proceedings involve inherent uncertainties including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between the affected parties and other actions. Management assesses the probability of losses or gains for such contingencies and accrues a liability and/or discloses the relevant circumstances as appropriate. In the opinion of management, it is not reasonably probable that the pending litigation, disputes or claims against the Company, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, based on the Companys review of the various types of claims currently known, there is no indication of a material reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued. The Company currently does not anticipate that any known claim will materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. However, the outcome of any matter cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution of one or more matters presently known or arising in the future could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nRisk Management\nThe Company is exposed to various risks of loss related to torts; theft of, damage to, and destruction of assets; errors and omissions and natural disasters for which the Company carries commercial insurance. There have been no significant reductions in coverage from the prior year and settlements have not exceeded coverage in the past years.\n17. Leases\nThe Company leases real estate and equipment under operating lease agreements. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We recognize lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For leases with terms in excess of 12 months, we record a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. We do not have any significant leases that have not yet commenced that create significant rights and obligations for us. The Company has elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components for all leases that qualify.\nOur real estate and equipment leases often require payment of maintenance, real estate taxes and insurance. These costs are generally variable and based on actual costs incurred by the lessor. These amounts are not included in the consideration of the contract when determining the ROU asset and lease liability but are reflected as variable lease payments.\nMost leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease from one to ten or more years. The exercise of the lease renewal option is typically at our sole discretion. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option to renew, the period covered by the options are included in the lease term and are recognized as part of our ROU assets and lease liabilities. Certain leases include the option to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term, which includes renewal options reasonably certain to be exercised. As of September 30, 2023, our weighted-average lease term on operating leases was 9.9 years.\nCertain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on percentage of retail sales over contractual levels and others include rental payments adjusted periodically based on index rates. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nWhen available, the implicit rate is utilized to discount lease payments to present value; however, none of our leases provide a readily determinable implicit rate, therefore we use our incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the interest rate we would incur at lease commencement to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of the lease. As of September 30, 2023, our weighted average discount rate on operating leases was 5.1%.\nThe following table provides certain information related to lease costs for operating leases:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nOperating lease cost $ 21,332 $ 18,092 $ 12,059\nShort-term and variable lease cost 6,062 4,466 3,002\n$ 27,394 $ 22,558 $ 15,061\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information for leases:\nFor the Years Ended September 30,\n($ in thousands) 2023 2022 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases $ 20,704 $ 17,436 $ 11,905\nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities $ 27,128 $ 48,310 $ 25,555\nThe following table provides the maturities of our operating lease liabilities as of September 30, 2023:\n($ in thousands) Operating Leases\nYear ending September 30,\n2024 $ 20,898\n2025 20,255\n2026 18,547\n2027 17,015\n2028 17,481\nThereafter 84,388\nTotal minimum lease payments 178,584\nLess:\nPresent value adjustment (40,706)\nOperating lease liabilities $ 137,878\n18.

Segment Information\nEffective August 9, 2022, our reportable segments changed as a result of the Companys acquisition of Ocean Bio-Chem, which changed managements reporting structure and operating activities. We now report our operations through two reportable segments: (1) Dealerships and (2) Distribution.

Loans under the Inventory Financing Facility may be extended from time to time to enable the Company to purchase inventory from certain manufacturers with interest calculated using the Adjusted 30-Day Average SOFR plus an applicable margin. The other terms of the agreement remained largely unchanged. The Inventory Financing Facility expires on March 1, 2026. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date. No system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Companys management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that, as of September 30, 2023, the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nAttestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBoard of Directors and Stockholders\nOneWater Marine Inc.\nOpinion on internal control over financial reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of OneWater Marine Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended September 30, 2023, and our report dated December 14, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 14, 2023 Item 9B.
