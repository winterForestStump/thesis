    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nIntroduction\nWe are a consumer packaged goods holding company with businesses operating in the center-of-the-store, refrigerated, foodservice and food ingredient categories. We also participate in the private brand food category, including through our ownership interest in 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, Inc. (8th Avenue). Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in this Form 10-K to Post, the Company, us, our or we mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nPost is a Missouri corporation incorporated on September 22, 2011. On February 3, 2012, Post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin-off from its former parent company. On February 6, 2012, Post common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the ticker symbol POST.\nWe operate in four reportable segments:\nPost Consumer Brands: Includes branded and private label ready-to-eat (RTE) cereals from the businesses of Post Foods, LLC, MOM Brands Company, LLC, which Post acquired in May 2015, Weetabix North America, which Post acquired as part of its acquisition of Weetabix Limited in July 2017 referred to below, and certain private label RTE cereal operations, which Post acquired in June 2021, peanut butter under the Peter Pan brand, which Post acquired in January 2021, and branded and private label pet food, the brands and operations of which Post acquired in April 2023 (Pet Food);\nWeetabix: Includes the businesses of Weetabix Limited, which Post acquired in July 2017 and which produces and distributes branded and private label RTE cereal, hot cereals and other cereal-based food products, breakfast drinks and muesli primarily outside of North America, and Lacka Foods Limited, which Post acquired in April 2022 and which distributes and markets protein-based shakes under the UFIT brand primarily in the United Kingdom (the U.K.);\nFoodservice: Includes primarily egg and potato products in the foodservice and food ingredient channels from the businesses of MFI Holding Corporation (Michael Foods), which Post acquired in June 2014, National Pasteurized Eggs, Inc. (NPE), which Post acquired in October 2016, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (Bob Evans), which Post acquired in January 2018, Henningsen Foods, Inc., which Post acquired in July 2020, and Almark Foods (Almark), which Post acquired in February 2021; and\nRefrigerated Retail: Provides refrigerated retail products, inclusive of side dishes, eggs and egg products, sausage, cheese and other dairy and refrigerated products, from the businesses of Bob Evans, Michael Foods, including the business of Crystal Farms Dairy Company, which Post acquired as a part of its acquisition of Michael Foods in June 2014, NPE and Almark, as well as the Egg Beaters brand, which Post acquired in May 2021.\nIn October 2023, Post announced it had entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Perfection Pet Foods, LLC (Perfection), a manufacturer and packager of private label and co-manufactured pet food and baked treat products. Upon closing of the Perfection acquisition, the financial results of Perfection are expected to be reported in the Post Consumer Brands segment. Refer to Risk Factors in ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this report, the following risks and uncertainties, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although the risks below are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks to us, additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOperating and Market Risks\nMeasures taken to offset the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions to maintain our profitability, including increasing prices or decreasing product sizes, may be ineffective, inadequate or unavailable or may otherwise adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we take measures to mitigate the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions, including increased costs for ingredients, packaging, energy, other supplies and freight and employee-related costs, through pricing measures (such as increasing the selling prices of our products or decreasing the size of our products). However, the prices charged for our products may not reflect changes in our costs or the impact of other adverse events at the time they occur or at all. When these measures are ineffective or are not implemented in a timely manner, changes in costs and the impact of other adverse macroeconomic conditions may limit our ability to maintain existing margins and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows (some of which we experienced in fiscal 2023 and may experience in the future). Further, we may not be able to raise our prices sufficiently in response to cost increases or other adverse macroeconomic conditions (including if inflation or cost increases outpace our price elasticities or as a result of competitive pressures). In addition, such price increases could result in decreased sales volume or consumption or shifts to private label or other value brands, some of which we have experienced during fiscal 2023 and expect to experience during fiscal 2024. These impacts may be intensified by reductions in governmental assistance programs or incentives (as examples, the discontinuation of the heightened Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred during fiscal 2023, and the resumption of student loan repayments that were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in October 2023).\nDeterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates, volatility in capital markets, an economic recession or economic uncertainty, could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have in the past been and may continue to be adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates, decreased availability of capital, volatility in financial markets, declining consumer spending rates, recessions, decreased energy availability and increased energy costs (including fuel surcharges), supply chain challenges, labor shortages, geopolitical events or tensions, the negative impacts caused by government shutdowns, the negative impacts caused by public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nSuch adverse macroeconomic conditions and ongoing economic uncertainty have impacted us and could continue to impact us, or may impact us, in a variety of ways, including:\nconsumers shifting purchases from branded to lower-priced private label or other value products, shifting purchases from traditional retail outlets to mass merchandisers and dollar stores or forgoing certain purchases altogether during economic downturns, which could result in loss of our category share or sales volume or a shift in our product mix to lower margin offerings;\ncustomers managing their inventory levels in response to such adverse macroeconomic conditions;\ndecreased away-from-home demand, which during the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted our Foodservice business;\nincreased volatility in commodity and other input costs;\nincreased uncollectible receivables or non-performance due to the financial instability of our customers, suppliers, distributors or financial institutions;\nincreases in labor-related costs;\nincreases in the cost or difficulty of obtaining debt or equity financing to fund operations or investment opportunities, or to refinance our debt in the future, in each case on terms and within a time period acceptable to us; and\ndecreases to the fair value of our fixed rate debt and increases to interest expense on our variable rate debt.\nIncreased costs for raw materials, energy and other supplies, or limited availability of such inputs, could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe primary ingredients used by our businesses include wheat, oats, rice, corn, other grain products, eggs, pork and other animal proteins and fats, pasta, potatoes, bakery products, cheese, milk, butter, vegetable oils, dairy- and vegetable-based proteins, sugar and other sweeteners, fruit, nuts and water. Our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments also use corn and soybean meal as the primary grains fed to layer hens. Our primary packaging materials include folding cartons, corrugated boxes, flexible and rigid plastic film, trays and containers, beverage packaging, plastic lined cartonboard, large format bags and steel cans and lids. In addition, our manufacturing operations use large quantities of natural gas, electricity, diesel fuel, carbon dioxide, sanitizing supplies and personal protective equipment. Considerable amounts of diesel fuel also are used in connection with the distribution of our products, including in our internal fleets. The supply and price of these inputs are subject to market conditions and are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises, strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war), geopolitical events or tensions, national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire, water stress, animal feed costs, agricultural yield, governmental programs, incentives or controls, regulations or trade and tariff policies, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (such as the fiscal 2015, 2022 and 2023 avian influenza outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak) and milk price supports established by the USDA. From time to time, higher prices for natural gas, electricity and fuel also increase our ingredient, production and delivery costs. In addition, the prices of inputs may increase as we pursue more sustainable, specially sourced or certified raw materials or alternative energy sources, including mandatory or voluntary transitions to low carbon renewables, some of which we have experienced.\nWhile, historically, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, the prices of certain of our raw materials, energy and other supplies used in our businesses have fluctuated, unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, labor shortages and rising interest rates, have caused our raw materials and other input costs to increase. We expect these pressures to continue into fiscal 2024 for certain categories, but for our domestic operations, at a slower rate than we experienced in fiscal 2023. Similarly, from time to time, we experience diminished supply or shortages of certain of our inputs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us paying increased costs for such inputs or have impacted, and may in the future impact, our ability to produce our products. Although we try to manage the impact of increases in certain of these costs by using hedges to lock in prices on quantities required to meet our anticipated production requirements, if we fail, or are unable, to hedge and prices subsequently increase, or if we institute a hedge and prices subsequently decrease, our costs may be greater than anticipated or greater than our competitors costs, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nDisruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, third-party manufacturers and distributors, our ability to make, move, store and sell products is critical to our success. From time to time, damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing, warehousing or distribution capabilities resulting from inflation, the need for repairs or enhancements at facilities (including delays in repairing, obtaining and installing equipment), execution issues, labor shortages, insufficient product or raw material availability, operational or financial instability of parties in our supply chain, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other labor unrest, governmental restrictions or mandates, war or armed hostilities, geopolitical events or tensions, national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, border closures, any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire or evacuations related thereto, water stress, insects, plant diseases, diseases affecting livestock (such as the fiscal 2015, 2022 and 2023 avian influenza outbreaks and the 2013 PEDV swine outbreak), explosions, cybersecurity incidents, workforce disruptions (including as a result of widespread employee illness or widespread employee absenteeism) or other reasons impairs our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. Competitors are, from time to time, affected differently by any of these events depending on a number of factors, including the location of their operations, suppliers, third-party manufacturers and distributors. Failure to take adequate steps to reduce the likelihood or mitigate the potential impact of any of these events, or to effectively manage such events when they occur, particularly when an input is sourced from, or a product is manufactured at, a single location, could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nIn addition, construction of new or expansions of existing manufacturing facilities and other capital projects could result in manufacturing delays and increased costs (some of which we have experienced and may continue to experience). Further, any construction delays, including those resulting from equipment delays, could impact future demand for our products. If we are unable to complete capital projects within anticipated time frames and within our cost estimates, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we lose the services of key employees or are unable to recruit, hire, retain and develop a qualified and diverse workforce.\nOur employees are critical to our success. We depend upon the skills, working relationships and continued services of key employees, including members of our senior management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating goals depends upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain and develop a qualified and diverse workforce to operate and expand our businesses. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for skilled and talented people. During the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our businesses experienced heightened employee turnover and labor shortages, resulting in increased labor-related costs and our inability to meet consumer demand for certain of our products. Furthermore, as a result of such heightened employee turnover, certain of our businesses lost institutional knowledge. As a general matter, recruitment and retention of talent remains challenging in the current employment environment. In addition, a member of our senior management team or other key employee may find it necessary to take a leave of absence due to medical or other reasons. If we lose the services of key employees, including one or more members of our senior management team, and we fail to develop adequate succession plans, or if we fail to hire, retain and develop qualified and diverse talent to operate and expand our businesses, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be harmed. Activities relating to recruiting, hiring, integrating and training our workforce also may require significant time and expense.\nOur President and Chief Executive Officer is currently on medical leave, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer has been appointed to also serve as our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. The effectiveness of this transition, and any further transition, or the loss of services of any member of our senior management team, including our President and Chief Executive Officer or our Interim President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, could materially adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, result of operations or cash flows, significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our strategic objectives and operating goals and cause volatility in our stock price.\nWe are currently dependent upon third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many of our products. Our businesses could suffer as a result of a third partys inability to supply materials for our products or produce our products for us on time or to our specifications.\nOur businesses rely on independent third parties for the supply of materials for and the manufacture of many products. Our businesses could be materially affected if we fail to develop or maintain our relationships with these third parties, if any of these third parties is unable to fulfill its obligations to us, if any of these third parties fails to comply with governmental regulations applicable to the supply of materials for or the manufacturing of our products or if any of these third parties ceases doing business with us or goes out of business. Additionally, from time to time, we experience operational difficulties with these third parties, which may include increases in costs, reductions in the availability of materials or production capacity, delays in the addition of incremental capacity, failures to meet shipment or production deadlines, including as a result of public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and related governmental restrictions or mandates and any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire and water stress, cybersecurity incidents, errors in complying with specifications and insufficient quality control. The inability of a third-party supplier or manufacturer to ship orders in a timely manner or in desirable quantities or to meet our safety, quality and social compliance standards or regulatory requirements could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, certain of our relationships with third-party manufacturers and suppliers require us to purchase minimum volumes, and we could incur significant penalties if we do not purchase the minimum quantities required under these commitments.\nU.S. and global capital and credit market issues could negatively affect our liquidity, increase our costs of borrowing and disrupt the operations of our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, customers, distributors or financial institutions.\nU.S. and global credit markets have, from time to time, experienced significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions which have caused the spreads to applicable reference U.S. Treasury notes on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. In the past, such circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and in certain cases resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing, any of which could occur in the future. Further, our access to funds under our revolving credit facilities is dependent on the ability of the financial institutions that are parties to such facilities to meet their respective funding commitments. Unfavorable macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, supply chain challenges, labor shortages, high interest rates, lower consumer confidence, foreign currency exchange volatility, volatility in global capital markets, recession risks and macroeconomic uncertainty, have caused, and may in the future cause, periods of increased volatility and pricing in the credit and capital markets. If such periods of increased volatility recur, it may become more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock or other equity securities or debt financings, refinance our existing debt or sell our assets. These and other events affecting the credit and capital markets also have had, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on other financial markets in the U.S. Our businesses also could be negatively impacted if our suppliers, third-party manufacturers, customers or distributors experience disruptions resulting from tighter capital and credit markets or a slowdown in the general economy. Any of these risks could impair our\nability to fund our operations, limit our ability to expand our businesses, result in interruptions to our businesses or increase our interest expense, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by increases in freight costs or limited freight carrier availability.\nWe rely on trucking and railroad operators to deliver ingredients to manufacturing locations and to deliver our finished products to our customers. Freight costs are impacted by many factors beyond our control, including inflation, labor shortages, increased fuel costs, limited freight carrier availability, public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), strikes or other labor unrest, war or armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine), geopolitical events or tensions (such as between the U.S. and China), national or international disputes, terrorism or other acts of violence, increased demand, increased compliance costs associated with new or changing government regulations and any naturally occurring or climate change induced acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events. During fiscal 2022, we experienced increased freight costs, which leveled off during fiscal 2023, and we could experience increased freight costs in the future. In addition, shortages of freight operators may impact our ability to manufacture and deliver our products (some of which we have experienced).\nWe must identify changing consumer and customer preferences and behaviors and develop and offer products to meet these preferences and behaviors.\nConsumer and customer preferences and behaviors evolve over time due to a variety of factors. The success of our businesses depends on our ability to identify these changing preferences and behaviors, to distinguish between short-term trends and long-term changes in such preferences and behaviors and to continue to develop and offer products that appeal to consumers and customers through the sales channels that they prefer. Consumer preference and behavior changes include dietary trends, attention to different nutritional aspects of products, consumer at-home and on-the-go consumption patterns, shifts to private label or other value products, preferences for certain sales channels, concerns regarding the health effects of products, attention to sourcing practices relating to raw materials, animal welfare concerns, environmental concerns (including climate change) regarding packaging and manufacturing processes and attention to other social and governance aspects of our Company (including our products and operations) and of others in our supply chain. Any significant changes in consumer or customer preferences and behaviors and our inability to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, including during the COVID-19 pandemic, consumer shopping through eCommerce websites and mobile commerce applications has been prominent, and this trend is altering the retail landscape in which many of our products are sold and is intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. If we or our customers are unable to effectively compete in the eCommerce market or develop the data analytics capabilities needed to generate actionable commercial insights, and appropriately act on such insights, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Also, certain weight loss drugs, which may suppress a persons appetite, may impact demand for our products. In addition, our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses are, and will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the housing of layer hens, as well as certain other farm animals. Many restaurant chains, foodservice companies and grocery chains have announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply, as well as goals for other farm animal initiatives, by specified future dates. Also, several states have enacted, or may in the future enact, provisions providing for specific requirements for the housing of certain farm animals. Meeting anticipated customer demand has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating and capital costs to procure cage-free eggs, to modify existing layer facilities and to construct new cage-free layer housing and to comply with other farm animal initiatives. Also, our businesses are, and we expect will continue to be, affected by changing preferences and requirements as to the environmental and social impacts of products. Several of our customers have announced goals to transition to recyclable, compostable or reusable packaging or require certified ingredients for specific products. From time to time, these changing preferences and requirements require us to use specially sourced ingredients and packaging types that are more difficult to source or entail a higher cost or incremental capital investment, including within our manufacturing processes, which we may not be able to pass on to customers.\nOur sales and profit growth are dependent upon our ability to expand existing market penetration, enter into new markets and enhance our product portfolio with innovative and profitable products.\nSuccessful growth depends upon our ability to add new retail and foodservice customers, enter into new markets, expand the number of products sold through existing customers and enhance our product portfolio with new innovative and profitable products. The development and introduction of new products involves risks, such as the investment associated with developing and marketing such new products, uncertainties regarding trade and consumer acceptance of such new products, the timeliness of such new product introductions and the potential for such new products to cause a decline in sales of our existing products. In addition, our growth depends upon our ability to obtain new customers while also expanding our business with existing customers. Our failure to successfully add new customers, enter into new markets, expand our business with existing customers\nor enhance our product portfolio could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur reputation could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including adverse publicity about us, our business practices, products, packaging, ingredients or sponsorship or endorsement relationships (whether or not valid), our suppliers or third-party manufacturers business practices, our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, concerns about food safety, real or perceived health concerns regarding our products, lawsuits filed against us, our suppliers or our third-party manufacturers, our products becoming unavailable to consumers, consumer perceptions that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, any failure or perceived failure to achieve sufficient environmental, social and governance performance or any failure or perceived failure to act in a manner consistent with stakeholder expectations. In addition, negative perceptions of the food and beverage and pet food industries in their entirety, or segments of the food and beverage and pet food industries in which we operate, may heighten attention from consumers, third parties, the media, governments, our shareholders and other stakeholders and could adversely affect our reputation. The use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative social media posts or comments about us, our business practices, brands, products, ingredients, packaging, sponsorship or endorsement relationships, suppliers or third-party manufacturers or the food and beverage and pet food industries generally (whether or not valid) in the media could damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain favorable perceptions of our Company or brands or if we experience a loss of confidence in us or our products, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nAgricultural diseases or pests could harm our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our business activities are subject to a variety of agricultural risks, including agricultural diseases and pests, which can adversely affect the quality and quantity of the raw materials we use and the products we produce and distribute (or have produced or distributed by third parties), as well as increase the costs of production. Any actual or potential contamination of our products could result in product recalls, market withdrawals, product detentions, safety alerts, cessation of manufacturing or distribution or, if we fail to comply with applicable FDA, USDA or other U.S. or international regulatory authority requirements, enforcement actions. We also could be subject to product liability claims or adverse publicity if any of our products are alleged to have caused illness or injury.\nAvian influenza occasionally affects the domestic poultry industry, leading to hen deaths. In fiscal 2015, an avian influenza outbreak occurred in the Midwest of the U.S., affecting a substantial portion of our owned and third-party contracted flocks. In addition, in fiscal 2022 and early fiscal 2023, we were impacted by outbreaks of avian influenza. Although we utilize biosecurity measures at our layer locations to protect against disease exposures, if our facilities are exposed to diseases and pests, such exposure could affect a substantial portion of our production facilities in any year and could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, diseases affecting livestock (including PEDV) occasionally impact sow supply, which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTechnology failures or cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our businesses.\nInformation technology is critically important to our operations. We rely on information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store operating and financial information, to comply with regulatory, legal and tax requirements and to manage and support our business processes and activities, including our manufacturing operations. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers and third-party manufacturers and suppliers. With a number of employees working remotely in our workforce, our traditional network boundaries have been extended past our physical facilities, requiring that we protect our systems and data in environments that we do not control. In addition, third parties in our supply chain and other third-party providers, including our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and service providers (Third Parties), could be a source of security risk to us, or cause disruptions to our normal operations, in the event of a breach of their products, components, networks, security systems or infrastructure.\nIf we do not build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure or maintain or protect the related automated and manual control processes, or if one of our Third Parties fails to provide the products or services we require, we could be subject to, among other things, billing and collection errors, business disruptions or damage resulting from such events, particularly material security breaches and cybersecurity incidents. Our and our Third Parties information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of invasions, interruptions or malfunctions due to events beyond our or their control, including natural disasters, user error, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hardware and software failures, cybersecurity incidents, hackers and other causes. Such invasions, interruptions or malfunctions could negatively impact our businesses. If any of our or our Third Parties significant information technology systems suffers severe damage, disruption or shutdown, including by malicious or unintentional actions of contractors or employees or by cyber attacks,\nand our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. In addition, there is a risk of business interruption, competitive loss, litigation, violation of data privacy laws, reputational damage and other losses from such events, including any leaks of confidential or personal information resulting therefrom. While we have insurance programs in place related to these matters, the potential liabilities associated with such events, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, such insurance programs are costly, and the costs could increase substantially over time.\nCyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by individuals and groups (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored institutions, terrorist organizations and individuals or groups participating in organized crime) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, fraud, identity theft, public embarrassment with the intent to cause financial or reputational harm, corporate or nation-state espionage, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Our and our Third Parties networks and systems are subject to constant attempts to identify and exploit potential vulnerabilities in our and their operating environments potentially resulting in cyber intrusions, hacks or ransom attacks with intent to disrupt our and their business operations and capture, destroy, manipulate or expose various types of information relating to corporate trade secrets, customer information, vendor information and other sensitive business information, including acquisition activity, non-public financial results and intellectual property (General Cyber Events). Although we have not detected a material security breach to date, nor have we had a material impact resulting from a breach of one of our Third Parties, we have had and continue to experience General Cyber Events or other events of this nature and expect them to continue.\nWe implement and maintain systems and processes aimed at detecting and preventing information and cybersecurity incidents, which require significant investment, maintenance and ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies and regulatory requirements change and as efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Despite our efforts, the possibility of information and cybersecurity incidents and human error or malfeasance cannot be eliminated entirely and will evolve as new and emerging technology is deployed, including the use of generative artificial intelligence and personal mobile and computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments. Risks associated with such incidents and activities include theft of funds and other monetary loss, the disruption of our operations and the unauthorized disclosure, release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, modification, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary, trade secret or other information (including account data information), the effects of which could be compounded if not detected or reported quickly. An information or cybersecurity incident may not be detected until well after it occurs and the severity and potential impact may not be fully known for a substantial period of time after it has been discovered.\nLabor strikes or work stoppages by our employees could harm our businesses.\nSome of our full-time production, maintenance and warehouse employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A dispute with a union or employees represented by a union could result in production interruptions caused by strikes or work stoppages. If a strike or work stoppage were to occur, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, we periodically renegotiate the collective bargaining agreements in place at our facilities as such agreements expire, and we expect such agreements to be more difficult to negotiate due to, among other factors, heightened expectations from union members on wages, labor market conditions and inflation. As such agreements expire, if we are unable to enter into new agreements on favorable terms, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further, there is no guarantee that we will be able to enter into new agreements in a timely manner, and if new agreements are not reached, there could be interruptions in production at the respective facilities. In addition, we could be subject to unionization efforts at our non-union facilities. Increased unionization of our workforce could lead to disruptions in our businesses, increases in our operating costs and constraints on our operating flexibility.\nIn the event of a strike or work stoppage, we have contingency plans in place to hire additional labor or manufacture products in other locations to mitigate disruption to our businesses. However, there are limitations inherent in any plan to mitigate disruption to our businesses in the event of a strike or work stoppage, and particularly in the case of a prolonged strike or work stoppage, there can be no assurance that it would not have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur international operations subject us to additional risks.\nWe are subject to a number of risks related to doing business internationally, any of which could significantly harm our financial and operational performance. These risks include:\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, including potentially negative tax consequences;\nunfavorable changes in trade agreements or treaties, tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, import or export licensing requirements or other trade restrictions;\nunfavorable changes in local regulatory requirements that impact our ability to sell our products in that country;\nunfavorable currency exchange rates;\nchallenges associated with cross-border product distribution, including those that were caused (in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic) or may in the future be caused by a public health crisis;\nthe occurrence of a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which may cause us or our distributors, third-party manufacturers, vendors or customers to temporarily suspend our or their respective operations in the affected city or country;\nincreased exposure to general market and economic conditions, political and economic uncertainty and volatility and other events, including social unrest, government shutdowns, terrorist activity and other acts of violence, acts of war and other armed hostilities (such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine) and travel restrictions, outside of the U.S.;\ncompliance with U.S. laws and regulations affecting operations outside of the U.S., including anti-corruption regulations (such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act), and changes to such laws and regulations;\ncompliance with treaties, antitrust and competition laws, data privacy laws (including the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework), anti-corruption laws (including the U.K. Bribery Act), food safety and marketing laws and other regulatory requirements and a variety of other local, national and multi-national regulations and laws in multiple jurisdictions and changes to such treaties, laws and regulations;\nunfavorable changes in foreign tax treaties and policies, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or their interpretations or tax audit implications;\nexposure to evolving regulations and stakeholder expectations related to environmental, social and governance matters, which could have significant implications on our operations, products, marketing and disclosures;\nthe potential difficulty of enforcing intellectual property and contractual rights;\nincreased risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles;\nunfavorable changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing our operations; and\nthe difficulty and costs of designing and implementing an effective data security and control environment across diverse regions and employee bases.\nIn addition, the exit of the U.K. from the E.U. (Brexit) in 2020 created uncertainty surrounding certain of our businesses. While trading through Brexit has become normal course of business, we continue to plan for and mitigate risks to production post-Brexit. Specifically, as the E.U. and the U.K. amend legislation and regulations post-Brexit, there is a risk of increased divergence between the E.U. and the U.K. regulatory regimes, and we continue to monitor for divergence in regulations which could impact our supply chain operations. We also closely monitor and manage our inventory levels of imported raw materials and finished goods in the U.K. Despite our efforts to control costs, we have continued to see inflationary cost pressures rise in our U.K. business during fiscal 2023, as we also have experienced in other markets. If Brexit, or new trade arrangements between the U.K. and the E.U., negatively impact the U.K. economy or result in disagreements on trade terms, then the impact to our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.\nOur financial performance on a U.S. dollar denominated basis is subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we have operations and assets in foreign jurisdictions, as well as a portion of our contracts and revenues denominated in foreign currencies, and our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate our foreign assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses into U.S. dollars at applicable exchange rates. Consequently, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements. Our principal currency exposures are to the British pound sterling, the Euro and the Canadian dollar. From time to time, we enter into agreements that are intended to reduce the effects of our exposure to currency fluctuations, but these agreements may not be effective in significantly reducing our exposure. To the extent we fail to manage our foreign currency exposure adequately, we may suffer losses in value of our net investment in a foreign operation, and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.\nNational or international disputes, political instability, terrorism, war or armed hostilities may cause damage or disruption to us and our employees, facilities, suppliers, customers and information systems and could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeopolitical events, national or international disputes, political instability, terrorism or other acts of violence, war or armed hostilities, such as the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may cause damage or disruption to our operations,\ninternational commerce and the global economy. The reactions of governments, markets and the general public to such events, including economic sanctions, trade restrictions, tariffs and boycotts, may result in a number of adverse consequences for our businesses, suppliers and customers. Such events could lead to supply chain and transportation disruptions, constrained availability of raw materials and other commodities, inflation, increased commodity, energy and fuel costs, cyber attacks, breaches of information systems, foreign currency fluctuations and other disruptions that could adversely affect our businesses and our customers, distributors and suppliers. Such events also could result in physical harm to our or our customers, distributors or suppliers employees and property. In addition, such events could cause increased volatility in the capital markets, which could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any such events, including the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, such as those relating to capital markets, raw materials, energy and freight costs, our supply chain, information security and market conditions, any of which could negatively affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we do not have operations in Russia, Ukraine or Belarus and do not have significant direct exposure to customers in those countries, our businesses and operations have been negatively impacted by increased inflation, escalating energy and fuel prices and constrained availability, and thus increasing costs, of certain raw materials and other commodities, and declarations of force majeure by certain suppliers. These and other impacts have caused, and may continue to cause, an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows that may be material. Similarly, although we do not have operations, or significant direct exposure to customers, in Israel or Gaza, our businesses and operations could be negatively impacted by increased energy costs, supply chain disruptions or adverse impacts on customers.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our businesses, reputation and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and will continue to cause increases in the frequency or severity of any acute (including extreme weather and natural disasters) or chronic (including prolonged temperature and weather patterns) climatic events, fire and water stress. If any of these climatic events has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to disruptions in the availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials that are necessary for our products, including wheat, oats, corn and other grain products, sugar, fruit, nuts, eggs, potatoes, animal proteins and dairy products. In addition, increases in the frequency and severity of extreme weather or natural disasters may result in damage or disruptions to our manufacturing operations or our third-party manufacturers operations, disrupt our supply chain or distribution channels, impact demand for our products, increase our insurance or other operating costs or require us to make additional mandatory or voluntary capital expenditures. Also, water is essential to our businesses and the safety of our products, and the impacts of these climatic events may cause unpredictable availability of, or usage restrictions on, water of acceptable quality, which may lead to, among other things, adverse effects on our operations.\nThe increasing concern over climate change and related environmental sustainability matters also may result in more federal, state, local and foreign legal requirements, including requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or conserve and replenish water, implement new sustainability initiatives or comply with additional disclosure obligations. Collecting, measuring, analyzing and auditing information relating to such matters can be costly, time-consuming, dependent on third-party cooperation and unreliable. Our compliance, or our customers, suppliers or third-party manufacturers compliance, with existing laws and regulations and new laws or regulations enacted in the future, or any changes in how existing laws or regulations are enforced, administered or interpreted, may lead to an increase in compliance costs, cause changes in the way operations are conducted or expose us to additional risk of liabilities and claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, our customers or consumers may place increased priority on purchasing products that are sustainably grown and made and certified as such, requiring us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting and for the inputs for such products. Further, our businesses could be adversely affected if we are unable to remain effectively aligned with expectations from the media, shareholders and other stakeholders, which expectations may contradict one another, on strategy, performance and disclosure on climate change and other environmental, social and governance matters, which could result in reduced demand for our products or adverse impacts on our ability to raise capital or could divert the attention of management and our employees from operating our businesses. Any failure to meet or delay in meeting, or perceived failure to meet or delay in meeting, stakeholder expectations on environmental, social and governance matters or any perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to environmental, social or governance matters could lead to adverse publicity, which could damage our reputation, which in turn could adversely impact our financial results or our ability to raise capital, as well as expose us to regulatory and legal risks.\nPublic health crises may adversely impact our financial and operational performance.\nPublic health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to such crises may have significant impacts on our businesses. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced, among other impacts, shifts away from consumption of our foodservice and certain on-the-go products due to reduced consumer traffic or changes in consumer preferences, adverse impacts on our operations and the operations of third parties in our supply chain resulting in disruptions in our ability to manufacture and deliver our products, adverse impacts on our operating costs, unexpected variability and volatility in consumer demand and delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives. The COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in broader economic and operational challenges, including heightened inflation, labor shortages, volatility in commodity and operating costs and supply chain disruptions, and some of such adverse economic conditions continue to impact us. Public health crises evolve rapidly, and the severity, magnitude and duration of such public health crises are uncertain and difficult to predict. Future public health crises may result in similar impacts or additional challenges that we may not be able to foresee. Any public health crisis also may heighten or manifest other risks set forth herein. Any of these impacts may be material to our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndustry Risks\nWe operate in categories with strong competition.\nThe human and pet food categories in which we operate are highly competitive. Competition in our categories is based on, among other things, brand appeal, recognition and loyalty, taste, nutritional value, price, ingredients, product quality, product availability, variety, innovation, distribution, shelf space and product visibility, packaging, convenience, effective promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. The ability of our retail businesses to compete may be limited by an inability to secure new retailers or maintain or add shelf or retail space for our products. Retailers may not provide us sufficient, if any, shelf space, and online retailers may not provide access to, or adequate product visibility on, their platforms. Certain weight loss drugs, which may suppress a persons appetite, may cause competition in our product categories to increase, if consumers reduce purchases of certain types of foods or of food products altogether. Some of our competitors may have substantial financial, marketing and other resources and may spend more aggressively on advertising and promotional activities than we do. In addition, smaller competitors have been gaining market share in categories in which our retail businesses compete. In most of our categories, we compete not only with widely advertised branded products, but also with private label and store brand products. Increased competition can reduce our sales due to loss of market share or the need to reduce prices to respond to competitive and customer pressures or can result in increased capital, marketing or other expenditures. Competitive and customer pressures, as well as industry supply and market demand, also may limit our ability to increase prices, including in response to increased costs (such as those resulting from inflation). Also, our competitors continue to expand and evolve their usage of social media networks and digital platforms to advertise products. If we are unable to compete in this environment and use social media and digital platforms effectively, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments operate in the mature RTE cereal category, and the weakening of this category could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments produce and distribute branded, licensed and private label RTE cereals and hot cereals, other cereal-based food products and muesli, selling products to grocery stores, discounters, retailers, foodservice distributors, wholesalers and convenience stores primarily across the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, the U.K. and Ireland. Despite the strong demand experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic starting in March 2020 and continuing through the first half of fiscal 2021, the RTE cereal category had previously been experiencing weakness in recent years, and the RTE cereal category has since returned to demand levels largely in line with pre-pandemic levels. Continuing weakness in the RTE cereal category, or the weakening of our major products competing in this category, could have a material adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of, a significant reduction of purchases by or the bankruptcy of a major customer may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, consolidation of our customer base, as well as competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may hurt our volumes or profit margins.\nA limited number of customers represents a large percentage of our consolidated net sales. Our largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 17.3% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. Walmart also is the largest customer of our Post Consumer Brands segment, accounting for 32.6% of Post Consumer Brandss net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Weetabix segment, Tesco and Asda, accounted for 28.3% of Weetabixs net sales in fiscal 2023. The largest customers of our Foodservice segment, Sysco and US Foods, accounted for 40.5% of the segments net sales in fiscal 2023. Additionally, the largest customers of our Refrigerated Retail segment, Walmart and Kroger, accounted for 32.9% of the segments net sales in fiscal 2023. For purposes of this risk factor, Walmart refers to Walmart Inc. and its affiliates, which include Sams Club.\nThe success of our businesses depends, in part, on our ability to maintain our level of sales and product distribution through high-volume food distributors, retailers, club stores, supercenters, mass merchandisers, pet supply retailers and national restaurant chains. The competition to supply products to these high-volume customers is intense. Our customers generally are not contractually obligated to purchase from us, and they frequently reevaluate the products they carry. A decision by any of our major customers to decrease the amount of product purchased from us, including in response to shifts in consumer purchasing or traffic trends, sell another brand on an exclusive or priority basis, reduce shelf space allotted to our products, demand reduced pricing or change the manner of doing business with us could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our retail customers also may offer branded and private label products that compete directly with our products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases. Accordingly, there is a risk that our customers may give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors. In the event of a loss of any of our large customers, a significant reduction of purchases by any of our large customers or the bankruptcy or serious financial difficulty of any of our large customers, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nOver the past several years, the retail and foodservice channels have undergone significant consolidations, and mass merchandisers and non-traditional retailers, including online food retailers and discount retailers, have been gaining market share. As this trend continues and such customers grow larger, they from time to time seek to use their position to improve their profitability through improved efficiency, lower pricing, increased reliance on their own brand name products, increased emphasis on private label and other value brands and increased promotional programs. In addition, larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories. If we are unable to respond to this environment, our profitability or volume growth could be negatively impacted. Additionally, if any of our existing retailer or distributor customers are consolidated with another entity and the surviving entity of any such consolidation is not a customer or decides to discontinue purchasing our products, we may lose significant amounts of our preexisting business with the acquired retailer or distributor. These consolidations also may adversely impact the ability of our smaller customers to effectively compete. The consolidation in the retail and foodservice channels also increases the risk that adverse changes to our customers business operations or financial performance could have a material adverse effect on us. Further, the traditional retail grocery outlets in the U.S. where certain of our businesses are concentrated have experienced slower growth in recent years than other retail channels, such as discount and dollar stores, direct-to-consumer brands, subscription services, club stores and eCommerce retailers. This trend accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect it to continue in the future. Our businesses may be adversely affected if such non-traditional retailers take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers, if we are unable to effectively participate in such non-traditional retail channels, if our customers fail to find ways to create digital tools and capabilities to enable them to grow their businesses or if consumer price deflation occurs as a result of this trend.\nOur private label products may not be able to compete successfully with nationally branded products.\nWe participate in the private brand food category, producing and distributing private label products, including through our ownership interest in 8th Avenue. In many cases, competitors with nationally branded products have a competitive advantage over private label products due to name recognition. In addition, when branded competitors focus on price and promotion, the environment for private label producers and distributors becomes more challenging because the price differential between private label products and branded products may become less significant. Competitive pressures or promotions of branded products could cause us, 8th Avenue or our or 8th Avenues customers to lose sales, which may require us or 8th Avenue to lower prices or increase the use of discounting or promotional programs, each of which could adversely affect our or 8th Avenues margins, businesses, financial condition, results of operations, profitability and cash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the Pet Food operations and realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, or the parties may be unable to fulfill their obligations under agreements related to the acquisition.\nThe Pet Food acquisition involves the combination with us of a business that has operated independently of us and represents our entry into the pet food industry and category. We are devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating business practices, cultures and operations of our pre-acquisition businesses and the Pet Food operations and to offering a new platform of pet food products. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\nthe inability to successfully combine our pre-acquisition businesses with the Pet Food operations in a manner that permits us to achieve the synergies and other benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition;\nthe challenges of providing a new offering of pet food products for which we have limited experience and of integrating complex information technology systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets acquired as part of the Pet Food acquisition in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\npotential unknown liabilities, liabilities that are significantly larger than we currently anticipate and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the Pet Food acquisition, including cash costs for integration that may exceed the cash costs that we currently anticipate;\nour inability to comply with our obligations to manufacture certain products for The J. M. Smucker Company (Smucker) under a co-manufacturing agreement;\nour dependence on Smucker to continue to manufacture certain products and to provide certain services and information, including financial information, to us for a period of time pursuant to transition services agreements and a co-manufacturing agreement; and\nour limited post-closing indemnification or similar rights under the purchase agreement we entered into with Smucker concerning the representations and warranties Smucker made in the purchase agreement with respect to the Pet Food acquisition. No portion of the purchase price for the acquisition was held in escrow for the purpose of funding indemnifications claims, so we will have limited recourse against Smucker in the event any of the representations or warranties made by Smucker in the purchase agreement prove to be inaccurate or are breached.\nAccordingly, the contemplated benefits of the Pet Food acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur announced acquisition of Perfection is subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions and may not be consummated, which could adversely impact our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the price of our common stock.\nOn October 10, 2023, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire Perfection. Completion of this acquisition is subject to certain customary closing conditions.\nWe expect the Perfection acquisition to be completed late in the fourth calendar quarter of 2023, our first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2024. However, there can be no assurance that all closing conditions for the acquisition will be satisfied and, if they are satisfied, that they will be satisfied in time for the closing to occur during the previously referenced time frame.\nIf the Perfection acquisition is not completed, our ongoing business and financial results may be adversely affected, and we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\nwe have dedicated significant time and resources, financial and otherwise, in planning for the acquisition and the associated integration;\nwe are responsible for certain transaction costs relating to the Perfection acquisition, whether or not the acquisition is completed;\nwe are currently dependent on Smucker to continue to manufacture certain products for a limited period of time under a co-manufacturing agreement, and without the assets and facilities we anticipate acquiring from Perfection, we will be unable to manufacture such products on our own after the expiration of the co-manufacturing agreement;\nwe may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our customers and employees;\nmatters relating to the acquisition (including integration planning) may require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, whether or not the acquisition is completed, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; and\nwe may be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the acquisition or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the purchase agreement.\nIf the Perfection acquisition is not completed, these risks may materialize and may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as the price of our common stock.\nOur business strategy depends upon us identifying and completing additional acquisitions and other strategic transactions. We may not be able to successfully consummate favorable strategic transactions in the future. Our corporate development activities also may have an adverse impact on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we continuously evaluate strategic transactions, we may be unable to identify suitable strategic transactions in the future or may not be able to enter into such transactions at favorable prices or on terms that are favorable to us. Alternatively, we may in the future enter into additional strategic transactions, and any such transaction could happen at any time, could be material to our businesses and could take any number of forms, including, for example, an acquisition, investment or merger, for cash or in exchange for our equity securities, a divestiture or a joint venture.\nEvaluating potential transactions, including divestitures and joint ventures, requires additional expenditures (including legal, accounting and due diligence expenses, higher administrative costs to support any acquired entities and information technology,\npersonnel and other integration expenses) and may divert the attention of our management from ordinary course operating matters.\nOur corporate development activities also may present financial and operational risks and may have adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In addition, future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets and increased operating expenses, all of which could, individually or collectively, adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating acquired businesses, or acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nWe have acquired multiple businesses, and we may continue to acquire other businesses, including Perfection. The successful integration of these acquisitions depends upon our ability to manage the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses. Integrating operations is complex and requires significant efforts and expenses on the part of both us and the acquired businesses. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include, but are not limited to, the following:\nemployees may voluntarily or involuntarily separate employment from us or the acquired businesses because of the acquisitions;\nour management may have its attention diverted while trying to integrate the acquired businesses;\nwe may encounter obstacles when incorporating the acquired businesses into our operations and management, including integrating or separating personnel, financial systems, operating procedures, regulatory compliance programs, technology, networks and other assets in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\nwe may encounter differences in business backgrounds, corporate cultures and management philosophies;\nintegration may be more costly, time-consuming or complex or less effective than anticipated;\nwe may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls and procedures; and\nwe may discover previously undetected operational or other issues, such as fraud.\nAny of these factors could adversely affect our and the acquired businesses ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies.\nIn addition, the success of these acquired businesses will depend, in part, upon our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost synergies through the successful integration of the businesses we acquire with our pre-existing businesses. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired businesses, these integrations may not result in the realization of the full benefit of any anticipated growth opportunities or cost synergies or these benefits may not be realized within the expected time frames. In addition, acquired businesses may have unanticipated liabilities or contingencies.\nIf the transactions we undertook relating to divestitures of our interest in BellRing do not qualify for their intended tax treatment, we may incur significant tax liabilities.\nIn March 2022, we completed a series of transactions related to a divestiture of a substantial portion of our interest in BellRing, which included the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange. After the BellRing Distribution, we retained 14.2% of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. During August 2022, we completed the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange. Immediately after the completion of the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange, we held 3.4% of the shares of BellRing Common Stock. During November 2022, we completed the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange, which resulted in us no longer holding any interest in BellRing. Detailed descriptions of the transactions discussed in this risk factor are provided in Business in Item 1 of this report under the heading Recent Strategic Transactions - BellRing Brands, Inc.\nThe BellRing Distribution was conditioned upon the receipt of a tax opinion from our tax advisor which concluded that the BellRing Distribution, together with certain related transactions, such as the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange and the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange, qualifies as a tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the IRC) and is eligible for nonrecognition within the meaning of Sections 355 and 361 of the IRC. The tax opinion was based on, among other things, then-current law and certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters and certain statements and undertakings made by us and Old BellRing. Any change in the then-current applicable law, which may or may not be retroactive, or the failure of any factual representation, assumption, statement or undertaking to be true, correct and complete in all material respects, could adversely affect the conclusions reached in the tax opinion. In addition, the tax opinion is not binding on the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS) or the courts, and the IRS and/or the courts may not agree with the tax opinion. If the BellRing Distribution, the Debt-for-Debt Exchange, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange do not qualify as tax-free transactions for any reason, we may\nrecognize a substantial gain for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows.\nMoreover, if the BellRing Distribution is determined not to qualify for nonrecognition of gain and loss under Sections 368(a) and 355 of the IRC, each of our U.S. shareholders who received shares of BellRing Common Stock in the BellRing Distribution would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares of BellRing Common Stock received by such shareholder in the BellRing Distribution. In the event that one of our shareholders is treated as receiving a taxable distribution pursuant to the BellRing Distribution, the distribution to such shareholder would generally be taxable as a dividend to the extent of such shareholders allocable share of our current and accumulated earnings and profits (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes). To the extent the distribution exceeds such earnings and profits, the distribution would generally constitute a non-taxable return of capital to the extent of such shareholders tax basis in its shares of Post common stock, with any remaining amount of the distribution taxed as a capital gain.\nPursuant to a tax matters agreement among us, BellRing and Old BellRing (the Tax Matters Agreement), BellRing has agreed to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from certain events, actions or inactions that BellRing takes that could affect the intended tax-free treatment of the transactions as set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, including causing any portion of the BellRing Distribution, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange to be taxable to us. BellRings indemnification obligations to us are not limited by any maximum amount and such amounts could be substantial. If BellRing were required to indemnify us under the circumstances set forth in the Tax Matters Agreement, BellRing may be subject to substantial liabilities and there is no assurance that BellRing will be able to satisfy such indemnification obligations.\nFurthermore, pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, if and to the extent (i) the BellRing Distribution, the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange and/or the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange do not qualify as tax-free transactions, (ii) such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions gives rise to adjustments to the tax basis of assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries and (iii) BellRing is not required to indemnify us for any tax liabilities resulting from such failure to qualify as tax-free transactions pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we will be entitled to periodic payments from BellRing equal to 85% of the tax savings arising from the aggregate increase to the tax basis of the assets held by BellRing and its subsidiaries resulting from such failure. Any failure by BellRing to satisfy these periodic payments, which could be substantial, could materially adversely affect our businesses, financial condition and cash flows.\nOur Company has overlapping directors and management with BellRing and 8th Avenue, each of which may lead to conflicting interests or the appearance of conflicting interests.\nSeveral of our directors and officers also serve as directors or officers of BellRing and 8th Avenue, and there are overlapping directors with such entities. Our officers and members of our Board of Directors have fiduciary duties to our shareholders. Likewise, any such persons who serve in similar capacities at any of such other companies have fiduciary duties to that companys shareholders. Therefore, such persons may have conflicts of interest or the appearance of conflicts of interest with respect to matters involving or affecting us and one or more other companies to which they owe fiduciary duties. In addition, some of our officers or members of our Board of Directors may own equity or options to purchase equity in one or more of such other companies. Such ownership interests may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when the applicable individuals are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and the other companies. The appearance of conflicts of interest created by such overlapping relationships also could impair the confidence of our investors.\nFinancial Risks\nWe have substantial debt and high leverage, which could have a negative impact on our financing options and liquidity position and could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. We had $6,049.6 million in aggregate principal amount of total debt as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, our secured revolving credit facility had borrowing capacity of $730.3 million at September 30, 2023 (all of which would be secured when drawn).\nOur overall leverage and the terms of our financing arrangements could:\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, for capital expenditures, for acquisitions, to fund growth or for general corporate purposes, even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity, particularly if any ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under the terms of our financing arrangements;\ntrigger limitations on our ability to deduct interest paid on such indebtedness;\nlimit our ability to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us or at all;\nnegatively impact our credit ratings;\nlimit our flexibility to plan for and to adjust to changing business and market conditions in the industries in which we operate and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to make interest and principal payments on our debt, thereby limiting the availability of our cash flows to fund future investments, capital expenditures, working capital, business activities and other general corporate requirements;\nrequire us to use cash, shares of our common stock or both to settle any conversion obligations of our 2.50% convertible senior notes maturing in 2027 (the Convertible Notes), and require us to use cash to repurchase some or all of the Convertible Notes if a fundamental change (for example, a change of control of the Company) occurs;\nincrease our vulnerability to adverse macroeconomic or industry conditions; and\nsubject us to higher levels of indebtedness than our competitors, which may cause a competitive disadvantage and may reduce our flexibility in responding to increased competition.\nOur ability to meet expenses and debt service obligations will depend upon our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, including the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions), public health crises, potential changes in consumer and customer preferences and behaviors, the success of product and marketing innovation and pressure from competitors. If we do not generate enough cash to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt at less favorable rates, sell assets, borrow more money or issue additional equity.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may be able to incur substantially more debt, which could further exacerbate the risks related to our debt and leverage.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the financing arrangements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also may not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, as defined in the documents governing our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our debt, including the indentures governing our senior notes, contain, or may in future financings contain, various covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions and also require us to meet financial maintenance tests, and failure to comply with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur financing arrangements contain restrictions, covenants and events of default that, among other things, require us to satisfy certain financial tests and maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to refinance our existing indebtedness and to pay dividends. Financing arrangements which we enter into in the future could contain similar restrictions and could additionally require us to comply with similar, new or additional financial tests or to maintain similar, new or additional financial ratios. The terms of our financing arrangements, financing arrangements which we enter into in the future and any future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to pay dividends, respond to market conditions, provide for capital investment needs or take advantage of business opportunities by limiting the amount of additional borrowings we may incur. These restrictions include compliance with, or maintenance of, certain financial tests and ratios and may limit or prohibit our ability to, among other things:\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\ncreate liens;\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock or other securities;\nmake investments and acquisitions;\nenter into or permit to exist contractual limits on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends to us;\nenter into new lines of business;\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control, including the impact of adverse macroeconomic conditions (including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions) and public health crises, could affect our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants. Failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants in our existing or future financing arrangements could result in a default under those arrangements and under other arrangements containing cross-default provisions.\nOur credit agreement contains customary financial covenants, including a covenant requiring us to maintain a secured net leverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) not to exceed 4.25 to 1.00, measured as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, if, as of the last day of such fiscal quarter, the aggregate outstanding amount of all revolving credit loans, swing line loans and letter of credit obligations (subject to certain exceptions specified in our credit agreement) exceeds 30% of our revolving credit commitments. In addition to the foregoing, under the terms of Joinder Agreement No. 4 dated April 26, 2023 (the Joinder Agreement), which provided for an incremental term loan of $400.0 million (the Fourth Incremental Term Loan) under our credit agreement, so long as any principal or accrued interest remains outstanding with respect the Fourth Incremental Term Loan, we are required to comply with financial covenants consisting of the foregoing secured net leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in our credit agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00, with each such financial covenant measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. In addition, the Joinder Agreement contain certain mandatory prepayment provisions.\nA default would permit the lenders or noteholders, as applicable, to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these arrangements and, with respect to our credit agreement, to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations, including our obligations under our indentures and credit agreement. In addition, the limitations imposed by financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nCertain of our subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants in our debt, and their financial resources and assets may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness.\nWe have designated 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under our credit agreement and senior note indentures. Any subsidiary that is designated as unrestricted is not a guarantor under our credit agreement or under our senior note indentures, and the assets of our unrestricted subsidiaries do not secure our obligations under our credit agreement. In addition, 8th Avenue has entered into secured credit facilities that are separate from our credit agreement and senior note indentures and that restrict, among other matters, its ability to make distributions to us or engage in transactions with us. Accordingly, the financial resources and other assets of 8th Avenue and its subsidiaries may not be available to us to pay our obligations on our indebtedness or, if available, may be significantly limited.\nTo service our indebtedness and other cash needs, we will require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash depends upon many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to pay interest on our outstanding senior notes, to fund the settlement of our Convertible Notes, to satisfy our other debt obligations and to fund any planned capital expenditures, dividends and other cash needs will depend in part upon the future financial and operating performance of our subsidiaries and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the impact of periods of inflation, rising interest rates, recessions and public health crises, will affect our ability to make these payments.\nIf we are unable to make payments or refinance our debt or obtain new financing under these circumstances, we may consider other options, including:\nsales of assets;\nsales of equity;\nreductions or delays of capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments; or\nnegotiations with our lenders to restructure the applicable debt.\nOur businesses may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available to us in a sufficient amount, to enable us to pay our indebtedness, including the senior notes and our other debt obligations, or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nUnsuccessful implementation of business strategies to reduce costs, or unintended consequences of the implementation of such strategies, may adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of our costs, such as raw materials, energy and freight, are impacted by factors that are outside of our control. Therefore, to offset any increases in such costs, we must seek to reduce costs in other areas, such as through operating efficiency. If we are not able to complete projects designed to reduce costs and increase operating efficiency on time or within budget, or if the implementation of these projects results in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees or reduced productivity, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted. Labor shortages, inflation and shortages of materials have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our ability to timely obtain equipment and materials necessary to complete planned capital projects. Future disruptions and\nuncertainties for a sustained period of time could result in additional delays or modifications to our strategic plans and other initiatives or impact our ability to complete projects to reduce costs or improve efficiency on planned timelines. If the cost-saving initiatives we have implemented, or any future cost-saving initiatives, do not generate the expected cost savings and synergies, our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nActual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance and forward-looking statements.\nFrom time to time, we release guidance regarding our future performance, the future performance of some or all of our unconsolidated and consolidated subsidiaries or the expected future performance of companies or businesses that we have agreed to acquire. This guidance, which consists of forward-looking statements, is prepared by our management and is qualified by, and subject to, the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in such release and certain factors described in our current and periodic reports filed with the SEC. Our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party has audited, reviewed, examined, compiled or applied agreed upon procedures with respect to the guidance, and accordingly, no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto. The independent registered public accounting firm report included herein relates to our historical financial statements. It does not extend to any guidance and should not be read to do so.\nGuidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that, although presented with numerical specificity, are inherently subject to business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions, some of which will change. We generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges. The principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors. We do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons.\nGuidance is necessarily speculative in nature, and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results. Accordingly, our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release. Actual results will vary from the guidance. Investors also should recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecasted. In light of the foregoing, investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it.\nAny failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the risks or uncertainties set forth in this report could result in actual operating results being different than the guidance, and such differences may be adverse and material.\nImpairment in the carrying value of intangible assets could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. If our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, we will be required to record impairment charges, which may be significant.\nOur balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets, including goodwill, trademarks, trade names, customer relationships and other acquired intangibles. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are expected to contribute indefinitely to our cash flows and are not amortized. Management reviews all intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. Impairments to intangible assets may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as increasing competitive pricing pressures, lower than expected revenue and profit growth rates, changes in industry EBITDA (which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and revenue multiples, changes in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital (interest rates, etc.) or the bankruptcy of a significant customer. These factors, along with other internal and external factors, could have a significant negative impact on our fair value determination, which could then result in a material impairment charge in our results of operations. In fiscal 2023, we had an impairment of goodwill and no impairments of other intangible assets. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, we had no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets. Refer to Notes 2 and 8 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nIncreases in labor-related costs, including the costs of medical and other employee health and welfare benefits, may reduce our profitability.\nInflationary pressures, shortages in the labor market and increased competition for skilled and talented employees have increased our labor costs, which have negatively impacted our profitability, and we expect this trend to continue into fiscal 2024, although there are some economic indicators beginning to signal an alleviation of wage pressures. Although we continue to develop and enhance opportunities for efficient work processes, including using robotic technology and other artificial intelligence capabilities, an inability to automate processes in our manufacturing and distribution facilities could cause this trend of increasing labor costs to continue. Labor costs also include the costs of providing medical and other health and welfare benefits to our employees as well as certain former employees. With 11,430 employees as of November 1, 2023 (which excludes\nthe employees of our unconsolidated subsidiaries), our profitability may be substantially affected by the costs of such benefits. Although we try to control these costs, they can vary because of changes in health care laws and claims experience, which have the potential to increase the cost of providing medical and other employee health and welfare benefits. Any substantial increase in these costs could have a materially negative impact on our profitability.\nIncreases in interest rates may negatively affect earnings.\nAs of September 30, 2023, we did not have debt outstanding under our variable interest rate revolving credit facility, and we had $400.0 million of variable interest rate term loan debt and $5.3 million of municipal bond debt outstanding. We utilize derivative instruments to hedge the variable interest rate risk associated with our outstanding term loan debt. In the future, we may have additional debt outstanding with exposure to interest rate risk. As a result, we may be adversely impacted by rising interest rates. Also, at September 30, 2023, we held derivative instruments, including those hedging our variable interest rate term loan debt previously referenced, whose market values are subject to changes in the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) rate. These derivative instruments have resulted, and may continue to result, in volatility in our financial results due to interest rate fluctuations.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority fully discontinued the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate as of June 30, 2023. With the transition from LIBOR to SOFR as the preferred alternative to LIBOR, we have transitioned and amended our contracts to reference the SOFR rate where required. Although we have not experienced, and do not expect to experience, a material adverse impact from the transition from LIBOR to SOFR, the consequences of the transition remain uncertain at this time.\nVolatility in the market value of derivative instruments we use to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates may cause volatility in our net earnings.\nWe utilize derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk for some of our principal ingredients and energy costs. In addition, from time to time, we utilize derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk. Changes in the fair value of these derivative instruments, which are not designated for hedge accounting, are recognized immediately in our Consolidated Statements of Operations, resulting in volatility in our net earnings. If the fair value of these derivative instruments changes in an unpredictable or significantly favorable or unfavorable manner, we may experience material adjustments within our results of operations. Refer to Notes 2 and 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report for a discussion of our derivative instruments.\nGains and losses related to our commodity derivative instruments are reported in cost of goods sold in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and in unallocated general corporate expenses in our segment operating results until we utilize the underlying input in our manufacturing process, at which time the gains and losses are recorded within segment operating profit. Gains and losses related to our interest rate derivative instruments are reported in income/expense on swaps, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOur borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets could be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings.\nRating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our debt are based upon a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all and result in a reduction in our liquidity. Our borrowing costs and access to capital markets also could be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may experience losses or be subject to increased funding and expenses to our qualified pension and other postretirement plans, which could negatively impact profits.\nWe maintain and contribute to qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., primarily for our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix businesses. With respect to those plans we maintain, we are obligated to ensure that such plans are funded or paid in accordance with applicable regulations. In the event the assets in which we invest do not perform according to expectations, or the valuation of the projected benefit obligation increases due to changes in interest rates or other factors, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to these plans and recognize increased expense on our financial statements.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nIf our products become adulterated or contaminated, or if they are misbranded or mislabeled, we might need to recall or withdraw those items and may experience product liability claims if consumers or their pets are injured.\nSelling products for human and animal consumption involves a number of risks, including contamination, spoilage, degradation, tampering, allergens, mislabeling or other adulteration. Additionally, many of the ingredients used to make certain of our products, including eggs, pork, nuts, raw potatoes and grains, are vulnerable to contamination by naturally occurring molds and pathogens, such as salmonella. These pathogens may survive in our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution or delivered. We may need to recall, withdraw or isolate some or all of our products if there is suspected or confirmed damage, adulteration, undeclared allergens, mislabeling, misbranding or other food safety concerns, whether caused by us or someone in our supply chain or distribution network. Such an incident could result in destruction of product ingredients and inventory, negative publicity, temporary plant closings, supply chain interruption, substantial costs of compliance or remediation, fines and increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. New scientific discoveries regarding ingredients, microbes and food manufacturing may bring additional risks and latent liability. Should consumption of any of our products cause illness or injury, we may be liable for monetary damages as a result of claims against us. In addition, adverse publicity, including claims, whether or not valid, that our products or ingredients are unsafe or of poor quality, may discourage consumers or customers from buying our products or cause production and delivery disruptions. Although we have various insurance programs in place, any of these events or a loss of consumer or customer confidence could have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nViolations of laws or regulations, as well as new laws or regulations or changes to existing laws or regulations or to interpretations thereof, could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to a variety of laws and extensive regulations administered by federal, state and local government authorities for both the countries where we manufacture or license products, primarily in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and those where we distribute products, including requirements related to food safety, quality, manufacturing, processing, storage, marketing, advertising, labeling and distribution, animal welfare, worker health and workplace safety. Changes in these legal or regulatory requirements, including new food safety requirements, revised labeling requirements for human or pet food (such as front of pack labeling requirements, changes to nutrition facts labeling and pet food label modernization), and sales or media and marketing restrictions, or evolving interpretations of existing legal or regulatory requirements, may result in increased compliance costs and other financial obligations. In the U.S., we are regulated by, and our activities are affected by, among other federal, state and local authorities and regulations, the FDA, the USDA, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Californias Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65). Internationally, we are regulated by, among other authorities, Health Canada, the U.K.s Food Standards Agency, Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Environmental Health, the Information Commissioners Office and the Trading Standards Office and their equivalents in E.U. member states. We also are regulated by similar authorities elsewhere in the world where our products are distributed or licensed. Certain of our businesses are subject to heightened regulations. Specifically, certain of our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail businesses products are subject to continuous on-site inspections by the USDA. Such heightened regulatory scrutiny results in increased costs of operations and the potential for delays in product sales. In addition, there is some risk that product classifications could be changed by the regulators, which could result in significant fines, penalties, discontinued distribution and relabeling costs.\nGovernmental regulations also affect taxes and levies, tariffs, import and export restrictions, healthcare costs, energy sourcing and usage, environmental and sustainability actions and disclosures, competition, data privacy and security and related disclosures, immigration and labor issues, governmental assistance programs and incentives (as examples, the discontinuation of the heightened Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits that were put in place during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred during, and adversely impacted us in, fiscal 2023, and the resumption of student loan repayments that were temporarily suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, which occurred in October 2023) and other regulatory reforms, any or all of which may have a direct or indirect effect on our businesses or the businesses of our customers, suppliers or third-party manufacturers. In addition, we could be the target of claims relating to alleged false or deceptive advertising under federal, state and foreign laws and regulations and may be subject to initiatives to limit or prohibit the marketing and advertising of our products to children or products containing certain ingredients. We also may be impacted by changes to administrative policies, such as business restrictions, tariffs and trade agreements, in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products.\nThe impact of current laws and regulations, changes in these laws or regulations or interpretations thereof or the introduction of new laws or regulations could increase the costs of doing business for us or our customers, suppliers or third-party manufacturers, causing our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows to be adversely affected. As specific examples, some states have passed laws or enacted regulations, or may do so in the future, that mandate specific housing requirements for layer hens and mandate specific space requirements for farm animal enclosures, including layer hens and pigs, which have resulted, and may in the future result, in us incurring additional operating and capital costs. In addition, there is an\nincreased focus by foreign, federal, state and local regulatory and legislative bodies regarding environmental policies relating to packaging, environmental contaminants, climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and mandatory disclosures related to such topics. Compliance with any such legal or regulatory requirements may require us to make significant changes to our business operations, strategy, supply chain management and disclosures, which will likely require substantial time, attention and costs. The limited availability of government inspectors due to a government shutdown, government restrictions, public health crises or closed borders also could cause disruption to our manufacturing facilities. A government shutdown also could impact our ability to receive governmental approvals necessary for our businesses, such as labeling of new products.\nIt is possible that federal, state, local or foreign enforcement authorities might take regulatory or enforcement action, which could result in significant fines or penalties and revocations of required licenses or injunctions, as well as potential criminal sanctions. Even if we make changes to align ourselves with changing legal or regulatory requirements, we may still be subject to significant penalties if such laws and regulations are interpreted and applied in a manner inconsistent with our practices. If we are found to be significantly out of compliance with applicable laws, regulations or permits, an enforcement authority could issue a warning letter, institute enforcement actions or both, which could result in additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays in production or even a temporary shutdown in manufacturing and product sales while the non-conformances are rectified. Also, we may have to recall product or otherwise remove product from the market and temporarily cease its manufacture and distribution, which would increase our costs and reduce our revenues. Any claims, such as product liability or labeling claims, resulting from the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations would be expensive to defend and could result in substantial damage awards against us or harm our reputation. Any of these events would negatively impact our revenues and costs of operations.\nPending and future litigation may impair our reputation or cause us to incur significant costs.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to contracts, intellectual property, product recalls, product liability, the advertising, marketing, labeling or certification of products, employment matters, environmental matters, data privacy or security or other aspects of our business. Over the past several years, there has been an increase in lawsuits filed against food and beverage companies, as well as pet food companies, alleging deceptive advertising and labeling. Negative publicity resulting from allegations made in lawsuits or claims asserted against us, whether or not valid, may adversely affect our reputation or brands. In addition, we may incur substantial costs and fees in defending such actions or asserting our rights, be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The outcome of pending or future litigation is often difficult to predict and may have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have various insurance programs in place, the potential liabilities associated with these litigation matters, or those that could arise in the future, could be excluded from coverage or, if covered, could exceed the coverage provided by such programs. In addition, insurance carriers may seek to rescind or deny coverage with respect to pending or future claims or lawsuits. If we do not have sufficient coverage under our policies, or if coverage is denied, we may be required to make material payments to settle litigation or satisfy any judgment. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding personal information, data privacy, data protection and data security. Such laws, regulations, guidelines and principles impose varying obligations and requirements from country to country or, within the U.S., from state to state, which can create complexity in our compliance efforts. Our efforts to comply with such requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), require significant time and resources and impose significant challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar requirements. In addition, if a state or other jurisdiction where we have substantial operations were to adopt new requirements, we could incur substantial compliance costs. Failure to comply with these requirements or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing could result in substantial penalties or fines, regulatory proceedings, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to certain continuing obligations, including indemnification obligations and lease guarantor obligations, related to the sale of the Bob Evans restaurants business that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn April 2017, prior to our acquisition of Bob Evans, Bob Evans completed the sale and separation of its restaurants business (the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction) to Bob Evans Restaurants, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company formed by affiliates of Golden Gate Capital Opportunity Fund, L.P. (the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer), pursuant to a sale agreement between Bob Evans and the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer (the sale agreement, together with agreements related thereto, collectively referred to as the Restaurants Sale Agreement). As a result of our acquisition of Bob Evans, we have the obligation to indemnify the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer for certain breaches of the Restaurants Sale Agreement and certain other liabilities set forth in the Restaurants Sale Agreement.\nIn addition, in connection with the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction, the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed the lease obligations of the Bob Evans restaurants business. However, as part of a sale leaseback transaction of 143 of Bob Evanss restaurant properties that Bob Evans completed in 2016, Bob Evans and one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into payment and performance guarantees relating to the leases on such restaurant properties (the Guarantees), which remained in place after the completion of the Bob Evans Restaurants Transaction. The Guarantees have subsequently been adjusted to 130 properties. Although the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer assumed responsibility for the payment and performance obligations under the leases on the sale leaseback properties, under the terms of the Guarantees, we remain liable for payments due under any of the leases that remain in place if the Bob Evans Restaurants Buyer fails to satisfy its lease obligations where we do not otherwise have adequate defenses under the Guarantees, the lease agreements or applicable law. Any such unexpected expenses related to our obligations under the Guarantees or under the Restaurants Sale Agreement could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our trademarks, but also our patents, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and licenses, to be a significant and valuable asset to us. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as exclusive and nonexclusive licensing agreements, third-party nondisclosure, confidentiality and assignment agreements, confidentiality provisions in third-party agreements and the policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure or inability to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property rights, or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of intellectual property, may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our businesses. In addition, as certain of our trademarks, trade names and trade secrets are subject to licenses and are shared and used by third parties, negative events outside of our control could have an adverse impact on us and our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face the risk of claims that we have infringed third parties intellectual property rights. Any claims of intellectual property infringement, even those without merit, could be costly and time-consuming to defend; cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property; require us to redesign or rebrand our products or packaging, if feasible; divert managements attention and resources; or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a third partys intellectual property. Any royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, a successful claim of infringement against us could require us to pay significant damages, enter into costly license or royalty agreements or stop the sale of certain products, any or all of which could have a negative impact on our operating profits and harm our future prospects.\nTermination of our material intellectual property licenses could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe market certain of our products in the U.S., Canada, the U.K. and several other locations pursuant to intellectual property license agreements. These licenses give us the right to use certain names, characters and logos in connection with our products and to sell the products in certain regions. If we were to breach any material term of these license agreements and not timely cure the breach, the licensor could terminate the agreement. If the licensor were to terminate our rights to use the names, characters and logos for this reason or any other reason, or if a licensor decided not to renew a license agreement upon the expiration of the license term, the loss of such rights could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations that can impose significant costs and expose us to potential financial liabilities.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those limiting the discharge and release of pollutants into the environment and those regulating the transport, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes. Certain environmental laws and regulations can impose joint and several liability without regard to fault on responsible parties, including past and present owners\nand operators of sites, related to cleaning up sites at which hazardous materials were disposed of or released. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in severe fines and penalties by governments or courts of law and could result in negative publicity. In addition, future laws may more stringently regulate environmental matters, including greenhouse gas emissions, water use and wastewater management.\nFuture events, such as new or more stringent environmental laws and regulations, new environmental claims, the discovery of currently unknown environmental conditions requiring response action or more vigorous interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, might require us to incur increased costs, capital expenditures or other financial obligations that could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Missouri law may prevent or delay an acquisition of the Company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated articles of incorporation (as amended, the articles of incorporation), our amended and restated bylaws (the bylaws) and Missouri law contain provisions intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive and incentivizing prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions include, among others:\nour Board of Directors is divided into three classes with staggered terms;\nour Board of Directors fixes the number of members on the Board of Directors;\nelimination of the rights of our shareholders to act by written consent (except when such consent is unanimous) and to call shareholder meetings;\nrules regarding how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at shareholder meetings;\nthe right of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without shareholder approval;\nsupermajority vote requirements for certain amendments to our articles of incorporation;\nanti-takeover provisions of Missouri law which may prevent us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder, or which may deter third parties from acquiring amounts of our common stock above certain thresholds; and\nlimitations on the right of shareholders to remove directors.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nChanges in tax laws may adversely affect us, and the IRS, another taxing authority or a court may disagree with our tax positions, which may result in adverse effects on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions have been and may be subject to significant changes. There can be no assurance that future tax law changes will not increase the rate of the corporate income tax significantly; impose new limitations on deductions, credits or other tax benefits; or make other changes that may adversely affect the performance of an investment in us. Furthermore, there is no assurance that the IRS, another taxing authority or a court will agree with the positions taken by us, in which case tax penalties and interest may be imposed that could adversely affect our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, including value added tax, or other changes in the application of existing taxes, in markets in which we are currently active or may be active in the future, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks and uncertainties discussed in this report, announcements we make about our businesses, variations in our quarterly results of operations and those of our competitors, market data that is available to subscribers, reports by industry analysts, whether or not we meet the financial estimates of analysts who follow us, industry or market trends, investor perceptions, actions by credit rating agencies, future issuances or sales of our common stock, to the extent any Convertible Notes are converted into shares of our common stock or cash or negative developments relating to our customers, competitors or suppliers, as well as general economic and industry conditions, including periods of inflation, rising interest rates or recessions. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially reduce the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance.\nAs a result of such events or market volatility, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above the price at which they purchase our common stock. In addition, this market volatility may impact our ability to raise\ncapital through sales of our equity securities and may adversely affect the retentive power of our equity compensation plans, Further, in the past, some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to class action or derivative lawsuits. The filing of a lawsuit against us, regardless of the outcome, could have a negative effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as it could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources.\nIf we are unable to continue to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be questioned, and our stock price may suffer.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) requires any company subject to the reporting requirements of the U.S. securities laws to perform a comprehensive evaluation of its and its consolidated subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures, our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to issue an opinion on its audit of our internal control over financial reporting.\nThe rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards under the rules. During the course of its testing, our management may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies which may not be remedied in time to meet the annual deadline imposed by SOX. If our management cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm identifies material weaknesses in our internal controls, investor confidence in our financial results may weaken, and our stock price may consequently suffer. In addition, in the event that we do not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we might fail to timely prevent or detect potential financial misstatements. As discussed under the heading Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of this report, and subject to the permitted exclusion of certain elements of internal controls of Pet Food noted therein, as of September 30, 2023, management determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nA shareholders percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future.\nAs with any publicly-traded company, our shareholders percentage ownership in Post may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors, officers and employees and the vesting of those equity awards. For a brief discussion of our equity incentive plan, see Note 19 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. In addition, any Convertible Notes converted into shares of our common stock will dilute the ownership of our then existing shareholders.\nActions of shareholders could cause us to incur substantial costs, divert managements attention and resources and have an adverse effect on our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to proposals and other requests from shareholders urging us to take certain corporate actions, including proposals seeking to influence our corporate policies or effecting a change in our management. In the event of such shareholder proposals, particularly with respect to matters which our management and Board of Directors, in exercising their fiduciary duties, disagree with or have determined not to pursue, our businesses could be adversely affected because responding to actions and requests of shareholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees. Additionally, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified employees, business partners and customers.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources of Post Holdings, Inc. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under Item 8 of this report and the Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report. The terms our, we, us, Company and Post as used herein refer to Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nThe following should be read in conjunction with the discussion and analysis of our fiscal 2022 results compared to our fiscal 2021 results, including any related discussion of fiscal 2021 results and activity, which can be found in Item 7 under the title Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022, and such discussion and analysis is incorporated by reference herein.\nOn March 10, 2022, we completed the BellRing Spin-off (as defined below), which represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on our operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) and BellRing Distribution, LLC prior to the BellRing Spin-off have been presented as discontinued operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The following discussion reflects continuing operations only, unless otherwise indicated. See below for additional information.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a consumer packaged goods holding company, operating in four reportable segments: Post Consumer Brands, Weetabix, Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail. Our products are sold through a variety of channels, including grocery, club and drug stores, mass merchandisers, foodservice, food ingredient and eCommerce.\nAt September 30, 2023, our reportable segments were as follows:\nPost Consumer Brands: North American ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal, pet food and nut butters;\nWeetabix: primarily United Kingdom (the U.K.) RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based shakes;\nFoodservice: primarily egg and potato products; and\nRefrigerated Retail: primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products.\nTransactions\nPost Holdings Partnering Corporation\nIn May and June 2021, we and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (PHPC), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units and such transaction, the PHPC IPO), of which our wholly-owned subsidiary (PHPC Sponsor) purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consisted of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC (PHPC Series A Common Stock) and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0 million. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC was required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023, which could have been extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances (the Combination Period).\nSubstantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 million (the PHPC Private Placement). Each PHPC Private Placement Unit consisted of one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock and one-third of one redeemable warrant of PHPC to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants).\nIn addition, we, through PHPC Sponsors ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC (the PHPC Series F Common Stock), had certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPCs amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn connection with the PHPC IPO, PHPC incurred offering costs of $17.9 million, of which $10.7 million were deferred underwriting commissions that would have become payable to the underwriters solely in the event that PHPC completed a partnering transaction and were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022.\nProceeds of $345.0 million were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPCs public stockholders, which consisted of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. A minimum balance of $345.0 million, which\nrepresented the number of PHPC Units sold at the offering price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, was required by the underwriting agreement to be maintained in the trust account. These proceeds were invested only in United States (U.S.) treasury securities. At September 30, 2022, there was $346.8 million held in the trust account, which was included in Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe public stockholders ownership of PHPC equity represented a noncontrolling interest (NCI) to us, which was classified outside of permanent shareholders equity as the PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemable at the option of the public stockholders in certain circumstances. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was recorded at its redemption value of $306.6 million on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and prior to the PHPC Redemption (as defined below), we beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within our financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, which represented the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminated in consolidation.\nOn May 11, 2023, PHPC announced that it would not complete a partnering transaction within the Combination Period and that the entity would liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the terms of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Subsequent to the decision to liquidate and dissolve, PHPC completed certain winding-up activities, which included writing-off the deferred underwriting commissions as the underwriters agreed to waive their rights to these amounts should a partnering transaction not occur. We recorded a $10.7 million gain in connection with this write-off, which was recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nOn May 28, 2023, the PHPC Warrants and the PHPC Private Placement Warrants expired worthless, as PHPC had not completed a partnering transaction before the expiration of the Combination Period.\nOn May 30, 2023, PHPC redeemed all of the outstanding public shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock (the PHPC Redemption). Each share of PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemed for approximately $10.24 per share, representing the per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to pay taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock. In connection with the PHPC Redemption:\n$353.4 million of funds held in the trust account immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption were distributed to redeem all of the outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock, which reduced Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to zero as of September 30, 2023. We received $40.9 million from the PHPC Redemption related to our ownership of 4.0 million shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock; and\nredeemable NCI of $312.5 million immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption was reduced to zero on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023.\nSubsequent to the PHPC Redemption, PHPC delisted from the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) and dissolved in June 2023, and all classes of shares of PHPC equity were cancelled, including the PHPC Private Placement Units and the shares of PHPC Series F Common Stock, which were surrendered by PHPC Sponsor for no consideration. PHPC Sponsor subsequently dissolved in August 2023.\nBellRing Brands, Inc.\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Spin-off Agreement), by and among us, Old BellRing, BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), we contributed our share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share, all of our BellRing Brands, LLC non-voting membership units and $550.4 million of cash to BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing and the right to receive $840.0 million in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes, and such transactions, collectively, the BellRing Contribution).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and we distributed an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of our shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock), to our shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution (the BellRing Distribution). Our shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to our shareholders.\nUpon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing.\nThe transactions described above, including the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Distribution and the BellRing Merger, and the Debt-for-Debt Exchange described under Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section, are collectively referred to as the BellRing Spin-off.\nOur equity interest in BellRing subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off (our Investment in BellRing) was 14.2% immediately following the BellRing Spin-off. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock.\nOn August 11, 2022, we transferred 14.8 million shares of our Investment in BellRing to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of the First Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section).\nOn November 25, 2022, we transferred the remaining 4.6 million shares of our Investment in BellRing to repay certain outstanding debt obligations as part of the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange (as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources within this section). We owned no shares of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2023.\nWe incurred separation-related expenses of $0.1 million and $29.9 million during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the BellRing Spin-off and subsequent divestment of our Investment in BellRing. These expenses generally included third-party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees and were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFor additional information on the BellRing Spin-off and the transactions to subsequently divest of our Investment in BellRing, refer to Notes 4, 5 and 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAcquisitions\nOn April 28, 2023, we completed our acquisition of a portion of The J. M. Smucker Companys (Smucker) pet food business, including brands such as Rachael Ray Nutrish, Natures Recipe, 9Lives, Kibbles n Bits and Gravy Train, private label pet food assets and certain manufacturing and distribution facilities (collectively, Pet Food), which is reported in our Post Consumer Brands segment. In connection with the Pet Food acquisition, we entered into a transition services agreement with Smucker (the TSA) pursuant to which Smucker provides certain Pet Food support services to us for a transition period of 18 months (or up to 24 months at our election) following the close of the acquisition based on the terms set forth in the TSA. Pet Food receivables and payables are settled between us and Smucker monthly on a net basis per the terms of the TSA.\nWe completed the Lacka Foods Limited (Lacka Foods) acquisition on April 5, 2022, which is reported in our Weetabix segment.\nFor additional information on our acquisitions, refer to Note 6 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nDivestitures\nWe completed the sale of the Willamette Egg Farms business (the WEF Transaction) on December 1, 2021. Prior to the WEF Transaction, Willamette Egg Farms operating results were reported in our Refrigerated Retail segment.\nMarket and Company Trends\nOur Company, as well as the consumer packaged goods industry in which we operate, have been impacted by the following trends which have impacted our results of operations and may continue to impact our results of operations in the future, including:\ninflationary pressures, which have driven increased input costs and therefore pricing actions within each of our respective segments (refer to Commodity Trends and Seasonality section below);\nshifting consumer preferences from branded to private label or other value products as consumers continue to be impacted by rising costs, which has negatively impacted sales volumes within our Refrigerated Retail, Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments and driven shifts in product mix toward lower margin products within our Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments; and\noutbreaks of avian influenza during fiscal 2022 and early fiscal 2023, which impacted our Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments, and drove increased costs related to production inefficiencies, egg supply constraints and higher market-based egg prices, all of which were mitigated through volume management with customers and pricing actions.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended\nSeptember 30, Change in\ndollars in millions 2023 2022 Dollars\nPercentage\nNet Sales\n$ 6,991.0 $ 5,851.2 $ 1,139.8 19 %\nOperating Profit $ 598.9 $ 415.6 $ 183.3 44 %\nInterest expense, net 279.1 317.8 (38.7) (12) %\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net (40.5) (72.6) 32.1 44 %\nIncome on swaps, net (39.9) (268.0) 228.1 85 %\nGain on investment in BellRing (5.1) (437.1) 432.0 99 %\nOther income, net (7.6) (19.8) 12.2 62 %\nIncome tax expense 99.7 85.7 14.0 16 %\nEquity method loss, net of tax 0.3 67.1 (66.8) (100) %\nLess: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 11.6 7.5 4.1 55 %\nNet earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interest - 21.6 (21.6) (100) %\nNet Earnings $ 301.3 $ 756.6 $ (455.3) (60) %\nNet Sales\nNet sales increased $1,139.8 million, or 19%, during the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. This increase was due to higher net sales within our Post Consumer Brands, Foodservice and Weetabix segments, partially offset by lower net sales in our Refrigerated Retail segment. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nOperating Profit\nOperating profit increased $183.3 million, or 44%, during the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. This increase was driven by higher segment profit within our Foodservice, Post Consumer Brands and Refrigerated Retail segments, partially offset by a goodwill impairment charge of $42.2 million related to our Cheese and Dairy reporting unit, lower segment profit within our Weetabix segment and increased general corporate expenses. For further discussion, refer to Segment Results within this section.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense decreased $38.7 million, or 12%, for the year ended September 30, 2023, when compared to the prior year. The decrease was driven by lower average outstanding principal amounts of debt, increased interest income primarily on our investments held in trust prior to the PHPC Redemption and a lower weighted-average interest rate when compared to fiscal 2022. Our weighted-average interest rate on our total outstanding debt was 4.9% and 5.0% for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nFor additional information on our debt, refer to Note 16 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report and Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, among others. For additional discussion of these risks, refer to Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements on page 1 of this report and Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nCommodity Price Risk\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials, including ingredients and packaging, energy and fuel. The Company may use futures contracts and options to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so. A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the market price of the Companys principal hedged commodities, including natural gas, heating oil, soybean oil, corn, wheat and dairy, would have decreased the fair value of the Companys commodity-related derivatives portfolio by approximately $5 million and $7 million as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. This volatility analysis ignores changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged transactions. Because the Company does not hold or trade derivatives for speculation or profit, all changes in derivative values are effectively offset by corresponding changes in the underlying commodity exposures.\nFor more information regarding the Companys commodity derivative contracts, refer to Note 13 within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nAudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID 238)\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity for the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Post Holdings, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded certain elements of the internal control over financial reporting of the acquired pet food business (Pet Food) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination in the period ended September 30, 2023. Subsequent to the acquisition, certain elements of Pet Foods internal control over financial reporting and related processes were integrated into the Companys existing systems and internal control over financial reporting. Those controls that were not integrated have been excluded from managements assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023. We have also excluded these elements of the internal control over financial reporting of Pet Food from our audit of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. The excluded elements represent controls over approximately 2% or $223.5 million of consolidated assets and 10% or $679.8 million of the consolidated net sales.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of Pet Food - Valuation of Customer Relationships and Trademarks and Licensing Agreements\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on April 28, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition of a portion of The J. M. Smucker Companys pet food business (Pet Food) for net consideration of $1,207.5 million. Of the acquired intangible assets, $235.0 million of trademarks and licensing agreements and $391.0 million of customer relationships were recorded. As disclosed by management, the intangible assets acquired, including customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements, are valued using an income-based approach. The income approach utilizes inputs that require significant assumptions for each identifiable intangible asset, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, attrition rate, royalty rates, and economic lives.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements acquired, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue growth, profitability, discount rate, attrition rate, and economic life for customer relationships and future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for trademarks and licensing agreements, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over managements valuation of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements acquired, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approaches used to estimate fair value, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approaches, and (v) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenue growth, profitability, discount rate, attrition rate and economic life for customer relationships and future revenue growth, profitability, discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for tradenames and licensing agreements. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue growth and profitability for customer relationships and trademarks and licensing agreements involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Pet Food business, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Companys income approaches, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate, attrition rate, and economic life for customer relationships and the discount rates, royalty rates, and economic lives for trademarks and licensing agreements.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - Weetabix Reporting Unit Within the Weetabix Segment and Cheese and Dairy Reporting Unit Within the Refrigerated Retail Segment\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 30, 2023, the Companys goodwill balance was $4,574.4 million, of which the goodwill associated with the Refrigerated Retail and Weetabix segments was $712.8 million and $854.3 million, respectively. The Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment and the Weetabix reporting unit within the Weetabix segment each make up a certain portion and a significant portion of the\nrespective segments. Management conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Management recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $42.2 million related to the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit driven primarily by narrowing of the pricing gap between branded and private label competitors, resulting in distribution losses and declining profitability. Additionally, as of September 30, 2023, the Weetabix reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6.4% and was impacted by raw material and energy cost inflation as well as U.K. economic pressures negatively impacting consumer spending trends, both of which impacted near-term profitability. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA, which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples based on market data for comparable peers.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the Weetabix reporting unit within the Weetabix segment and the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Weetabix and Cheese and Dairy reporting units, (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Weetabix and the Cheese and Dairy reporting units. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimates, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income and market approaches used to estimate fair value, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the approaches, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to future revenue, profitability, the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples. Evaluating managements significant assumptions related to future revenue and profitability involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Weetabix and Cheese and Dairy reporting units, (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data, and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Companys income and market approaches, and (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rates, the revenue market multiples and the EBITDA market multiples assumptions.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSt. Louis, Missouri\nNovember 17, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2011.\nPOST HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(in millions, except per share data)\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet Sales $ 6,991.0 $ 5,851.2 $ 4,980.7\nCost of goods sold 5,109.3 4,383.7 3,552.6\nGross Profit 1,881.7 1,467.5 1,428.1\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 1,078.4 904.7 807.0\nAmortization of intangible assets 160.7 146.0 143.2\nImpairment of goodwill\n42.2 - -\nOther operating expense (income), net 1.5 1.2 (9.8)\nOperating Profit 598.9 415.6 487.7\nInterest expense, net 279.1 317.8 332.6\n(Gain) loss on extinguishment of debt, net (40.5) (72.6) 93.2\nIncome on swaps, net\n(39.9) (268.0) (122.8)\nGain on investment in BellRing (5.1) (437.1) -\nOther income, net (7.6) (19.8) (29.3)\nEarnings before Income Taxes and Equity Method Loss 412.9 895.3 214.0\nIncome tax expense 99.7 85.7 58.2\nEquity method loss, net of tax 0.3 67.1 43.9\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations, Including Noncontrolling Interests\n312.9 742.5 111.9\nLess: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 11.6 7.5 7.0\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations 301.3 735.0 104.9\nNet earnings from discontinued operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interest - 21.6 61.8\nNet Earnings $ 301.3 $ 756.6 $ 166.7\nEarnings from Continuing Operations per Common Share:\nBasic $ 5.21 $ 12.07 $ 1.46\nDiluted $ 4.82 $ 11.75 $ 1.44\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations per Common Share:\nBasic $ - $ 0.35 $ 0.96\nDiluted $ - $ 0.34 $ 0.94\nEarnings per Common Share:\nBasic $ 5.21 $ 12.42 $ 2.42\nDiluted $ 4.82 $ 12.09 $ 2.38\nWeighted-Average Common Shares Outstanding:\nBasic 60.0 60.9 64.2\nDiluted 67.0 62.7 65.3\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPOST HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(in millions)\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nNet Earnings $ 301.3 $ 756.6 $ 166.7\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests from continuing operations 11.6 7.5 7.0\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest from discontinued operations - 11.8 33.0\nNet Earnings Including Noncontrolling Interests 312.9 775.9 206.7\nPension and postretirement benefits adjustments:\nUnrealized pension and postretirement benefit obligations 3.4 (24.0) (8.1)\nReclassifications to net earnings (4.8) (1.9) (0.6)\nHedging adjustments:\nReclassifications to net earnings - 7.1 2.3\nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nUnrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 126.4 (293.9) 77.4\nTax benefit (expense) on other comprehensive income:\nPension and postretirement benefits adjustments:\nUnrealized pension and postretirement benefit obligations (0.3) 6.7 1.9\nReclassifications to net earnings 1.1 0.4 0.2\nHedging adjustments:\nReclassifications to net earnings - (1.8) (0.6)\nTotal Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) Including Noncontrolling Interests\n$ 125.8 $ (307.4) $ 72.5\nLess: Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests 9.6 20.0 40.3\nTotal Comprehensive Income $ 429.1 $ 448.5 $ 238.9\nSee accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPOST HOLDINGS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(in millions, except par value)\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$ 93.3 $ 586.5\nRestricted cash\n23.9 3.6\nReceivables, net\n512.4 544.2\nInventories\n789.9 549.1\nInvestment in BellRing - 94.8\nInvestments held in trust - 346.8\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n59.0 98.4\nTotal Current Assets\n1,478.5 2,223.4\nProperty, net 2,021.4 1,751.9\nGoodwill 4,574.4 4,349.6\nOther intangible assets, net 3,212.4 2,712.2\nOther assets 360.0 270.9\nTotal Assets\n$ 11,646.7 $ 11,308.0\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nCurrent Liabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$ 1.1 $ 1.1\nAccounts payable\n368.8 452.7\nOther current liabilities\n435.4 370.0\nTotal Current Liabilities\n805.3 823.8\nLong-term debt 6,039.0 5,956.6\nDeferred income taxes 674.4 688.4\nOther liabilities 276.7 266.9\nTotal Liabilities\n7,795.4 7,735.7\nCommitments and Contingencies (See Note 17)\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest - 306.6\nShareholders Equity\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value, 50.0 shares authorized;

The Post Consumer Brands segment includes North American ready-to-eat (RTE) cereal, pet food and nut butters products; the Weetabix segment includes primarily United Kingdom (U.K.) RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based shake products; the Foodservice segment includes primarily egg and potato products; and the Refrigerated Retail segment includes primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products.\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise indicates, all references in these financial statements and notes to Post, the Company, us, our or we mean Post Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOn March 10, 2022, the Company completed its distribution of 80.1% of its ownership interest in BellRing Brands, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Distribution, LLC) (BellRing) to Posts shareholders (the BellRing Distribution, and such transaction, as well as the BellRing Contribution, the BellRing Merger (as such terms are defined in Note 4), the Debt-for-Debt Exchange (as such term is defined in Note 16) and the related transactions described in Note 4, the BellRing Spin-off). The BellRing Spin-off represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Companys operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of BellRing Intermediate Holdings, Inc. (formerly known as BellRing Brands, Inc.) (Old BellRing) and BellRing Distribution, LLC prior to the BellRing Spin-off have been presented as discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise indicated. See Note 4 for additional information regarding the BellRing Spin-off and discontinued operations.\nThe Company completed its acquisitions of the Egg Beaters liquid egg brand (Egg Beaters) and the Peter Pan nut butter brand (Peter Pan) on May 27, 2021 and January 25, 2021, respectively. The year-end close date for both Egg Beaters and Peter Pan was September 26, 2021. As the amounts associated with the additional four days were immaterial, results of these entities were not adjusted to conform with Posts fiscal calendar in fiscal 2021.\nCertain reclassifications have been made to previously reported financial information to conform to the Companys current period presentation.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the operations of Post and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates and Allocations - The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which require certain elections as to accounting policy, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amount of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant accounting policy elections, estimates and assumptions include, among others, allowance for trade promotions, business combinations, pension and benefit plan assumptions, valuation assumptions of goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nBusiness Combinations - The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Companys financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the date of acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Useful lives of identified tangible and intangible assets are determined based on the expected time period in which the cash flows of the related assets are expected to be realized. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired over the purchase price is recorded as a gain on bargain purchase.\nThe Company utilizes various valuation methodologies (and depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition, assistance from third-party specialists) to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the nature of the underlying asset or liability. These methodologies include but are not limited to utilizing replacement cost, comparative sales and market- and income-based approaches. The income approach utilizes significant unobservable inputs, including revenue growth rates, discount rates, attrition rates and royalty rates. These fair value measurements fall within Level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy as described in Note 14. During the measurement period, up to twelve months from the date of acquisition, subsequent changes may be made to adjust the preliminary amounts recognized at the acquisition date to their subsequently determined acquisition-date fair values.\nCash Equivalents - Cash equivalents include all highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months.\nRestricted Cash - Restricted cash includes cash deposits which serve as collateral for certain commodity and energy hedging contracts as well as the Companys high deductible workers compensation insurance program.\nReceivables - Receivables are reported net of appropriate allowances for credit losses, cash discounts and other amounts which the Company does not ultimately expect to collect. To calculate an allowance for credit losses, the Company estimates uncollectible amounts based on a review of past due balances, historical loss information and expectations regarding potential future losses. A receivable is considered past due if payments have not been received within the agreed upon invoice terms. Receivables are written off against the allowance when the customer files for bankruptcy protection or are otherwise deemed to be uncollectible based upon the Companys evaluation of the customers solvency. As of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not have off-balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers. The Weetabix segment sells certain receivables to a third-party institution without recourse. Receivables sold during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 were $92.5 and $111.7, respectively. See Note 6 for information regarding the Companys monthly settlement of receivables and payables with a third party in connection with its fiscal 2023 acquisition.\nInventories - Inventories, other than flocks, are generally valued at the lower of cost (determined on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Reported amounts have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete product and packaging materials based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales. Flock inventory represents the cost of purchasing and raising chicken flocks to egg laying maturity. The costs included in our flock inventory include the costs of the chicks, the feed fed to the birds and the labor and overhead costs incurred to operate the pullet facilities until the birds are transferred into the laying facilities, at which time their cost is amortized to operations, as cost of goods sold, over their expected useful lives of one to two years.\nRestructuring Expenses - Restructuring charges and related charges principally consist of one-time termination benefits, severance, contract termination benefits, accelerated stock compensation and other employee separation costs. The Company recognizes restructuring obligations and liabilities for exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period the liability is incurred. Employee severance costs are expensed when they become probable and reasonably estimable under established severance plans.\nProperty - Property is recorded at cost, and depreciation expense is generally provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the properties. Estimated useful lives range from 1 to 30 years for machinery and equipment; 1 to 35 years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements; and 1 to 7 years for software. Total depreciation expense was $245.3, $232.9 and $222.2 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any gains and losses incurred on the sale or disposal of assets are included in Other operating expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are accounted for under the direct expensing method. Property consisted of:\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nLand and land improvements $ 109.9 $ 92.2\nBuildings and leasehold improvements 1,042.9 932.7\nMachinery and equipment 2,312.2 1,951.1\nSoftware 113.3 110.6\nConstruction in progress 191.1 182.7\n3,769.4 3,269.3\nAccumulated depreciation (1,748.0) (1,517.4)\n$ 2,021.4 $ 1,751.9\nGoodwill - Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets and represents the value the Company expects to achieve through the implementation of operational synergies, the expansion of the business into new or growing segments of the industry and the addition of new employees. The Company conducts a goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment assessment performed may be either qualitative or quantitative; however, if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for all reporting units.\nThe Company has six reporting units, which have been identified at either the operating segment level, or in the case of certain reporting units, at a level below the operating segment. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach. The income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue, profitability, capital requirements and discount rates. The market approach is based on a market multiple (revenue and EBITDA) and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data for comparable peers. These fair value measurements fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 14.\nSee Note 8 for additional information on goodwill and the annual goodwill impairment assessments for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nOther Intangible Assets - Other intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, trademarks, brands and licensing agreements acquired in business combinations and include both indefinite and definite-lived assets. Amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets, which is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, was $160.7, $146.0 and $143.2 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For the definite-lived intangible assets recorded as of September 30, 2023, amortization expense of $179.9, $178.7, $178.7, $178.7 and $173.5 is expected for fiscal 2024, 2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028, respectively. Other intangible assets consisted of:\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nCarrying\nAmount Accum.\nAmort. Net\nAmount Carrying\nAmount Accum.\nAmort. Net\nAmount\nSubject to amortization:\nCustomer relationships\n$ 2,535.5 $ (940.7) $ 1,594.8 $ 2,129.7 $ (816.4) $ 1,313.3\nTrademarks, brands and licensing agreements 885.8 (301.3) 584.5 647.7 (260.4) 387.3\n3,421.3 (1,242.0) 2,179.3 2,777.4 (1,076.8) 1,700.6\nNot subject to amortization:\nTrademarks and brands\n1,033.1 - 1,033.1 1,011.6 - 1,011.6\n$ 4,454.4 $ (1,242.0) $ 3,212.4 $ 3,789.0 $ (1,076.8) $ 2,712.2\nRecoverability of Assets - The Company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred which might impair the recoverability of the carrying value of its assets, including property, identifiable intangibles and right-of-use (ROU) assets.\nTrademarks and brands with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trademark or brand may be impaired. The trademark and brand impairment test performed may either be qualitative or quantitative; however, if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the trademark or brand, a quantitative impairment test is performed. In fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test.\nThe quantitative trademark and brand impairment tests require the Company to compare the calculated fair value of the trademark or brand to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The fair value is determined using an income-based approach, which requires significant assumptions for each brand, including estimates regarding future revenue growth, discount rates and royalty rates. Assumptions are determined after consideration of several factors for each brand, including profit levels, research of external royalty rates by third-party experts and the relative importance of each brand to the Company. Revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and managements expectations for future growth by brand. The discount rate is based on a weighted-average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies.\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company performed a quantitative impairment test for all indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded for each year there were no impairments. The estimated fair value of all indefinite-lived trademarks exceeded book value by 11% or greater, 23% or greater and 22% or greater at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These fair value measurements fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as described in Note 14.\nIn addition, definite-lived assets (groups) are tested for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset (group) may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life is no longer appropriate. The Company groups assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identifiable. In general, an asset (group) is deemed impaired and written down to its fair value if the estimated related undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying amount. There were no impairments recorded on the Companys definite-lived assets (groups) in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nSoftware Implementation Costs - For hosting arrangements that are service contracts, the Company capitalizes certain implementation costs incurred during the development stage of the related project. Capitalized software implementation costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the hosting service arrangement, beginning when the software is ready for its intended use. Total capitalized software implementation costs for hosting service arrangements are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $20.4 and $7.6 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no material capitalized software implementation costs expensed in fiscal 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nDeferred Compensation Investments - The Company funds a portion of its deferred compensation liability by investing in certain mutual funds in substantially the same amounts as selected by the participating employees. Because managements intent is to invest in a manner that matches the deferral options chosen by the participants and those participants can elect to transfer amounts into or out of each of the designated deferral options at any time, these investments are stated at fair value in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 14). Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these assets are generally included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the related change in the deferred compensation liability.\nDerivative Financial Instruments - In the ordinary course of business, the Company is exposed to commodity price risks relating to the purchases of raw materials and supplies, interest rate risks and foreign currency exchange rate risks. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including (but not limited to) futures contracts, option contracts, forward contracts and swaps, to manage certain of these exposures by hedging when it is practical to do so. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.\nThe Companys derivative programs may include strategies that qualify and strategies that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship, both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged risk during the period that the hedge is designated. All derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, the derivative is designated as a hedge on the date in which the derivative contract is entered. A derivative could be designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. Some derivatives may also be considered natural hedging instruments, where changes in their fair value act as economic offsets to changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item and are not designated for hedge accounting.\nGains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss (OCI) and are reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in conjunction with the recognition of the underlying hedged item. If a derivative is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, its changes in fair value are recorded in OCI and subsequently recognized in earnings when the foreign operation is liquidated. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognized immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company does not have any derivatives currently designated as hedging instruments under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging.\nCash flows associated with all derivatives are reported as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, unless the derivative contains an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case its cash flows are reported as cash flows from financing activities.\nLeases - The Company leases office space, certain warehouses and equipment primarily through operating lease agreements. The Company has no material finance lease agreements. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. When the arrangements include lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for them as a single lease component. Leases with an initial term of less than 12 months are not reported on the balance sheet, but rather are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Arrangements may include options to extend or terminate the lease arrangement. These options are included in the lease term used to establish ROU assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised. The Company will reassess expected lease terms based on changes in circumstances that indicate options may be more or less likely to be exercised.\nThe Company has certain lease arrangements that include variable rental payments. The future variability of these payments and adjustments are unknown and therefore are not included in minimum rental payments used to determine ROU assets and lease liabilities. The Company has lease arrangements where it makes separate payments to the lessor based on the lessors common area maintenance expenses, property and casualty insurance costs, property taxes assessed on the property and other variable expenses. As the Company has elected the practical expedient not to separate lease and non-lease components, these variable amounts are captured in operating lease expense in the period in which they are incurred. Variable rental payments are recognized in the period in which their associated obligation is incurred.\nFor lease arrangements that do not provide an implicit interest rate, an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) is applied in determining the present value of future payments. The Companys IBR is selected based upon information available at the lease commencement date.\nROU assets are recorded as Other assets and lease liabilities are recorded as Other current liabilities and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Costs associated with finance leases do not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements.\nRevenue - The Company recognizes revenue when performance obligations have been satisfied by transferring control of the goods to customers. Control is generally transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer. At the time of delivery, the customer is invoiced using previously agreed-upon credit terms. Shipping and/or handling costs that occur before the customer obtains control of the goods are deemed fulfillment activities and are accounted for as fulfillment costs. The Companys contracts with customers generally contain one performance obligation.\nMany of the Companys contracts with customers include some form of variable consideration. The most common forms of variable consideration are trade promotions, rebates and discounts. Variable consideration is treated as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenue is recognized. Depending on the nature of the variable consideration, the Company uses either the expected value or the most likely amount method to determine variable consideration. The Company does not believe that there will be significant changes to its estimates of variable consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers. The Company reviews and updates estimates of variable consideration quarterly. Uncertainties related to the estimates of variable consideration are resolved in a short time frame and do not require any additional constraint on variable consideration.\nThe Companys products are sold with no right of return, except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged. No services beyond this assurance-type warranty are provided to customers. Customer remedies include either a cash refund or an exchange of the product. As a result, the right of return and related refund liability is estimated and recorded as a reduction of revenue based on historical sales return experience.\nCost of Goods Sold - Cost of goods sold includes, among other things, inbound and outbound freight costs (including for the Company-owned fleets) and depreciation expense related to assets used in production, while storage and other warehousing costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Storage and other warehousing costs totaled $263.2, $204.0 and $167.7 in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nAdvertising - Advertising costs are expensed as incurred except for costs of producing media advertising, such as television commercials or magazine or online advertisements, which are deferred until the first time the advertising takes place and amortized to the statement of operations over the time the advertising takes place. The amounts reported as assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Prepaid expenses and other current assets were $1.3 and $1.4 as of September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nStock-based Compensation - The Company recognizes the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the equity or liability award. For liability awards, the fair market value is remeasured at each quarterly reporting period. The cost for equity and liability awards is recognized ratably over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award - the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). Any forfeitures of stock-based awards are recorded as they occur.\nIncome Taxes - Income tax expense is estimated based on income taxes in each jurisdiction and includes the effects of both current tax exposures and the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established against the related deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that the future benefits will not be realized. Reserves are recorded for estimated exposures associated with the Companys tax filing positions, which are subject to periodic audits by governmental taxing authorities. Interest incurred due to an underpayment of income taxes is classified as income tax expense. The Company considers the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently invested, so no United States (U.S.) taxes have been recorded in relation to the Companys investment in its foreign subsidiaries.\nEarnings per Share - The Company has presented basic and diluted earnings per share for both continuing and discontinued operations. Basic earnings per share is based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share is based on the average number of shares used for the basic earnings per share calculation, adjusted for the dilutive effect of stock options, stock appreciation rights and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method and convertible senior notes using the if-converted method.\nRemeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest (NCI) (see Note 5) were recognized as a deemed dividend. The Company made an election to treat the portion of the deemed dividend that exceeded fair value as an adjustment to income available to common shareholders for basic and diluted earnings from continuing operations per share. In\naddition, dilutive net earnings from continuing operations was adjusted for interest expense, net of tax, related to the Companys convertible senior notes, and dilutive net earnings from discontinued operations was adjusted for the Companys share of Old BellRings consolidated net earnings prior to the BellRing Spin-off, to the extent it was dilutive. Net earnings from continuing operations was utilized as the control number to determine whether potential shares of common stock were dilutive or anti-dilutive.\nNOTE 3 - RECENTLY ISSUED AND ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe Company has considered all new accounting pronouncements and has concluded there are no new pronouncements that had or will have a material impact on the Companys results of operations, comprehensive income, financial condition, cash flows, shareholders equity or related disclosures based on current information.\nNOTE 4 - BELLRING SPIN-OFF AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nBellRing Spin-off\nOn March 9, 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 26, 2021 (as amended by Amendment No. 1 to the Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 28, 2022, the Spin-off Agreement), by and among Post, Old BellRing, BellRing and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing (BellRing Merger Sub), Post contributed its share of Old BellRing Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share, all of its BellRing Brands, LLC non-voting membership units and $550.4 of cash to BellRing in exchange for certain limited liability company interests of BellRing and the right to receive $840.0 in aggregate principal amount of BellRings 7.00% senior notes maturing in 2030 (the BellRing Notes, and such transactions, collectively, the BellRing Contribution).\nOn March 10, 2022, BellRing converted into a Delaware corporation and changed its name to BellRing Brands, Inc., and Post consummated the BellRing Distribution, distributing an aggregate of 78.1 million, or 80.1%, of its shares of BellRing common stock, $0.01 par value per share (BellRing Common Stock), to Post shareholders of record as of the close of business, Central Time, on February 25, 2022 (the Record Date) in a pro-rata distribution. Post shareholders received 1.267788 shares of BellRing Common Stock for every one share of Post common stock held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock were issued, and instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to Post shareholders.\nUpon completion of the BellRing Distribution, BellRing Merger Sub merged with and into Old BellRing (the BellRing Merger), with Old BellRing continuing as the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BellRing.\nThe Companys equity interest in BellRing subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off (its Investment in BellRing) was 14.2% immediately following the BellRing Spin-off. As a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the dual class voting structure in the BellRing business was eliminated. The BellRing Distribution was structured in a manner intended to qualify as a tax-free distribution to Post shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, except to the extent of any cash received in lieu of fractional shares of BellRing Common Stock.\nThe Company incurred separation-related expenses related to the BellRing Spin-off and subsequent divestment of its Investment in BellRing (see Note 5) of $0.1, $29.9 and $1.6 during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which were included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These expenses generally included third-party costs for advisory services, fees charged by other service providers and government filing fees.\nOn March 17, 2022, the Company utilized proceeds received in connection with the BellRing Spin-off to redeem a portion of Posts existing 5.75% senior notes (see Note 16).\nThe following is a summary of BellRings net assets as of March 10, 2022.\nTotal Assets $ 633.0\nLess: Total Liabilities\n1,064.6\nBellRing Net Assets\n$ (431.6)\nAs a result of the BellRing Spin-off, the Company recorded a $442.5 adjustment to additional paid-in capital, which included BellRing net assets of $(431.6). The BellRing Spin-off also resulted in a reduction of accumulated OCI associated with BellRings foreign currency translation adjustments. The total adjustment to accumulated OCI was $2.3.\nThe Companys Investment in BellRing immediately following the BellRing Spin-off did not represent a controlling interest in BellRing. As such, the Companys remaining proportionate share of BellRings net assets was recorded at a zero carrying value on March 10, 2022, as the BellRing net assets were negative. See Note 14 for additional information regarding\nthe Companys subsequent remeasurement of its Investment in BellRing to fair value for the periods subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off.\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe BellRing Spin-off represented a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Companys operations and consolidated financial results. Accordingly, the historical results of Old BellRing and BellRing Distribution, LLC prior to the BellRing Spin-off have been presented as discontinued operations in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nThe following table presents the components of net earnings from discontinued operations. The year ended September 30, 2022 represents the period ending March 10, 2022, the completion date of the BellRing Spin-off.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nNet Sales $ 541.9 $ 1,246.0\nCost of goods sold 390.3 859.8\nGross Profit 151.6 386.2\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 68.5 167.1\nAmortization of intangible assets 8.7 51.2\nOther operating income, net - (0.1)\nOperating Profit 74.4 168.0\nInterest expense, net 13.1 43.2\nLoss on extinguishment and refinancing of debt, net 17.6 1.6\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations before Income Taxes 43.7 123.2\nIncome tax expense 10.3 28.4\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Including Noncontrolling Interest 33.4 94.8\nLess: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest from discontinued operations 11.8 33.0\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of tax and noncontrolling interest $ 21.6 $ 61.8\nNOTE 5 - NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EQUITY INTERESTS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPost Holdings Partnering Corporation\nIn May and June 2021, the Company and Post Holdings Partnering Corporation (PHPC), a special purpose acquisition company, consummated the initial public offering of 34.5 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Units, and such transaction, the PHPC IPO), of which a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (PHPC Sponsor) purchased 4.0 million PHPC Units. Each PHPC Unit consisted of one share of Series A common stock of PHPC (PHPC Series A Common Stock) and one-third of one redeemable warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share (the PHPC Warrants). The PHPC Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, generating gross proceeds to PHPC of $345.0. The PHPC Units, PHPC Series A Common Stock and PHPC Warrants each traded on the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE) under the ticker symbols PSPC.U, PSPC and PSPC WS, respectively. Under the terms of the PHPC IPO, PHPC was required to consummate a partnering transaction by May 28, 2023, which could have been extended to August 28, 2023 in certain circumstances (the Combination Period).\nSubstantially concurrently with the closing of the PHPC IPO, PHPC completed the private sale of 1.1 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Private Placement Units), at a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Private Placement Unit, to PHPC Sponsor, generating proceeds to PHPC of $10.9 (the PHPC Private Placement). The PHPC Private Placement Units sold in the PHPC Private Placement were identical to the PHPC Units sold in the PHPC IPO, except that, with respect to the warrants underlying the PHPC Private Placement Units (the PHPC Private Placement Warrants) that were held by PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, such PHPC Private Placement Warrants (i) could have been exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, (ii) were not subject to being called for redemption (except in certain circumstances if the PHPC Warrants were called for redemption and a certain price per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock threshold was met) and (iii) subject to certain limited exceptions, would have been subject to transfer restrictions until 30 days following the consummation of PHPCs partnering transaction. If the PHPC Private Placement Warrants were held by holders other than PHPC Sponsor or its permitted transferees, the PHPC Private Placement Warrants would have been redeemable by PHPC in all redemption scenarios and exercisable by holders on the same basis as the PHPC Warrants.\nIn addition, the Company, through PHPC Sponsors ownership of 8.6 million shares of Series F common stock of PHPC (the PHPC Series F Common Stock), had certain governance rights in PHPC relating to the election of PHPC directors and voting rights on amendments to PHPCs amended and restated certificate of incorporation.\nIn connection with the completion of the PHPC IPO, PHPC also entered into a forward purchase agreement with PHPC Sponsor (the Forward Purchase Agreement), which provided for the purchase by PHPC Sponsor, at the election of PHPC, of up to 10.0 million units of PHPC (the PHPC Forward Purchase Units), subject to the terms and conditions of the Forward Purchase Agreement, with each PHPC Forward Purchase Unit consisting of one share of PHPCs Series B common stock and one-third of one warrant to purchase one share of PHPC Series A Common Stock, for a purchase price of $10.00 per PHPC Forward Purchase Unit, in an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 in a private placement to occur concurrently with the closing of PHPCs partnering transaction.\nIn determining the accounting treatment of the Companys equity interest in PHPC, management concluded that PHPC was a variable interest entity (VIE) as defined by ASC Topic 810, Consolidation. A VIE is an entity in which equity investors at risk lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. VIEs are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, the party who has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. PHPC Sponsor was the primary beneficiary of PHPC as it had, through its equity interest, the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses from PHPC, as well as the power to direct a majority of the activities that significantly impacted PHPCs economic performance, including partnering transaction target identification. As such, PHPC was fully consolidated into the Companys financial statements until the time of its dissolution, as discussed below.\nProceeds of $345.0 were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of PHPCs public stockholders, which consisted of certain proceeds from the PHPC IPO and certain proceeds from the PHPC Private Placement, net of underwriters discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses. A minimum balance of $345.0, which represented the number of PHPC Units sold at the offering price of $10.00 per PHPC Unit, was required by the underwriting agreement to be maintained in the trust account. These proceeds were invested only in U.S. treasury securities. At September 30, 2022, there was $346.8 held in the trust account, which was included in Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe public stockholders ownership of PHPC equity represented a NCI to the Company, which was classified outside of permanent shareholders equity as the PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemable at the option of the public stockholders in certain circumstances. The carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was equal to the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the redeemable NCIs share of PHPCs net earnings or loss, OCI and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. The redemption value represented the amount the public stockholders of PHPC Series A Common Stock would be entitled in certain circumstances to redeem their shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock for, which was a pro-rata portion of the amount in the trust account at $10.00 per share of PHPC Series A Common Stock held, plus any pro-rata interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest was net of taxes payable, and less up to $0.1 of interest to pay dissolution expenses). As of September 30, 2022, the carrying amount of the redeemable NCI was recorded at its redemption value of $306.6 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable NCI were recognized as a deemed dividend and were recorded to Retained earnings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn connection with the PHPC IPO, PHPC incurred offering costs of $17.9, of which $16.9 was recorded to the redeemable NCI and $1.0 was reported in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2021. Of the $17.9 offering costs incurred, $10.7 were deferred underwriting commissions that would have become payable to the underwriters solely in the event that PHPC completed a partnering transaction and were included in Other current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and prior to the PHPC Redemption (as defined below), the Company beneficially owned 31.0% of the equity of PHPC and the net earnings and net assets of PHPC were consolidated within the Companys financial statements. The remaining 69.0% of the consolidated net earnings and net assets of PHPC, which represented the percentage of economic interest in PHPC held by the public stockholders of PHPC through their ownership of PHPC equity, were allocated to redeemable NCI. All transactions between PHPC and PHPC Sponsor, as well as related financial statement impacts, eliminated in consolidation.\nOn May 11, 2023, PHPC announced that it would not complete a partnering transaction within the Combination Period and that the entity would liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the terms of its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Subsequent to the decision to liquidate and dissolve, PHPC completed certain winding-up activities, which included writing-off the deferred underwriting commissions as the underwriters agreed to waive their rights to these amounts should a partnering transaction not occur. The Company recorded a $10.7 gain in connection with this write-off, which was recorded in Other income, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nOn May 28, 2023, the PHPC Warrants and the PHPC Private Placement Warrants expired worthless and the Forward Purchase Agreement terminated in accordance with its terms, as PHPC had not completed a partnering transaction before the expiration of the Combination Period.\nOn May 30, 2023, PHPC redeemed all of the outstanding public shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock (the PHPC Redemption). Each share of PHPC Series A Common Stock was redeemed for approximately $10.24 per share, representing the per share price equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the trust account not previously released to pay taxes or dissolution expenses, divided by the number of then outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock. In connection with the PHPC Redemption:\n$353.4 of funds held in the trust account immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption were distributed to redeem all of the outstanding shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock, which reduced Investments held in trust on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to zero as of September 30, 2023. The Company received $40.9 from the PHPC Redemption related to its ownership of 4.0 million shares of PHPC Series A Common Stock; and\nredeemable NCI of $312.5 immediately prior to the PHPC Redemption was reduced to zero on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023.\nSubsequent to the PHPC Redemption, PHPC delisted from the NYSE and dissolved in June 2023, and all classes of shares of PHPC equity were cancelled, including the PHPC Private Placement Units and the shares of the PHPC Series F Common Stock, which were surrendered by PHPC Sponsor for no consideration. PHPC Sponsor subsequently dissolved in August 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of changes in the Companys redeemable NCI on the Companys equity. The year ended September 30, 2021 represents the period that began May 28, 2021, the effective date of the PHPC IPO, and ended September 30, 2021.

(8th Avenue) that is accounted for using the equity method. In determining the accounting treatment of the common equity interest, management concluded that 8th Avenue was not a VIE as defined by ASC Topic 810, and as such, 8th Avenue was evaluated under the voting interest model. Based on the terms of 8th Avenues governing documents, management determined that the Company does not have a controlling voting interest in 8th Avenue due to substantive participating rights held by third parties associated\nwith the governance of 8th Avenue. However, the Company does retain significant influence, and therefore, the use of the equity method of accounting is required.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, 8th Avenues equity method loss attributable to Post exceeded the Companys remaining investment in 8th Avenue. In accordance with ASC Topic 323, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures, the Company did not recognize equity method losses in excess of its remaining investment in 8th Avenue, which was $66.6 as of September 30, 2021, and discontinued applying the equity method to the investment. As such, the Companys investment in 8th Avenue was zero at both September 30, 2023 and 2022, and there was no equity method gain (loss) attributable to 8th Avenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2023. The following table presents the calculation of the Companys equity method loss attributable to 8th Avenue for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNet loss attributable to 8th Avenue common shareholders $ (60.6)\n60.5 %\nEquity method loss attributable to Post $ (36.7)\nLess: Amortization of basis difference, net of tax (a) 6.8\nEquity method loss, net of tax $ (43.5)\n(a)The Company adjusted the historical basis of 8th Avenues assets and liabilities to fair value and recognized a basis difference of $70.3 upon the initial recording of its equity method investment in 8th Avenue. The basis difference related to property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets was initially amortized over the weighted-average useful lives of the assets. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the carrying value of the Companys investment in 8th Avenue was reduced to zero, resulting in the termination of basis difference amortization in accordance with ASC Topic 323.\nThe following table presents summarized financial information of 8th Avenue prior to the discontinuance of applying the equity method to the investment.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2022 2021\nNet sales $ 1,089.0 $ 900.8\nGross profit $ 159.9 $ 132.3\nNet loss $ (210.9) $ (24.3)\nLess: Preferred stock dividend 40.4 36.3\nNet loss attributable to 8th Avenue common shareholders $ (251.3) $ (60.6)\nThe Company provides services to 8th Avenue under a master services agreement (the MSA), as well as certain advisory services for a fee.

See Note 16 for additional information regarding the Second Debt-for-Equity Exchange. The Company had no ownership of BellRing Common Stock as of September 30, 2023.\nThe Company recognized a gain on its Investment in BellRing of $5.1 and $437.1 during the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was recorded in Gain on investment in BellRing in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No deferred income taxes have been recorded with respect to the non-cash mark-to-market adjustments on the Companys Investment in BellRing as of September 30, 2023 or 2022, as the Company fully divested its Investment in BellRing within 12 months of the BellRing Spin-off in a manner intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nWeetabix East Africa and Alpen\nThe Company holds a controlling equity interest in Weetabix East Africa Limited (Weetabix East Africa). Weetabix East Africa is a Kenyan-based company that produces RTE cereal and muesli. The Company owns 50.1% of Weetabix East Africa and holds a controlling voting and financial interest through its appointment of management and representation on Weetabix East Africas board of directors.

There were no held for sale gains or losses recorded in the year ended September 30, 2023.\nNOTE 8 - GOODWILL\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are presented in the following table.\nPost Consumer Brands Weetabix Foodservice Refrigerated Retail Total\nBalance, September 30, 2021\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,067.1 $ 929.4 $ 1,355.0 $ 807.9 $ 5,159.4\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (48.7) (657.8)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,458.0 $ 929.4 $ 1,355.0 $ 759.2 $ 4,501.6\nGoodwill from acquisitions (a) - 13.9 0.3 - 14.2\nSale of business (b) - - - (4.2) (4.2)\nCurrency translation adjustment (0.3) (161.7) - - (162.0)\nBalance, September 30, 2022\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,066.8 $ 781.6 $ 1,355.3 $ 803.7 $ 5,007.4\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (48.7) (657.8)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,457.7 $ 781.6 $ 1,355.3 $ 755.0 $ 4,349.6\nGoodwill from acquisition 194.2 - - - 194.2\nImpairment loss - - - (42.2) (42.2)\nCurrency translation adjustment 0.1 72.7 - - 72.8\nBalance, September 30, 2023\nGoodwill (gross) $ 2,261.1 $ 854.3 $ 1,355.3 $ 803.7 $ 5,274.4\nAccumulated impairment losses (609.1) - - (90.9) (700.0)\nGoodwill (net) $ 1,652.0 $ 854.3 $ 1,355.3 $ 712.8 $ 4,574.4\n(a)In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded $13.9 of goodwill related to the Lacka Foods acquisition and also recorded a final measurement period adjustment of $0.3 related to the Almark acquisition. For additional information on the Companys acquisitions, see Note 6.\n(b)In December 2021, the Company completed the WEF Transaction. For additional information on the WEF Transaction, see Note 7.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $42.2 related to its Cheese and Dairy reporting unit within the Refrigerated Retail segment, which was recorded in Impairment of goodwill in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The goodwill impairment charge was driven primarily by narrowing of the pricing gap between branded and private label competitors, resulting in distribution losses and declining profitability. See Note 14 for additional information on the significant assumptions utilized in the estimate of the fair value of the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit. The Company did not record a goodwill impairment charge during the years ended September 30, 2022 or 2021, as all reporting units subjected to the quantitative test passed during each respective year.\nAt September 30, 2023, the Weetabix reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 6.4% and was impacted by raw material and energy cost inflation as well as U.K. economic pressures negatively impacting consumer spending trends, both of which impacted near-term profitability. The Company expects these impacts to be transitory in nature; however, inherent risk to the reporting units cash flows remains. Variances between the actual performance of the reporting unit and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimate of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods. The estimated fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 13% at September 30, 2023.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Cheese and Dairy reporting unit and the Refrigerated Retail reporting unit fair values exceeded their carrying values by approximately 6.5% and 8.5%, respectively, and the estimated fair values of all other reporting units exceeded their carrying values by at least 10%. At September 30, 2021, the estimated fair values of all reporting units exceeded\ntheir carrying values by at least 11% (the lowest of which was Foodservice; all others exceeded their carrying values by at least 15%).\nNOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES\nThe components of Earnings before Income Taxes and Equity Method Loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and other summary information is presented in the following table.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nDomestic $ 397.2 $ 799.9 $ 105.9\nForeign 15.7 95.4 108.1\nEarnings before Income Taxes and Equity Method Loss $ 412.9 $ 895.3 $ 214.0\nIncome tax expense $ 99.7 $ 85.7 $ 58.2\nEffective income tax rate 24.1 % 9.6 % 27.2 %\nIncome tax expense consisted of the following:\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nCurrent:\nFederal $ 96.4 $ 71.1 $ (20.3)\nState 21.0 11.1 (0.2)\nForeign 5.2 13.2 10.5\n122.6 95.4 (10.0)\nDeferred:\nFederal (10.7) (9.7) 22.6\nState (11.8) - 3.4\nForeign (0.4) - 42.2\n(22.9) (9.7) 68.2\nIncome tax expense $ 99.7 $ 85.7 $ 58.2\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of income tax expense with amounts computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nComputed tax at federal statutory rate (21%)\n$ 86.7 $ 188.0 $ 44.9\nState income tax, net of effect on federal tax 12.2 10.3 1.7\nNon-deductible goodwill impairment charge\n8.9 - -\nNon-deductible compensation 7.0 5.9 5.4\nValuation allowances\n1.0 1.4 2.9\nEnacted tax law and changes in deferred tax rates (5.8) 0.9 40.0\nExcess tax benefits for share-based payments (5.7) (3.6) (6.1)\nIncome tax credits (2.4) (1.9) (1.5)\nEnhanced deduction for food donations (1.6) (1.0) (0.8)\nGain on investment in BellRing (a) (1.1) (91.8) -\nRate differential on foreign income (0.2) (10.2) (11.0)\nReturn-to-provision and changes in prior year accruals (0.1) (0.5) (2.8)\nNet losses and basis difference attributable to equity method investment - (14.1) (9.2)\nGain on bargain purchase - - (2.4)\nOther, net (none in excess of 5% of statutory tax)\n0.8 2.3 (2.9)\nIncome tax expense $ 99.7 $ 85.7 $ 58.2\n(a)No income taxes have been recorded with respect to the non-cash realized and unrealized book gains on the Companys Investment in BellRing during the years ended September 30, 2023 or 2022, as the Company fully divested its Investment in BellRing within 12 months of the BellRing Spin-off in a manner intended to qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Non-current deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nAssets Liabilities Net Assets Liabilities Net\nDisallowed interest carryforwards $ 53.9 $ - $ 53.9 $ 55.4 $ - $ 55.4\nLease liabilities 49.1 - 49.1 35.8 - 35.8\nDerivatives, equity securities and investment adjustments\n41.0 - 41.0 34.9 - 34.9\nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards 20.9 - 20.9 24.1 - 24.1\nStock-based and deferred compensation 20.6 - 20.6 19.9 - 19.9\nInventory\n16.0 - 16.0 8.8 - 8.8\nCapitalized research and development\n11.2 - 11.2 - - -\nAccrued liabilities 10.8 - 10.8 7.0 - 7.0\nAccrued vacation, incentive and severance 10.3 - 10.3 6.2 - 6.2\nBasis difference attributable to equity method investment 4.7 - 4.7 4.6 - 4.6\nIntangible assets - (592.2) (592.2) - (611.4) (611.4)\nProperty - (226.1) (226.1) - (197.6) (197.6)\nROU assets - (46.2) (46.2) - (32.9) (32.9)\nPension and other postretirement benefits - (16.2) (16.2) - (11.4) (11.4)\nOther items 6.9 (2.7) 4.2 5.5 (1.8) 3.7\nTotal gross deferred income taxes 245.4 (883.4) (638.0) 202.2 (855.1) (652.9)\nValuation allowance (36.4) - (36.4) (35.5) - (35.5)\nTotal deferred income taxes\n$ 209.0 $ (883.4) $ (674.4) $ 166.7 $ (855.1) $ (688.4)\nAs of September 30, 2023, the Companys $20.9 deferred tax asset for net operating loss (NOL) and credit carryforwards is comprised of state NOLs of $11.5, foreign tax loss carryforwards of $5.1, state credit carryforwards of $2.6 and U.S. federal NOL carryforwards of $1.7. The expiration for the majority of these carryforwards are either greater than 10 years or are able to be carried forward indefinitely. The Company has offset approximately $11.4 of the $11.5 state NOLs and all of the $5.1 of foreign tax loss carryforwards by a valuation allowance based on managements judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of those deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. In addition, as of September 30, 2023, the Company had a deferred tax asset for disallowed U.S. interest expense of $53.9 subject to Internal Revenue Code Section 163(j) limitations, which may be carried forward indefinitely. Based on managements judgement, with the exception of a $6.0 valuation allowance recorded for state-related disallowed interest carryforwards, it is more likely than not that the Company will recognize the benefit of this deferred tax asset in the future.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a valuation allowance of $36.4 and $35.5, respectively, based on managements judgment that it is more likely than not that the benefits of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The changes in the valuation allowance during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 were $0.9, $(6.1) and $0.5, respectively. These changes primarily relate to valuation allowances on state carryforwards.\nThe Company generally repatriates a portion of current year earnings from select non-U.S. subsidiaries only if the economic cost of the repatriation is not considered material. No provision has been made for income taxes on the Companys undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries of $106.2 as of September 30, 2023, as it is the Companys intention to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to, amongst other things, fund local operations, fund debt service payments, fund pension and other post-retirement obligations, fund capital projects and support foreign growth initiatives, including potential acquisitions. If the Company repatriated any of the earnings, it could be subject to withholding tax and the impact of foreign currency movements. It is not practicable to estimate the additional income taxes and applicable foreign withholding taxes that would be payable on the remittance of such undistributed earnings. Applicable income and withholding taxes will be provided on these earnings in the periods in which they are no longer considered reinvested.\nU.K. Tax Law Changes\nIn fiscal 2021, the effective income tax rate was impacted by enacted tax law changes in the U.K., which included a provision to increase the U.K.s corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. During the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company measured its existing deferred tax assets and liabilities considering the 25%\nU.K. corporate income tax rate for future periods and recorded tax expense of $0.7, $0.9 and $40.0, respectively. Other changes made to the U.K.s tax laws did not have a material impact on the Companys financial statements during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To the extent the Companys assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate will be recorded in the period in which the determination is made.\nUnrecognized tax benefits activity is presented in the following table.\nAs of and for the Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nBalance, beginning of year $ 11.7 $ 12.5 $ 8.3\nAdditions for tax positions taken in current year and acquisitions 0.8 0.1 0.3\nAdditions for tax positions taken in prior years 0.4 - 5.2\nSettlements with tax authorities/statute expirations (0.1) (0.9) (1.3)\nBalance, end of year $ 12.8 $ 11.7 $ 12.5\nThe amount of the net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would directly affect the effective income tax rate was $7.6 at September 30, 2023. The Company believes that, due to expiring statutes of limitations and settlements with tax authorities, it is reasonably possible that the total unrecognized tax benefits may decrease up to approximately $5.3 within twelve months of the reporting date.\nThe Company computes tax-related interest and penalties as the difference between the tax position recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amount previously taken on the Companys tax returns and classifies these amounts as components of income tax expense (benefit). The Company recorded income tax expense (benefit) of $0.5, $0.1 and $(0.5) related to interest and penalties in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $1.1 and $0.6 at September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The accrued interest and penalties are not included in the table above.\nU.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign jurisdiction income tax returns for the tax years ended September 30, 2020 through September 30, 2022 are generally open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in each respective jurisdiction.\nNOTE 10 -

The Company also paid $2.1 in connection with the termination of $332.6 notional value of its interest rate swap option, and received cash proceeds of $6.7 in connection with the termination of its interest rate swap contract with a $200.0 notional value.\nIn fiscal 2022, the Company paid $17.0 in connection with the termination of $700.0 notional value of its rate-lock swap contracts. The Company also restructured two of its rate-lock swap contracts, which contained other-than-insignificant financing elements. There were no cash settlements paid or received in connection with these restructurings.\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company restructured four of its rate-lock swap contracts, which contained non-cash, off-market financing elements. There were no cash settlements paid or received in connection with these restructurings.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of derivative instruments held.\nSeptember 30,\n2023 2022\nCommodity contracts $ 215.0 $ 145.0\nEnergy contracts 48.9 23.7\nFX contracts\n3.0 3.2\nInterest rate swap 700.0 200.0\nInterest rate swaps - Rate-lock swaps - 849.3\nInterest rate swaps - Option\n- 332.6\nPHPC Warrants - 16.9\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location and fair value of the Companys derivative instruments.

These amounts were classified as Restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNOTE 14 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table presents the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement according to the levels in the fair value hierarchy in ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement.\nSeptember 30, 2023 September 30, 2022\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Total Level 1 Level 2\nAssets:\nDeferred compensation investments $ 13.0 $ 13.0 $ - $ 12.0 $ 12.0 $ -\nDerivative assets 25.6 - 25.6 32.9 - 32.9\nEquity securities 0.2 0.2 - 32.1 32.1 -\nInvestment in BellRing - - - 94.8 94.8 -\n$ 38.8 $ 13.2 $ 25.6 $ 171.8 $ 138.9 $ 32.9\nLiabilities:\nDeferred compensation liabilities $ 36.8 $ - $ 36.8 $ 33.7 $ - $ 33.7\nDerivative liabilities 16.1 - 16.1 75.0 1.0 74.0\n$ 52.9 $ - $ 52.9 $ 108.7 $ 1.0 $ 107.7\nDeferred Compensation\nThe deferred compensation investments are primarily invested in mutual funds, and their fair value is measured using the market approach. These investments are in the same funds, or funds that employ a similar investment strategy, and are purchased in substantially the same amounts, as the participants selected notional investment options (excluding Post common stock equivalents), which represent the underlying liabilities to participants in the Companys deferred compensation plans. Deferred compensation liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants in cash, based on the fair value of participants selected notional investment options (excluding certain Post common stock equivalents to be distributed in shares) using the market approach.\nDerivatives\nThe Company utilizes the income approach to measure fair value for its commodity and energy derivatives. The income approach uses pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves and forward prices. FX contracts are valued using the spot rate less the forward rate multiplied by the notional amount. The Companys calculation of the fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. Refer to Note 13 for the classification of changes in fair value of derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the PHPC Warrants were valued using the market approach based on quoted prices and were categorized as Level 1. The fair value of the PHPC Warrants was zero as of September 30, 2023, as the PHPC Warrants expired worthless in connection with the PHPC Redemption. For additional information on the PHPC Warrants, see Notes 5 and 13.\nEquity Securities and Investment in BellRing\nThe Company uses the market approach to measure the fair value of its equity securities. The Investment in BellRing represented the Companys 3.4% equity interest in BellRing as of September 30, 2022, which was measured at its fair value of $94.8 based on the trading value of the BellRing Common Stock on September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2023, the Company did not hold an equity interest in BellRing. For additional information on the Investment in BellRing, see Notes 4 and 5.\nOther Fair Value Measurements\nInvestments held in trust held prior to the PHPC Redemption were invested in a fund consisting entirely of U.S. treasury securities. The fund was valued at net asset value (NAV) per share, and as such, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, the investments were not classified in the fair value hierarchy.

In addition to the foregoing, under the terms of the Fourth Joinder Agreement, so long as any principal or accrued interest remains outstanding with respect to the Fourth Incremental Term Loan, the Company is required to comply with financial covenants consisting of the foregoing secured net leverage ratio as of the last day of each\nfiscal quarter and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 2.00 to 1.00 measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. As of September 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants.\nThe Credit Agreement provides for incremental revolving and term loan facilities, and also permits other secured or unsecured debt, if, among other conditions, certain financial ratios are met, as defined and specified in the Credit Agreement.\nNOTE 17 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Proceedings\nAntitrust Claims\nIn late 2008 and early 2009, approximately 22 class action lawsuits were filed in various federal courts against Michael Foods, Inc. (MFI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and approximately 20 other defendants (producers of shell eggs and egg products and egg industry organizations), alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws in connection with the production and sale of shell eggs and egg products, and seeking unspecified damages. All cases were transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and/or consolidated pretrial proceedings.\nThe cases involved three plaintiff groups: (i) a nationwide class of direct purchasers of shell eggs (the direct purchaser class); (ii) individual companies (primarily large grocery chains and food companies that purchase considerable quantities of eggs) that opted out of various settlements and filed their own complaints related to their purchases of shell eggs and egg products (the opt-out plaintiffs); and (iii) indirect purchasers of shell eggs (the indirect purchaser plaintiffs).\nResolution of this matter: (i) In December 2016, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by the direct purchaser class for a payment of $75.0, which was approved by the district court in December 2017; (ii) in January 2017, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by opt-out plaintiffs related to shell egg purchases on confidential terms; (iii) in June 2018, MFI settled all claims asserted against it by indirect purchaser plaintiffs on confidential terms; (iv) between June 2019 and September 2019, MFI individually settled on confidential terms egg product opt-out claims asserted against it by four separate opt-out plaintiffs; and (v) in September 2022, MFI settled the remaining pending claims for this matter, which had sought damages based on purchases of egg products by three opt-out plaintiffs, on confidential terms.\nMFI has at all times denied liability in this matter, and no settlement contains any admission of liability by MFI. During the year ended September 30, 2022, the Company expensed $13.8 related to the September 2022 settlement, which was included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No expense was recorded in the years ended September 30, 2023 or 2021 related to these matters and the Company had no accruals related to these matters as of September 30, 2023 or 2022. Under current law, any settlement paid, including the settlements with the direct purchaser plaintiffs, the opt-out plaintiffs and the indirect purchaser plaintiffs, is deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOther\nThe Company is subject to various other legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, based upon the information presently known, the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such pending legal proceedings, as well as from asserted legal claims and known potential legal claims which are likely to be asserted, taking into account established accruals for estimated liabilities (if any), are not expected to be material individually or in the aggregate to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. In addition, although it is difficult to estimate the potential financial impact of actions regarding expenditures for compliance with regulatory matters, in the opinion of management, based upon the information currently available, the ultimate liability arising from such compliance matters is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nBob Evans Lease Guarantees\nHistorically, Bob Evans Farms, Inc. (Bob Evans) guaranteed certain payment and performance obligations associated with the leases for 143 properties (the Guarantees) leased by the restaurant business formerly owned by Bob Evans (the Bob Evans Restaurant Business). The Guarantees remained in effect following the Companys acquisition of Bob Evans in 2018, but have subsequently been adjusted to apply only to 130 properties. In the event the Bob Evans Restaurant Business fails to meet its payment and performance obligations under these leases, subject in certain cases to certain early termination allowances, the Company may be required to make rent and other payments to the landlord under the requirements of the Guarantees. Should the Company, as guarantor of the lease obligations, be required to make all lease payments due for the remaining terms of the leases subsequent to September 30, 2023, the maximum amount the Company may be required to pay is equal to the annual rent amount for the remainder of the lease terms. The current annual rent on these leases is $13.1 and will increase up to 1.5% annually based on indexed inflation. The lease terms for the majority of the leases extend for approximately 14 years from September 30, 2023, and the Guarantees would remain in effect in the event the leases are extended for a renewal\nperiod. In the event the Company is obligated to make payments under any of the Guarantees, the Company believes its exposure is limited due to protections and recourse available in the leases associated with the leased properties, including a requirement of the applicable landlord to mitigate damages by re-letting the properties in default. While the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the restaurants industry generally, including the Bob Evans Restaurant Business, the Bob Evans Restaurant Business was able to amend certain of its leases during fiscal 2020 in order to ensure that it continued to meet its obligations under these leases, and there is no indication that the obligations will not continue to be met. As such, the Company believes the fair value of the Guarantees is immaterial as of September 30, 2023.\nNOTE 18 - PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company maintains qualified defined benefit plans in the U.S., the U.K. and Canada for certain employees primarily within its Post Consumer Brands and Weetabix segments. Certain of the Companys employees are eligible to participate in the Companys postretirement benefit plans (partially subsidized retiree health and life insurance). The following disclosures reflect amounts related to the Companys employees based on separate actuarial valuations, projections and certain allocations. Amounts for the Canadian plans are included in the North America disclosures and are not disclosed separately because they do not constitute a significant portion of the combined amounts. With respect to defined benefits for Canadian Post Consumer Brands employees, eligibility is frozen to new entrants and benefit accrual is frozen for salaried employees. With respect to defined benefits for U.S. Post Consumer Brands employees, eligibility is frozen to new employees and the benefit accrual is frozen for all administrative employees and certain production employees. The benefit accrual is frozen for salaried Weetabix North America employees in the U.S. With respect to Weetabix employees in the U.K. participating in the executive and group schemes of the defined benefit pension plans, the plans are closed to new entrants and the benefit accrual is frozen with respect to existing participants.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the pension plans benefit obligations and fair value of assets over the two year period ended September 30, 2023 and a statement of the funded status and amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nNorth America Other International\nAs of and for the Year Ended September 30, As of and for the Year Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2023 2022\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year $ 95.5 $ 133.3 $ 421.1 $ 821.3\nService cost 2.2 4.3 - -\nInterest cost 5.3 3.5 23.3 15.7\nPlan participants contributions 0.3 0.4 - -\nNet actuarial gain\n(5.4) (38.9) (37.5) (251.6)\nBenefits paid (5.4) (5.9) (25.9) (28.4)\nCurrency translation 0.1 (1.2) 41.0 (135.9)\nBenefit obligation at end of year $ 92.6 $ 95.5 $ 422.0 $ 421.1\nChange in fair value of plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year $ 102.9 $ 136.6 $ 507.3 $ 970.9\nActual return on plan assets 10.1 (27.1) (14.3) (273.0)\nEmployer contributions 0.1 0.4 - -\nPlan participants contributions 0.3 0.4 - -\nBenefits paid (5.4) (5.9) (25.9) (28.4)\nCurrency translation 0.2 (1.5) 49.4 (162.1)\nOther - - (0.1) (0.1)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year 108.2 102.9 516.4 507.3\nFunded status $ 15.6 $ 7.4 $ 94.4 $ 86.2\nAmounts recognized in assets or liabilities\nOther assets $ 15.9 $ 7.7 $ 94.4 $ 86.2\nOther liabilities (0.3) (0.3) - -\nNet amount recognized $ 15.6 $ 7.4 $ 94.4 $ 86.2\nAmounts recognized in accumulated OCI\nNet actuarial (gain) loss\n$ (2.7) $ 5.0 $ 47.7 $ 40.2\nPrior service cost 0.4 0.6 10.3 10.7\nTotal $ (2.3) $ 5.6 $ 58.0 $ 50.9\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligation\nDiscount rate - U.S. plans 6.06 % 5.65 % n/a n/a\nDiscount rate - Canadian plans 5.68 % 5.12 % n/a n/a\nDiscount rate - Other international plans n/a n/a 5.67 % 5.15 %\nRate of compensation increase - U.S. plans 3.00 % 3.00 % n/a n/a\nRate of compensation increase - Canadian plans 2.75 % 2.75 % n/a n/a\nRate of compensation increase - Other international plans n/a n/a 3.02 % 3.85 %\nThe fair value of plan assets for the North America and Other International pension plans exceeded the accumulated benefit obligation at September 30, 2023 and 2022.

The broad target allocations are 57.7% equity securities, 38.0% fixed income and bonds, 3.3% real assets and 1.0% cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2023, equity securities were 64.7%, fixed income and bonds were 30.2%, real assets were 1.3% and cash and cash equivalents were 3.8% of the fair value of total plan assets, 96.8% of which was invested in passive index funds. At September 30, 2022, equity securities were 54.5%, fixed income and bonds were 33.9%, real assets were 2.9% and cash and cash equivalents were 8.7% of the fair value of total plan assets, 91.9% of which was invested in passive index funds. The allocation guidelines were established based on managements determination of the appropriate risk posture and long-term objectives.\nThe expected return on Other International pension plan assets was determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various asset classes, using the target allocation. The broad target allocations are 71.6% fixed income and bonds, 27.7% liability driven investments, 0.6% real assets and 0.1% cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2023, fixed income and bonds were 75.2%, liability driven investments were 21.4% and cash and cash equivalents were 3.4% of the fair value of total plan assets, 23.7% of which was invested in passive index funds. At September 30, 2022, fixed income and bonds were 78.8%, liability driven investments were 18.7%, real assets were 0.4% and cash and cash equivalents were 2.1% of the fair value of total plan assets, 20.2% of which was invested in passive index funds. The allocation guidelines were established by the trustees of the plan based on their determination of the appropriate risk posture and long-term objectives after consulting with management.\nThe following tables present the North America and Other International pension plans assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis and the basis for that measurement.

On January 27, 2022, the Companys shareholders approved the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan), which permits the issuance of stock-based compensation awards of up to 2.4 million shares, plus shares remaining to be issued under the 2019 Long-Term Incentive Plan (including any shares assumed thereunder from the 2016 and 2012 Long-Term Incentive\nPlans) which were transferred to the 2021 Plan upon its effectiveness as well as shares underlying awards previously issued under any of the Long-Term Incentive Plans which awards are later forfeited. Awards issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plans have a maximum term of 10 years.\nTotal compensation cost for the Companys cash and non-cash stock-based compensation awards recognized in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $77.8, $66.4 and $49.7, respectively, and the related recognized deferred tax benefit for each of those periods was approximately $10.5, $9.1 and $5.8, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the total compensation cost related to Posts non-vested awards not yet recognized was $77.2, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.\nBellRing Spin-off\nIn connection with the BellRing Spin-off, adjustments were made to the terms of outstanding equity-based awards (the Equity Awards) to preserve the intrinsic value of the Equity Awards and to participants accounts under the deferred compensation plans maintained by the Company with respect to notional investments in Post common stock (the Deferred Compensation Accounts). The adjustments to the Equity Awards and Deferred Compensation Accounts were based on the volume weighted average price of a share of Post common stock during the five trading day period prior to and including March 10, 2022 and the volume weighted average price of a share of Post common stock during the five trading day period immediately following March 10, 2022.\nThe adjustments to the Equity Awards and Deferred Compensation Accounts had an immaterial impact on the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.\nStock Appreciation Rights (SARs)\n$ in millions, except price per share\nSARs Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Per Share\nWeighted-\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm in Years Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 81,554 $ 33.42\nGranted -\nExercised (29,656) 28.28\nForfeited -\nExpired -\nOutstanding at September 30, 2023 51,898 36.35 1.23 $ 2.6\nVested and expected to vest as of September 30, 2023 51,898 36.35 1.23 2.6\nExercisable at September 30, 2023 51,898 36.35 1.23 2.6\nUpon exercise of each SAR, the holder will receive the number of shares of Post common stock equal in value to the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value at the date of exercise, less all applicable taxes. The total intrinsic value of SARs exercised was $1.9, $3.0 and $3.2 during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company used the simplified method for estimating a stock option term as it did not have sufficient historical stock option exercise experience\nupon which to estimate an expected term. The expected term was estimated based on the awards vesting period and contractual term. Expected volatilities were based on historical volatility trends and other factors. The risk-free rate was the interpolated U.S. Treasury rate for a term equal to the expected term. There were no stock options granted during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 or 2021.\nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $14.1, $14.1 and $46.4 in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company received proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $3.9, $4.9 and $7.6 during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 1,348,806 $ 68.38\nGranted 526,035 90.85\nVested (763,124) 67.34\nForfeited (51,485) 74.06\nNonvested at September 30, 2023 1,060,232 79.99\nThe grant date fair value of each RSU award was determined based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested RSUs was $79.99, $68.38 and $97.23 at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total vest date fair value of RSUs that vested during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $68.9, $35.1 and $49.8, respectively.\nCash-Settled Restricted Stock Units (Cash RSUs)\nCash RSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 29,063 $ 34.68\nGranted - -\nVested (16,015) 34.68\nForfeited - -\nNonvested at September 30, 2023 13,048 34.68\nAt September 30, 2023, the 13,048 nonvested Cash RSUs were valued at the greater of the Companys closing stock price or the grant price of $34.68. Cash used by the Company to settle Cash RSUs was $1.4, $1.1 and $1.1 for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nEarnings-Based Performance Restricted Stock Units (Earnings PRSUs)\nEarnings PRSUs Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date Fair Value Per Share\nNonvested at September 30, 2022 272,427 $ 70.46\nGranted 142,939 94.09\nVested (148,531) 70.36\nForfeited (7,293) 83.83\nNonvested at September 30, 2023 259,542 83.20\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted Earnings PRSUs to certain employees. These awards will be earned based on reaching certain earnings-based targets over a period ranging from one to three years. The grant date fair value of each Earnings PRSU award was determined based upon the closing price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant and the assumption that the Company would meet the full earnings-based targets. The Company reassesses the probability of achieving the earnings-based targets each quarterly reporting period and adjusts compensation cost accordingly. The weighted-average grant date fair value of nonvested Earnings PRSUs was $83.20, $70.46 and $98.33 at September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total vest date fair value of Earnings PRSUs that vested during the year ended September 30, 2023 was $14.1.

No Market PRSUs vested during the year ended September 30, 2023.\nDuring the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, the Company granted Market PRSUs to certain employees, which will be earned by comparing Posts total shareholder return (TSR) during a three year period to the respective TSRs of companies in a performance peer group. Based upon Posts ranking in its performance peer group when comparing TSRs, a recipient of a Market PRSU grant may earn a total award ranging from 0% to 260% of the target award. The fair value of each Market PRSU was estimated on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation. The weighted-average assumptions for Market PRSUs granted during the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are summarized in the table below.\n2023 2022 2021\nExpected term (in years) 3.0 3.0 3.0\nExpected stock price volatility 29.1% 27.7% 28.3%\nRisk-free interest rate 4.1% 0.9% 0.2%\nExpected dividends 0% 0% 0%\nFair value (per Market PRSU) $156.05 $163.63 $152.58\nDeferred Compensation\nPost provides deferred compensation plans for directors and key employees through which eligible participants may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of their compensation, and, with respect to key employee participants, all or a portion of their eligible annual bonus, until a later date based on the participants elections. Participant deferrals for employee and director participants may be notionally invested in Post common stock equivalents (the Equity Option) or into a number of funds operated by The Vanguard Group Inc. with a variety of investment strategies and objectives (the Vanguard Funds). In order to receive a 33.3% matching contribution, deferrals for director participants must be made into the Equity Option. Deferrals into the Equity Option are generally distributed in Post common stock for employees and cash for directors, while deferrals into the Vanguard Funds are distributed in cash. There are no significant costs related to the administration of the deferred compensation plans. Post funds its deferred compensation liability (potential cash distributions) by investing in the Vanguard Funds in substantially the same amounts as selected by the participating employees. Both realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and offset the related change in the deferred compensation liability. For additional information regarding deferred compensation, see Note 14.\nNOTE 20 - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nThe following table summarizes the Companys repurchases of its common stock.\nYear Ended September 30,\n2023 2022 2021\nShares repurchased (in millions)\n4.4 4.9 4.0\nAverage price per share (a)\n$ 87.13 $ 90.02 $ 98.37\nTotal share repurchase costs (b)\n$ 387.1 $ 439.0 $ 393.7\n(a)Average price per share excludes brokers commissions, which are included in Total share repurchase costs within this table. Average price per share during the year ended September 30, 2022 was $103.79 prior to the BellRing Spin-off and $81.53 subsequent to the BellRing Spin-off.\n(b)Purchases of treasury stock in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2022 included $4.0 of repurchases of common stock that were accrued in fiscal 2021 but did not settle until fiscal 2022. Purchases of treasury stock in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2021 included $7.4 of repurchases of common stock that were accrued in fiscal 2020 but did not settle until fiscal 2021.\nOn April 28, 2023, the Company completed the Pet Food acquisition (see Note 6). The purchase price included the issuance of 5.4 million shares of Post common stock to Smucker. The shares of Post common stock were valued based on the price of Posts common stock for total stock consideration of $492.3. The Company did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of the shares of Post common stock to Smucker.\nThe Company may, from time to time, enter into common stock structured repurchase arrangements with financial institutions using general corporate funds. Under such arrangements, the Company pays a fixed sum of cash upon execution of each agreement in exchange for the right to receive either a predetermined amount of cash or Post common stock. Upon expiration of each agreement, if the closing market price of Posts common stock is above the predetermined price, the Company will have the initial investment returned with a premium in cash. If the closing market price of Posts common stock is at or below the predetermined price, the Company will receive the number of shares specified in the agreement. The Company settled a structured share repurchase arrangement during the year ended September 30, 2021 and received cash payments of $47.5, which were recorded as Cash received from share repurchase contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nNOTE 21 - SEGMENTS\nAt September 30, 2023, the Company managed and reported operating results through the following four reportable segments:\nPost Consumer Brands: North American RTE cereal, pet food and nut butters;\nWeetabix: primarily U.K. RTE cereal, muesli and protein-based shakes;\nFoodservice: primarily egg and potato products; and\nRefrigerated Retail: primarily side dish, egg, cheese and sausage products.\nDue to the level of integration between the Foodservice and Refrigerated Retail segments, it is impracticable to present additions to property and intangibles and total assets separately for each segment. An allocation has been made between the two segments for depreciation based on inventory costing.\nAmounts reported for Corporate in the table below include any amounts attributable to PHPC prior to the PHPC Redemption (see Note 5).\nManagement evaluates each segments performance based on its segment profit, which for all segments is its earnings/loss before income taxes and equity method earnings/loss before impairment of property, goodwill and other intangible assets, facility closure related costs, restructuring expenses, gain/loss on assets and liabilities held for sale, gain/loss on sale of businesses and facilities, gain on/adjustment to bargain purchase, interest expense and other unallocated corporate income and expenses.\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, Posts revenues were primarily generated by sales within the U.S.; foreign sales were 11.0%, 12.5% and 14.3% of total net sales, respectively. The largest concentration of foreign sales was within the U.K., which accounted for 54.0%, 52.9% and 54.6% of total foreign sales in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales are attributed to individual countries based on the address to which the product is shipped.\nAs of September 30, 2023 and 2022, the majority of Posts tangible long-lived assets were located in the U.S.; the remainder were located primarily in the U.K. and Canada, which combined have a net carrying value of approximately $280.9 and $253.6, respectively.\nIn the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, one customer, including its affiliates, accounted for 17.3%, 14.4% and 15.9%, respectively, of Posts total net sales.
