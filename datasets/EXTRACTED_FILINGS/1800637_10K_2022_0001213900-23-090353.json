    "content": "Item 1. Business.\nUnless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, references in this report to Agrify, the Company, we, us, our, or similar references mean Agrify Corporation and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\nBusiness Overview\nWe are a leading provider of innovative cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis industry, bringing data, science, and technology to the forefront of the market. Our proprietary micro-environment-controlled Agrify Vertical Farming Units (or VFUs) enable cultivators to produce high quality products with what we believe to be unmatched consistency, yield, and return investment at scale. Our comprehensive extraction product line, which includes hydrocarbon, alcohol, solventless, post-processing, and lab equipment, empowers producers to maximize the quantity and quality of extract required for premium concentrates.\nSince our inception, we have gone from primarily developing, selling, and supporting our VFUs along with our fully integrated Agrify Insights\u2122 cultivation software (Agrify Insights\u2122) to being able to offer customers a far more complete set of solutions, products, and services across both cultivation and extraction. This has been a function of both our natural evolution and through a set of strategic mergers and acquisitions. Since 2020, we have integrated six new brands into Agrifys broader organization. Our first acquisition, TriGrow Systems, Inc., was completed in January 2020. TriGrow Systems, Inc. was formerly the exclusive distributor of Agrifys VFUs. We added Harbor Mountain Holdings, LLC to our portfolio on July 21, 2020, to help scale up our manufacturing strategy with engineering, prototyping, manufacturing, testing, warehousing, and installation services. Since October 2021, we have been strategically focused on establishing ourselves as a global leader in the cannabis and hemp extraction equipment industry, complementing our cutting-edge cannabis and hemp cultivation solutions. Over five months, we acquired four of the top brand names in the industry. On October 1, 2021, we acquired Precision Extraction Solutions, a market leader in developing and producing high-quality hydrocarbon and alcohol extraction solutions, and Cascade Sciences, LLC, a market leader in developing and producing high-quality vacuum purge ovens and decarboxylation ovens. On December 31, 2021, we acquired PurePressure, LLC, a market leader in developing and producing high-quality solventless extraction solutions and advanced ice-water hash processing equipment in the cannabis and hemp industry. Lastly, on February 1, 2022, we completed our acquisition of LS Holdings Corp., a market leader in developing and producing high-quality distillation and solvent separation solutions for the cannabis and hemp industry.\nWe now offer our customers an extensive ecosystem of solutions, products, training, and service capabilities in what has historically been a highly fragmented market. Our offerings, which are described in more detail below, are compelling on their own. However, we believe what sets us apart is our ability to bring to the market the most comprehensive set of cultivation and extraction solutions from a single provider. As a result, we believe we are well-positioned to capture market share and create a dominant market position in the indoor cannabis sector. We currently have two primary areas of business focus:\n\u25cf Cultivation Solutions; and\n\u25cf Extraction Solutions.\nCultivation Solutions\nWhile we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute, or dispense cannabis or any cannabis derivatives that are currently prohibited under U.S. federal law, our equipment and business solutions can be used within indoor grow facilities by fully licensed cannabis cultivators. We sell our proprietary cultivation solutions to independent licensed cultivators. The two primary products we sell are the VFUs and Agrify Insights\u2122. We believe we are one of a limited number of companies offering a fully integrated cultivation solution optimized for precision growing with robust automation capabilities in the industry.\nAgrify Vertical Farming Unit\nOur proprietary VFU technology offers a modular, compartmentalized micro-climate growing system for indoor vertical farming. Our VFU system is designed for craft farmers, single-state operators, and multi-state operators who are looking to consistently produce higher-quality crops at scale. The VFUs are designed to line up horizontally in rows, and can be stacked vertically up to three units tall, taking advantage of unused indoor vertical space with the below benefits:\n\u25cf Superior Floor Space Utilization. Each VFU provides two tiers of growing canopy. Our units introduce an open-room facility design approach to maximize available cultivation floor space while offering superior risk mitigation via individual compartmentalized cultivation chambers which aim to contain potential biological threats to cultivation facilities.\n\u25cf Precise Environmental Controls. Each VFU has an Environmental Control Unit that is integrated with our proprietary cultivation software, Agrify Insights\u2122. This integration allows for precise control and automation over light photoperiod and intensity, temperature, humidity, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), carbon dioxide, fertigation, and irrigation throughout the lifecycle of the plants.\n\u25cf Modular Scalability. The VFU is designed to stack up to three units tall, sextupling production volume over the same traditional footprint. Each unit is designed to easily integrate with a mezzanine catwalk system providing unparalleled access to all levels of cultivation.\n\u25cf Worker Safety & Efficiency. The VFUs design was thoughtful and intentional; from the ergonomic dimensions that facilitate safe, easy access to plants for scouting and plant husbandry, to the integrated catwalks that allow cultivators to work from a safe sitting or standing position without the need for scissor lifts, ladders or removable platforms.\n\u25cf Biosecurity and Risk Mitigation. The VFU has a motorized curtain on both sides of the unit that encloses the grow area to prevent light pollution and the spread of disease that would typically lead to facility-wide crop failure. Contamination can be controlled and limited to the affected units, which are designed with sanitation in mind. From the aluminum frame to the selection of antimicrobial plastics and down to the IP65 electronics and polycarbonate-lensed LED lights, the entire VFU can be easily sanitized, especially with the VFUs High Heat mode, which helps sanitize all internal VFU surfaces effortlessly.\nAgrify Insights\u2122\nThe VFUs are designed to work in conjunction with our Agrify Insights\u2122 software. Each VFU sold includes a license for Agrify Insights\u2122 and a monthly Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) subscription fee is charged per VFU. The VFU cannot operate successfully without Agrify Insights\u2122, and we typically charge between $1,500 to $2,400 per VFU sold annually. Agrify Insights\u2122 license agreements are generally for a multi-year term, with an annual auto-renewal.\nAgrify Insights\u2122 is a SaaS-based solution that interfaces with our proprietary hardware to provide customers with real-time control and monitoring of facilities, growing conditions and insights into both production and profit optimization. The combination of precise environmental control and automation with data collection and actionable insights empowers our customers to be more efficient, more productive, and more intelligent about how they run their businesses. We believe that the robust data analytics capabilities from our Agrify Insights\u2122 platform, coupled with our VFU system, is enabling our customers to transform their businesses and quality of the product they are cultivating.\nAgrify Insights\u2122 is focused on optimizing four key components:\n\u25cf Optimization at the plant level;\n\u25cf Optimization at the VFU unit level;\n\u25cf Optimization at the facility level; and\n\u25cf Optimization at the business level.\nWhen these key components are combined, they encompass the cultivation operations of an Agrify customer. By reducing human error and providing insights through data collection and analysis, Agrify Insights\u2122 minimizes risk and increases operational efficiencies. Ultimately, our customers seek to produce end products with the highest level of consistency no matter where they are located.\nPlant-Level Optimization\nCentral to our solution is granular control of the cultivation environment. A crops end-product is determined by the plants genetics and the environment in which the plants are grown. Control over the growing environment is accomplished through the integration of Agrify Insights\u2122. Agrify Insights collects data from multiple sensors on a per plant basis between 4 and 60 times an hour. This can result in between 100 thousand and 151 million data points annually, depending on the number of plants and fluctuations in the VFU microclimate. By recording data points and reproducing specific environments based on the data, cultivators can effectively minimize the variation in their crops and dial-in the maximum quality. Individual plant varietals can be optimized by tailoring the grow plan (recipe for cultivation) to enhance genetic traits; increasing the temperature can speed chemical processes and growth rates and adjusting the length of different phases of a plants lifecycle can maximize the crops yield. Additionally, when new varieties of plants are cultivated, having multiple controlled, compartmentalized, growth chambers allow for iterative experiments which offer real insight into how new varieties are best cultivated which is beneficial for research and development purposes.\nOur Grow Plans are the templates or recipes that define the parameters for each lifecycle. Grow Plans define the environmental settings (light - photoperiod and intensity, temperature, humidity, VPD, CO2, irrigation, fertigation) for each crop variety and cultivator as well as the schedule for completing, as applicable, plant touching tasks such as bottoming, pruning, and harvesting. Agrify Insights\u2122 ships to the customer with many pre-developed Grow Plans and customers can create their own Grow Plans, electing to share them with other customers or not.\nIndividual VFU Level Optimization\nOur VFU hardware provides cultivation environmental control within the grow chamber. This hardware and its component valves, motors and sensors are directed and controlled by Agrify Insights\u2122.\n\u25cf Monitor and Control Agrify Hardware. Agrify Insights\u2122 can either automatically or manually control our hardware. For example, the water-chilled fan coil can keep the temperature in a range accurate to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\u25cf Cultivation Environmental Control. Using Agrify Insights\u2122, users can view environmental charts that plot temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide over time. It also shows when plant irrigation occurs and whether the unit is in cooling, circulating, or dehumidifying mode. We sample these values every minute and report them back to the cloud every 15 minutes or more often if significant changes occur. Each growing chamber reports millions of data points annually, enabling our clients to perform an in-depth analysis of their grow performance. The manual control screen visualizes the current state of the grow chamber and allows our technicians to take direct control for troubleshooting, if necessary. The device log shows us what decisions were made by Agrify Insights\u2122 and why.\nFacility Level Optimization\nOur modular VFUs are deployed in scale at a customers facility with the smallest commercial operation deployment being 60 VFUs to date. Agrify Insights\u2122 is designed to operate these individual VFUs as a combined facility. Agrify Insights\u2122 features at the facility level include:\n\u25cf Production Planning. The production planning feature is designed to maximize a facilitys utilization by executing a best-fit scheduling algorithm to selected Grow Plans across VFUs that have been deployed at a customer facility. Since grow plans typically have a different number of growing days that start on staggered schedules, this module is a critical component for optimizing the planting and moving schedules, significantly increasing plant production, and reducing the cost per pound of harvest.\n\u25cf Workforce Management. Agrify Insights\u2122 includes a workforce planning feature to assign tasks to staff. These tasks can be automatically assigned based on the user role or their knowledge, skills, and abilities. The calendar displays the estimated time required to complete plant-touching tasks on any given day.\n\u25cf Automatic Notification System. Users can select to subscribe to anomalous events, and users are notified in the order in which they are listed. If a user does not acknowledge the notification within the specified time frame, the next user in the list is notified, providing the business with 24/7 monitoring and notifications.\n\u25cf Preventative Maintenance. Our equipment and facility preventative maintenance schedules and related tasks are contained, tracked, and monitored within Agrify Insights\u2122.\n\u25cf Facility Infrastructure Controls. Agrify Insights\u2122 controls the irrigation on a facility level and connects with the water chilled HVAC system and ambient lighting system, providing our customers with a central piece of software for facility management.\nOptimization at the Business Level\nAgrify Insights\u2122 analysis features enable customers to understand how cultivation decisions impact their overall business. Understanding the data from the cultivation facility can help our customers better plan and make informed decisions that impact downstream parts of their business.\n\u25cf Consumables Procurement Integration. Each task can also be assigned a set of consumables whose inventory will be reduced when the task is started. This feature can help customers manage supply levels and can automatically create purchase orders so that they never run out of required supplies.\n\u25cf Online Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and Safety Datasheets. Agrify Insights\u2122 hosts digital copies of our included Standard Operating Procedures and datasheets, or users can upload their own via our content management system, ensuring that the most recent version of SOPs and forms are available to users.\n\u25cf Roles-Based Dashboards. Ability to obtain access to information specifically suited to your workforces various needs. Facility owners have access to high-level information about crop yields and equipment usage in an easy-to-understand scorecard. Farm managers receive a worksheet and calendar that lets them manage their workforce and automatically assign plant-touching tasks. This also provides facility managers with an ongoing window into consumables and lets them set inventory levels.\n\u25cf Data Collection. Agrify Insights\u2122 is a centralized repository for all data relating to the cultivation aspects of our clients business, including research and development testing data, and the ability to capture and compare test results. By doing so, Agrify Insights\u2122 becomes a customers cultivation statement of record.\n\u25cf Financial Simulator / What If Scenarios. Our operating expenses (OpEx) calculator enables users to evaluate impacts to profitability by changing hundreds of attributes including, but not limited to, changes to costs in labor, electric, water, CO2, and growing media as well as potential volatility in yields and pricing.\n\u25cf Regulatory Reporting Integration. We have integrated our software with Metrc, a leading seed-to-harvest compliance management and tracking solution, which will enable our customers to handle most regulatory reporting directly through Agrify Insights\u2122.\nCultivation Deployment Options\nRapid Deployment Pack (RDP) Program\nThe RDP program was established in 2022 to make it easier for a broader range of customers to access our award-winning cultivation technology. Featuring our flagship VFUs in a prepackaged, self-contained, and quick-to-deploy format, the thoughtfully designed and engineered RDPs offer an accelerated path to production, cash flow, and profitability for customers. By removing certain barriers and points of friction with the RDPs,\u202fwe can provide customers who have properly equipped facilities with best-in-class cultivation capabilities in potentially as little as 90 days. Once installed, the modular nature of the RDPs allows for seamless expansion opportunities, enabling customers the flexibility to grow and scale.\nTTK Solution\nWhile we do not intend to enter into any new TTK Solutions for the foreseeable future, we have deployed this program with certain key customers. We also believe that our data-driven TTK Solution for cultivation solutions is unlike any other customer solution being offered and enables our customers to get to market faster by providing them with our seamlessly integrated hardware and software offerings as well as access to capital and a wide range of associated services from experts including consulting, training, design, engineering, and construction to form what we believe is the most complete solution available from a single provider. We engage qualified cannabis operators in the early phases of their business plans and provide critical support, typically over a 10-year period.\n\u202f\nOur TTK Solution provides our valued customers with the benefit of working with a single, highly qualified provider in what has historically been a decentralized market full of piecemeal solutions that were not necessarily designed and engineered to work harmoniously with one another. Given the significant shortcomings associated with traditional indoor grow methods across all commercial agriculture segments, it was apparent that a new paradigm in indoor cultivation was needed, which is why we have brought a more modern, manufacturing style approach that is process driven through technology and measured via data and analytics. Overall, our holistic approach to addressing our customers cultivation needs treats their production facilities as an end-to-end ecosystem whose success depends on all components working together optimally. Despite the rapidly growing cannabis and hemp industry, many growers and processors face some significant obstacles to their operations that pose a serious threat to their long-term viability.\n\u202f\nWe believe Agrifys proprietary TTK Solution is the key to resolving many of the challenges our customers encounter. We have set ourselves apart by bringing to market a horticulturist expertise, bundled solution of state-of-the-art equipment, software and services that is turn-key, end-to-end, fully integrated and optimized for precision growing and extraction. Agrifys TTK Solution provides customers with the following bundled equipment and services:\n\u25cf Facility design, lab design, and engineering services\n\u25cf Facility and lab build-out project management\n\u25cf Agrify VFUs\n\u25cf Agrify data driven Agrify Insights\u2122\n\u25cf Agrify extraction products\n\u25cf Expert horticulturist training and ongoing support\nExtraction Solutions\nWhile we do not extract, come in contact with, distribute, process, or dispense cannabis or hemp or any cannabis or hemp derivatives that are currently prohibited under U.S. federal law, our extraction equipment and business solutions can be used within indoor processing facilities by fully licensed cannabis and hemp cultivators and processors or in some cases, by individual processors for individual use in compliance with applicable law. We sell our proprietary extraction solutions to independent, licensed cultivators and processing labs.\nCannabis represents a potential cornucopia of medicinal and pharmaceutical advancement. Cannabis produces over 550 different phytochemicals, over 120 of which are cannabinoids like tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Other cannabinoids like varins, cannabigerivarin (CBGV), tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV), and cannabidivarin (CBDV) are less well known and potentially offer significant value.\u202fAs we continue to learn more about the complex chemical composition of cannabis, the need for distillation solutions is clear.\u202fDistillation enables the identification, isolation, and separation of valuable cannabis metabolites.\u202fThe ability to take cannabis compounds distilled into their pure forms, and then recombine them into specific, purposeful end-products could have significant potential for the pharmaceutical industry in the future.\nAs stated previously, we strategically acquired four of the top brands in the extraction space in late 2021 and early 2022 in Precision Extraction, PurePressure, Lab Society, and Cascade Sciences. These iconic brands encompass everything from hydrocarbon, alcohol, and solventless extraction to distillation and post-processing and have supported and continue to support over 90% of legal operators in one fashion or another.\nCombined, these four acquisitions provide what we believe to be the most comprehensive extraction solutions from a single provider, with over 7,000 customers, including over 30 Multi-State-Operators, and some of the best extraction labs in the industry. Our leading extraction brands provide equipment and solutions for extraction, post-processing, and testing for the cannabis and hemp industries. The extraction, post-processing and testing services are complementary and highly attractive areas of the supply chain.\nOur extraction division now offers cutting-edge technologies and end-to-end service solutions. Solutions from the extraction division include equipment, technology, facility and lab design, training, and extensive research and development capabilities. By providing new hardware-as-a-service we intend to capture higher margin recurring revenue and supply chain optimization through streamlined product sourcing, purchasing, manufacturing, and warehousing.\nThese acquisitions have greatly expanded our product and service offerings in the post-harvest segment of the supply chain. We believe we are positioning Agrify as one of the most vertically integrated total solutions provider for our cannabis and hemp customers. According to a report published by Grand View Research in November 2022, the global cannabis extraction market is expected to potentially grow to $15.5 billion by 2030, and as the cannabis industry continues to experience rapid growth globally, we expect the sales of our extraction solutions to follow a similar growth trajectory.\nCannabis Market Opportunity\nWhile we do not cultivate, come in contact with, distribute or dispense cannabis or any cannabis derivatives that are currently prohibited under U.S. federal law, our cultivation solutions can be used within state-licensed indoor grow facilities by cannabis cultivators if they choose to do so.\nIn the U.S., the development and growth of the regulated medical and recreational (adult-use) cannabis industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation, and accordingly, the market varies on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate cannabis for medicinal reasons allow patients to consume cannabis with a designated healthcare providers recommendation, subject to various requirements and limitations. As of January 2023, 39 states have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis. On top of this medical condition growth trend, there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of states that have chosen to legalize cannabis for recreational use. As of January 2023, 21 states have passed laws allowing their citizens to use recreational cannabis. Shifting public attitudes and state law and legislative activity are driving this change as indicated by a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University that found that 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis if recommended by a doctor, which was the same level of support from a similar poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in 2018. Similarly, the trend toward further legalization and regulation of cannabis sales is spreading globally. As of the date of this report, over 70 countries outside the U.S. currently have medicinal cannabis regulation in force, and that number is expected to significantly increase over time.\nGiven that the market size of legal cannabis in the U.S. in 2022 was estimated to be $27.7 billion according to MarketsandMarkets research Pvt Ltd, and 88% of legal U.S. cannabis cultivators grow indoors (Fluence 2022 Industry lighting report), we estimate that the indoor segment of the legal U.S. cannabis sector is a $10 billion market with the expectation that there will be even more growth on the horizon. A recent report from statista.com projected global cannabis revenue to reach $47.2 billion in 2023, with annual growth rate of 12.69%, with a projected global market volume of $76.1 billion by 2027.\nThe different cultivation environments for cannabis each have advantages and disadvantages, and this leads to a variance in price points based on quality, actual and perceived, and process. According to New Leaf Data Services January 27, 2023 U.S. cannabis spot index, the average wholesale price per pound of an outdoor-grown flower was $408 per pound, greenhouse flower averaged $633 per pound, while indoor-grown flower averaged $1,298 per pound and the total market on average was $977 per pound. Based on the Fluence 2022 state of the cannabis industry lighting report, 88% of cultivators have some or all of their facilities growing indoors, up 9% over 2021.\nCompetitive Landscape\nWe believe our full suite of product offerings forms an unmatched ecosystem for indoor growing and extraction. At this time, our VFUs, Agrify Insights\u2122, extraction solutions, our facility design and build services, and our engineering/installation services are highly differentiated from anything else on the market.\nAt the same time, our customers are actively being approached by a variety of companies who do offer compelling standalone products and services, so we recognize that our customers do have choices and alternatives, and they also need to factor in opportunity costs whenever they make purchasing decisions. Consequently, we more broadly define our competition as any other company going after the same finite budget dollars as us in the indoor agriculture space. We have highlighted below the most notable players that operate across some of the same functional, highly fragmented areas of agriculture technology that we operate.\n\u25cf Semi-Integrated Vertical Cultivation Systems - Sprout AI\n\u25cf Aeroponic Systems - AEssenceGrows and Thrive Growing\n\u25cf Horticultural Lighting - Gavita, Fluence, VividGro, Hydrofarm, GrowGeneration, Hawthorne and Heliospectra\n\u25cf Extraction Solutions - ExtractionTek Solutions, Mach Technologies, Decimal Engineering, Low Temp Plates, Whistler Technologies, Maratek and Hashatron\n\u25cf Monitoring Software - Grownetics and Trym\n\u25cf Cultivation Software - Quantum Leaf, Flourish, and Grow Link\n\u25cf Vertical Cultivation Racking Systems - Pipp Horticulture and Montel\nDespite the presence of some well-funded and well-established competitors who offer pieces of what we do, we are able to compete on the basis of several defensible factors including our industry experience, our technical expertise, the differentiated value proposition of our individual offerings, and our positioning as a single-source provider. However, we believe above all else, it is our ability to offer an unrivaled level of precision through a total end-to-end turnkey solution that sets us apart from existing competitors and potential new market entrants.\nOur Competitive Strengths\nWe believe our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following competitive strengths:\n\u25cf Innovative Technology in an Attractive Growing Industry. Our innovative solutions are aimed at large and growing U.S. domestic and global markets. We believe we are the only provider of a fully integrated end-to-end hardware and software turnkey solution for indoor cultivation and extraction facilities that allows customers to produce high-quality products with consistency at scale while meeting the growing demand and needs of end users at a relatively low cost. As such, we believe we have a first mover advantage due to innovating this new type of smart cannabis and hemp cultivation and processing solution, which is already designed, manufactured, and implemented in several commercial scale deployments across multiple states within the U.S.\n\u25cf Integrated Proprietary Components. We design and create our own hardware, software, and SOPs from the ground up rather than buying piecemeal from third parties. We take a systems-engineered integrated approach that we believe has inherent advantages over other, ad-hoc systems.\n\u25cf Emphasis on Precision and Consistency Through Our Proprietary Grow Solutions. While being able to help our customers increase capacity, yield and consequently revenues holds a tremendous amount of value, we believe that our biggest differentiator is our ability to impact the actual quality and consistency of the output by controlling the environment in which the crops are grown and all the variables that influence harvests with an unparalleled level of precision. The by-product of our TTK Solution is that our customers can create consistent high-quality products with repeatability from anywhere similar to any other consumer product company that provides a branded food or drink product.\n\u25cf Emphasis on Precision and Consistency Through Our Extraction Division. In addition to our premium grow solutions, we have begun offering our customers industry leading cannabis and hemp extraction equipment, design, and training solutions. By acquiring leading brands earlier this year, we are immediately able to offer our customers premium solutions to meet their processing needs in this rapidly expanding sector.\n\u25cf Market Knowledge and Understanding. We have extensive experience with controlled agriculture environments, extraction, post-processing, and scale-up manufacturing, as well as industry technical knowledge and relationships. We are keenly aware of the struggles that indoor cultivators and extractors face, and we serve as a credible and collaborative partner through the entire customer lifecycle. We believe that our fully integrated TTK Solution, extraction equipment and ancillary services are the key to resolving many of the challenges our customers face.\n\u25cf Differentiated Business Model. Unlike many of our competitors, we offer a diversified mix of hardware, software, and services, which leads to potential multiple revenue streams. Given the nature of our deployments, we become deeply embedded in our customers operations through our numerous product offerings. This puts us in a position where customer success is directly tied to our equipment. Our ability to differentiate our business model provides us with multiple opportunities to expand our installed user base, which we believe will lead to future high-margin and stable recurring SaaS revenues, via our Agrify Insights\u2122 and production fee revenues.\nOur Customers\nWe primarily market and sell our products to newly licensed, well-funded producers in a single market as well as multi-state operators. Our customers choose us for several reasons, including the breadth and availability of the products we offer, our extensive expertise, and the quality of our customer service. For large multi-state operators, our solutions allow operators to produce consistent high-quality products regardless of the geographic locations where they are licensed to operate. Our system removes the variations of local grow environments, and also provides consistent standard operating procedures across different facilities, helping every facility to achieve the highest Good Manufacturing Processes standards. Our ability to provide a one-stop shop experience allows us to be the preferred vendor to many of these customers by streamlining their entry or expansion of their cultivation capabilities. In addition, we believe our customers find great value in the advice and recommendations provided by our knowledgeable sales and service associates, which further increases demand for our products.\nWe believe the nature of our solutions and our high-touch customer service model strengthens relationships, builds loyalty and drives repeat business as our customers businesses expand. In addition, we feel as if our premium product lines and comprehensive product portfolio position us well to meet our customers needs. Furthermore, we fully anticipate that we will be able to leverage all the data that we are collecting from our existing customer base to make continuous improvements to our offerings and better serve our current and new customers in the future.\nTo date, we have customers across the U.S. and internationally in the cannabis and hemp industry and are of all sizes, ranging from small, single location businesses to multi-state enterprise operations that use Agrifys solutions. For each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had two customers that represented more than 10% of total revenues.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe have developed a multi-pronged growth strategy as described below to help us capitalize on the sizable opportunity at hand. Through methodical sales and marketing efforts, cultivation and extraction solutions, and scale-up manufacturing, we believe we have implemented several key initiatives we can use to grow our business more effectively. We also intend to opportunistically pursue the strategies described below to continue our upward trajectory and enhance shareholder value. We believe we have significantly improved our new bookings and qualified pipeline. With our expanded product line that includes quality extraction solutions, we have become more attractive to our prospects and customers, enhancing our overall appeal and the scope of opportunities we are able to pursue. We expect our qualified pipeline and new bookings of opportunities to continue to grow.\nSales and Marketing\nRigorous Sales Process and Strong Infrastructure in Place to Drive Revenue Growth\nWe utilize a highly structured sales process to evaluate potential new opportunities and then advance vetted prospects through the different phases of our qualified pipeline. Our salespeople spend most of their time building relationships and qualifying opportunities to make closing new business more streamlined, collaborative, and organic in nature. There are specific requirements, milestones, and events that we have identified along the sales process that must be met to move prospects through and convert them from vetted opportunities into committed sales orders within a 12-month period. At each phase of the pipeline, a prospect opportunity is assigned a probability value for closing, providing management production forecast ability.\nOur sales team works to convert our qualified pipeline of opportunities into confirmed contractual bookings. Given our emphasis on enterprise sales opportunities, we believe we are able to significantly scale our business in the coming year without significant increases in our headcount. At the time of this report, our sales team was comprised of one Sales Vice President, Directors of Business Development, Account Managers, Channel Partner Managers, Customer Support and Success Manager, Customer Service Support Reps, and a Sales Support Admin. Additionally, we take measures to ensure that all members of the sales organization are cross-trained on cultivation and extraction products.\nWe believe our business has, and our future success will be driven by, the following sales and marketing strategy:\n\u25cf Direct Marketing. We capitalize on our direct marketing efforts by utilizing our internal CRM database, as well as the external help of trusted industry databases to target the right audience. Emails go out on a weekly basis and are subdivided by product focus and state, depending on the campaign. We use A/B testing in our email campaign strategy to harness meaningful messages.\n\u25cf Social Media and Thought Leadership. Through the creation and promotion of engaging content that positions us as a thought leader, we continue to organically grow our social media audience. We share original videos, photography, industry-related articles, and blog content on a consistent basis. By developing strong relationships with our customers and sharing testimonials as well as live footage of our products being in action, we are better positioning ourselves on social. Furthermore, we promote our social media in our email communications, on our website, and through paid advertising. We also keep our finger on the pulse of trends and competitors in the market, remaining in the know.\n\u25cf Trade Shows. Trade shows and events related to the cannabis industry have proven to be highly effective. When attending trade shows and events, we typically position ourselves front and center, with high-level sponsorships, outstanding booth placement, and speaking opportunities. Our product and subject matter experts take advantage of speaking opportunities, positioning Agrify as an industry thought leader. We expect to continue to grow our industry presence by generating leads using conferences as a platform. The trade show plan has been carefully vetted to ensure that these shows are reputable, have a strong business-to-business focus, high foot-traffic rates, as well as hosted in a desirable market.\n\u25cf Paid Advertising. We utilize paid advertising such as banner ads on high-trafficked media sites that largely focus on cannabis and other relevant topics. We provide content offers and other downloadable materials to capture these leads. As we gain experience through these different marketing initiatives, we will make appropriate spending adjustments with our most effective outlets. We seek to expand our business both nationally and internationally and will do so when we have proven, viable marketing options available to us.\n\u25cf Public Relations Campaigns. We have actively utilized press releases, industry and investor events, and interviews and speaking engagements to increase awareness of our brand, solutions, customer engagements, and other relevant company developments. With our industry positioning using thought leadership and ongoing participation in industry conferences, we have been highlighted through the Newswire and featured in a variety of media outlets. We will continue to sponsor and present keynotes at industry-related events including technology and agriculture conferences, podcasts, radio shows and more to continue to gain press and ultimately more exposure.\nScale-Up Manufacturing Capabilities in Order to Meet the Increasing Demand for Our Grow Solutions\nWe currently use both internal and external manufacturing to support our increasing demand. Internal production is primarily at our Michigan, Colorado, and Georgia facilities. Externally, we use a variety of contract manufacturers (CMs) in the U.S. and in Asia for prototyping and volume manufacturing, and we plan to expand our capabilities to meet the increasing demand for our grow solutions. We design the systems internally, and then work with our CMs and suppliers to refine, prototype, and test the designs. The designs are documented at a level that allows us to have our products manufactured at multiple CMs, both in the U.S. and abroad. As demand increases beyond our internal capacities additional volume can be shifted to external manufacturing to ensure market demands are met.\nOverall, our approach to manufacturing is to use both internal and external manufacturing capabilities to prototype, iterate, and begin initial production, then transition to volume production. As volumes increase, this will also include increasing production in lower-cost geographies, which results in both rapid time-to-market and low production costs. As we grow, we intend to continually analyze and evolve our manufacturing capabilities to best meet our customers needs while always focusing on ways to maximize operating margins.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret, including federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and other countries, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants, and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements and to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived under their respective employment, consultant, or advisor agreement, using our property, or which relate to our business. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our business is affected by our ability to protect against misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, patents, domain names, copyrights and other proprietary rights.\nPatents\nWe hold 20 patents in the U.S. We also have one pending patent application. These patents and patents applications are directed to, among other things, extraction and processing of botanicals and particular compounds.\nTrademarks and Copyrights\nWe own or have applications for numerous national and state trademarks which are essential to our businesses, including Agrify, Precision, PurePressure, PressWare, Lab Society and Elitelab, among others. In addition, we recognize common-law trademark rights AGRIFY INSIGHTS and AGRINAMICS for SaaS products.\nOur subsidiary, Agrify Brands, LLC is the owner of certain common-law trademarks that it licenses to third parties. Marks covered by the license include, DAWG STAR (including multiple logo designs), WESTERN CULTURED (including multiple logo designs), TWISTED LEGION (logo), WAXTRONAUT (including multiple logo designs) and WAXTRONAUT COSMICALLY CURATED EXTRACTS.\nAlthough we have not sought copyright registration for our technology or works to date, we rely on common law copyright and trade secret protections in relation to our TechOps/ Agrify Insights\u2122 computer program for indoor agriculture management. We have registered our Internet domain names related to our business. We license software from third parties and utilize open-source software for integration into our applications.\nIn addition, while we know that our current product and service capabilities are highly novel and compelling, we do not intend to be complacent. We will continue to learn from our customers and from the market, and if there is an opportunity to deploy a new and improved version of one of our offerings or if we decide there is room in the market for a new type of solution, we fully intend to diligently explore those possibilities to augment our existing business and grow our reach.\nHuman Capital Resources\nAs of October 1, 2023, we had a total of 72 employees, of which 72 are full-time employees, with 10 located in the New England area, 18 in Colorado, 26 in Michigan, 5 in Georgia, and 13 located in other states. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nWe strive to attract and retain diverse, high-caliber employees who raise the talent bar by offering competitive compensation and benefit packages, regardless of their gender, race, or other personal characteristics. We regularly review and survey our compensation and benefit programs against the market to ensure we remain competitive in our hiring practices. We provide employee salaries that are competitive and consider factors such as an employees role and experience, the location of their job and their performance. In addition to our competitive salaries, to enhance our employees sense of participation in the company and to further align their interests with those of our stockholders, we offer equity packages to a majority of our employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plan are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.\nWe strive to hire, develop, and retain talent that continuously raises the performance bar. We encourage, support, and compensate our employees based on our philosophy of recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance. We believe that performance and development is an ongoing process in which all employees should be active participants. Individual and company key performance goals are linked to employee compensation.\nRegulatory Implications of Providing Equipment and Services in the Cannabis and Hemp Industry\nWe sell products and services that end users may purchase for use in industries or segments, including the growing and processing of cannabis and hemp, which are subject to varying, inconsistent, and rapidly changing laws, regulations, administrative practices, enforcement approaches, judicial interpretations, and consumer perceptions. For example, certain countries and 36 U.S. states have adopted frameworks that authorize, regulate, and tax the cultivation, processing, sale, and use of cannabis for medicinal and/or non-medicinal use, while the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and the laws of other U.S. states prohibit growing cannabis. In addition, with the passage of the Farm Bill in December 2018, hemp cultivation is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also removes restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law. Our products are multi-purpose products and may be used on a wide range of plants and are purchased by cultivators who may grow any variety of plants, including cannabis and hemp.\nAlthough the majority of states now have laws that regulate or decriminalize various types of cannabis use, marijuana remains a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act, making it illegal under federal law in the U.S. to, among other things, cultivate, distribute or possess cannabis in the U.S. In those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law pursuant to the Controlled Substances Act. The Controlled Substances Act classifies marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance, and as such, medical and adult cannabis use is illegal under U.S. federal law. Unless and until the U.S. Congress amends the Controlled Substances Act with respect to marijuana (and the President approves such amendment), there is a risk that federal authorities may enforce current federal law. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the U.S. may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S. federal money laundering legislation. The approach to enforcement of such laws by the federal government in the U.S. has trended toward non-enforcement against individuals and businesses that comply with medical or adult-use cannabis regulatory programs in states where such programs are legal, strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis.\nIn most states that have legalized medical- and recreational-use cannabis in some form, the growing, processing and/or dispensing of cannabis generally requires that the operator obtain one or more licenses in accordance with applicable state requirements. In addition, many states regulate various aspects of the growing, processing and/or dispensing of cannabis and hemp. Local governments in some cases also impose rules and regulations on the manner of operating cannabis and hemp businesses. As a result, applicable state and local laws and regulations vary widely, including, but not limited to, regulations governing the medical cannabis program, product testing, the level of enforcement by state and local authorities on non-licensed cannabis operators, state and local taxation of regulated cannabis products, local municipality bans on operations and operator licensing processes and renewals.\nAs part of its rigorous due diligence policy on all potential customers, the Company carefully reviews the appropriate licensure of each potential customer in the cannabis and hemp industry for compliance with applicable local, state, and federal laws. The Company is not involved in the cultivation, processing, or retail of cannabis products and never takes a controlling interest in any of the operations of its cannabis customers as a matter of state law.\nImplications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, which we refer to as the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. Accordingly, for so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\n\u25cf engage an auditor to report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\n\u25cf submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay, say-on-frequency, and say-on-golden parachutes; or\n\u25cf disclose certain executive compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and the comparison of the chief executive officers compensation to median employee compensation.\nIn addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest to occur of:\n\u25cf our reporting $1 billion or more in annual gross revenues;\n\u25cf our issuance, in a three-year period, of more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt;\n\u25cf the end of the fiscal year in which the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter; and\n\u25cf December 31, 2026.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions, which could result in a less active trading market for our securities and increased volatility in the price of our securities.\nFinally, we are a smaller reporting company (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and accordingly may provide less public disclosure than larger public companies, including the inclusion of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.\nCorporate Information\nOur executive offices are located at 2468 Industrial Row, Dr., Troy, Michigan 48084. Our telephone number at our executive offices is (855) 420-0020.\nAgrify Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 6, 2016, originally incorporated as Agrinamics, Inc. (or Agrinamics). On September 16, 2019, Agrinamics amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to Agrify Corporation.\nAvailable Information\nThe Companys Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), are filed with the SEC.

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Common Stock. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Common Stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe have a history of losses, expect to continue to incur losses in the near term and may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future, and as a result, our management has identified, and our auditors agreed that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Since inception, we have experienced recurring net losses which losses caused an accumulated deficit of approximately $247.1 million as of December 31, 2022. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe have a relatively short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects.\nWe have a relatively short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business and future prospects. We have been in existence since June 2016 and much of our revenue growth has occurred during 2021 and 2022. We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and difficulties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, including those related to:\n\u25cf market acceptance of our current and future products and services;\n\u25cf changing regulatory environments and costs associated with compliance, particularly as related to our operations in the cannabis sector;\n\u25cf our ability to compete with other companies offering similar products and services;\n\u25cf our ability to effectively market our products and services and attract new clients;\n\u25cf the amount and timing of operating expenses, particularly sales and marketing expenses, related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations, and infrastructure;\n\u25cf our ability to control costs, including operating expenses;\n\u25cf our ability to manage organic growth and growth fueled by acquisitions;\n\u25cf public perception and acceptance of cannabis-related products and services generally; and\n\u25cf general economic conditions and events.\nIf we do not manage these risks successfully, our business and financial performance will be adversely affected.\nPotential risk of loss associated with our TTK Solution Offerings\nDuring 2021, we introduced our TTK Solution, which among other things, includes financing arrangements related to both facility design and build services and equipment. These arrangements require a significant upfront investment of working capital over a one- to two-year period, before we start to receive repayment on the upfront construction advances and on our recurring monthly SaaS fees and production fees.\nAs of December 31, 2022, a significant amount of our working capital has been invested in funding our TTK Solution construction and equipment commitments.\nWe believe that there is a potential risk of loss associated with our ability to receive anticipated future payments that are in line with our projected financial unit metrics due to a host of variables including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf as we are in the early stages of our TTK Solution offerings, the TTK Solution is currently an unproven business model;\n\u25cf the TTK Solution offering requires a significant amount of capital and our collection of advanced amounts is subject to customer credit risk;\n\u25cf our anticipated downstream production fee revenue assumes that our VFUs will successfully produce 35 pounds of product per VFU per year; and\n\u25cf our anticipated returns are reliant upon our customers ability to market and sell the products.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we established a reserve of approximately $12.5 million specifically related to Greenstone Holdings (Greenstone) TTK Solution. Greenstone is a related party because one of our former Agrify Brands employees and our VP of Engineering had a minority ownership. We established the reserve based upon our review of Greenstones financial stability, which would impact collectability, which is primarily the result of unfavorable market conditions within the Colorado market. On April 6, 2023, Denver Greens, LLC (Denver Greens) acquired certain interests in the Greenstone project through various transactions so that Denver Greens is now the operator of this TTK Solution. The Company wrote off the entire Greenstone loan receivable in 2022.\nOn September 15, 2022, we provided a notice of default under the Bud & Marys TTK Agreement between us and Bud & Marys. On October 5, 2022, Bud & Marys filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Suffolk County naming us as the defendant. Bud & Marys is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract, and conversion arising from the Bud & Marys TTK Agreement. In response, we established a reserve of $14.7 million specifically related to Bud & Marys. We deemed it necessary to fully reserve the $14.7 million outstanding balance in the third quarter of 2022 due to the current litigation and the uncertainty of the customers ability to repay the outstanding balance. If we are unable to realize revenue from our TTK Solution offerings on a timely basis, or at all, or if we incur additional losses as a result of the Bud & Marys claim, our business and financial performance will be adversely affected.\nWe may require additional financing to achieve our goals, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital when needed on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our product manufacturing and development, and other operations.\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $20.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Our restricted cash of $10 million is associated with a senior secured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of $65 million (the SPA Note) which was exchanged for a new senior secured note (the Exchange Note) as of December 31, 2022. Our operating plan may change because of factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. Even if we are able to substantially increase revenue and reduce operational expenditures, we may need to raise additional capital, either through borrowings, private offerings, public offerings, or some type of business combination, such as a merger or buyout, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuits. Accordingly, if we are unable to generate adequate cash from operations, and if we are unable to find sources of funding, it may be necessary for us to sell one or more lines of business or all or a portion of our assets, enter into a business combination, or reduce or eliminate operations. These possibilities, to the extent available, may be on terms that result in significant dilution to our shareholders or that result in our investors losing all of their investment in our company.\nAs of April 1, 2023, after which time the ATM program was discontinued, we sold 629,710 shares of Common Stock, under the ATM at an average price of $27.29 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to us of $17.2 million, and net proceeds of $16.7 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $516 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the investor (the Investor) under the Exchange Note.\nIf we are able to raise additional capital, we do not know what the terms of any such capital raising would be. In addition, any future sale of our equity securities would dilute the ownership and control of your shares and could be at prices substantially below prices at which our shares currently trade. Our inability to raise capital could require us to significantly curtail or terminate our operations. We may seek to increase our cash reserves through the sale of additional equity or debt securities. The sale of convertible debt securities or additional equity securities could result in additional and potentially substantial dilution to our shareholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations and liquidity, and ability to pay dividends. In addition, our ability to obtain additional capital on acceptable terms is subject to a variety of uncertainties. We cannot assure you that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Any failure to raise additional funds on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe face risks associated with strategic acquisitions.\nSince our inception, we have strategically acquired several businesses, and plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions, some of which may be material. These acquisitions may involve a number of financial, accounting, managerial, operational, legal, compliance, and other risks and challenges, including the following, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations:\n\u25cf any acquired business could under-perform relative to our expectations and the price that we paid for it, or not perform in accordance with its anticipated timetable;\n\u25cf we may incur or assume significant debt in connection with our acquisitions;\n\u25cf acquisitions could cause our results of operations to differ from our own or the investment communitys expectations in any given period, or over the long term; and\n\u25cf acquisitions could create demands on our management that they may be unable to effectively address, or for which we may incur additional costs.\nAdditionally, following any business acquisition, we could experience difficulty in integrating personnel, operations, financial and other systems, and in retaining key employees and customers.\nWe may record goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet in connection with our acquisitions. If we are not able to realize the value of these assets, we may be required to incur charges relating to the impairment of these assets, which could materially impact our results of operations.\nWe have substantial debt and other financial obligations, and we may incur even more debt. Any failure to meet our debt and other financial obligations or maintain compliance with related covenants could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn March 14, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement) with an accredited investor (the Investor), pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell to the Investor the SPA Note, in a private placement transaction, in exchange for the payment by the Investor of $65 million, less applicable expenses as set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement, and a warrant (the SPA Warrant) to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock.\nOn August 18, 2022, we reached an agreement with the Investor to amend the existing SPA Note and entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the August 2022 Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, we partially paid $35.2 million along with approximately $300 thousand in repayments for other fees under the SPA Note and exchanged the remaining balance of the SPA Note for a new senior secured note with an aggregate original principal amount of $35.0 million and a new warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock (the Note Exchange Warrant). Additionally, we exchanged the SPA Warrant for a new warrant for the same number of underlying shares but with a reduced exercise price (the Modified Warrant and, collectively with the Note Exchange Warrant, the August 2022 Warrants). The Exchange Note will mature on the three-year anniversary of its issuance.\nOn March 8, 2023, we entered into a second Securities Exchange Agreement with the Investor (the March 2023 Exchange Agreement and together with the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, the Exchange Agreements), pursuant to which we paid approximately $10.3 million in principal under the Exchange Note and exchanged $10.0 million in principal amount under the Exchange Note for a new senior convertible note (the Convertible Note and, together with the Exchange Note, the Notes) with an original principal amount of $10.0 million. The Convertible Note will mature on August 19, 2025.\nOn October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC (the New Lender), an entity affiliated with and controlled by Raymond Chang, our Chief Executive Officer, acquired the Notes from the Investor.\nPursuant to the terms of the Notes, we are subject to various covenants, including negative covenants that restrict our ability to engage in certain transactions, which may limit our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Such negative covenants include, among other things, limitations on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n\u25cf incur debt;\n\u25cf incur liens;\n\u25cf make investments (including acquisitions);\n\u25cf sell assets; and\n\u25cf pay dividends on our capital stock.\nIn addition, the Notes impose certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon us, as well as covenants that restrict us and our subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries from making certain investments, subject to specified exceptions, and restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions.\nIf we are not in compliance with certain of these covenants, in addition to other actions the New Lender may require, the amounts outstanding under the Exchange Agreements may become immediately due and payable. This immediate payment may negatively impact our financial condition. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient to pay interest and principal on our debt in the future. If that should occur, our capital raising or debt restructuring measures may be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet our scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and further impair our liquidity.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations and comply with financial covenants depends on our financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance will continue to be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Failure within any applicable grace or cure periods to make such payments, comply with the financial covenants, or any other non-financial or restrictive covenant, would create a default under the Notes. Our cash flow and existing capital resources may be insufficient to repay our debt at maturity, in which case we would have to extend such maturity date, or otherwise repay, refinance, and/or restructure the obligations under the Notes, including with proceeds from the sale of assets, and additional equity or debt capital. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining such extension, or entering into such repayment, refinance, or restructure prior to maturity, or any other default existed under the Notes, the New Lender could accelerate the indebtedness under the Notes, foreclose against its collateral, or seek other remedies, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our current operations.\nWe may be required to record impairment charges against the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets in the future.\nDuring the three-month period ended June 30, 2022, we identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in our stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, we deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of our property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022.\nBased on its interim testing, we noted that the carrying value of equity exceeded the calculated fair value by an amount greater than the aggregate value of our goodwill and intangible assets. Accordingly, we concluded that the entire carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets were impaired, resulting in a second-quarter impairment charge of $69.9 million. Additional information regarding the interim testing on goodwill may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, two customers accounted for approximately $16.8 million, or 28.8%, of our total revenue. In the event of any material decrease in revenue from these customers, or if we are unable to replace the revenue through the sale of our products to additional customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThis concentration of customers leaves us exposed to the risks associated with the loss of one or both of these significant customers, which would materially and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, some customers have experienced and may continue to experience construction delays in building out their facilities and we have been assisting these customers in addressing these delays, including in certain cases extending their payment terms. Any continued delays will likely result in a negative impact on our revenues. Further, if these customers were to significantly reduce their relationship with us, or in the event that we are unable to replace the revenue through the sale of our products to additional customers, our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted, and such impact would likely be significant.\nOur reliance on a limited base of suppliers for our products may result in disruptions to our supply chain and business and adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely on a limited number of suppliers for our products and other supplies. If we are unable to maintain supplier arrangements and relationships, if we are unable to contract with suppliers at the quantity and quality levels needed for our business, if any of our key suppliers becomes insolvent or experiences other financial distress or if any of our key suppliers is negatively impacted by COVID-19, including with respect to staffing and shipping of products, we could experience disruptions in our supply chain, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nMany of our suppliers are experiencing operational difficulties as a result of COVID-19, which in turn may have an adverse effect on our ability to provide products to our customers.\nThe measures being taken to combat the pandemic are impacting our suppliers and may destabilize our supply chain. For example, manufacturing plants have closed and work at others has been curtailed in many places where we source our products. Some of our suppliers have had to temporarily close a facility for disinfecting after employees tested positive for COVID-19, and others have faced staffing shortages from employees who are sick or apprehensive about coming to work. Further, the ability of our suppliers to ship their goods to us has become difficult as transportation networks and distribution facilities have had reduced capacity and have been dealing with changes in the types of goods being shipped.\nAlthough the ability of our suppliers to timely ship their goods has affected some of our deliveries, currently the difficulties experienced by our suppliers have not yet materially impacted our ability to deliver products to our customers and we do not significantly depend on any one supplier; however, if this continues, it may negatively affect any inventory we may have and more significantly delay the delivery of merchandise to our customers, which in turn will adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. If the difficulties experienced by our suppliers continue, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to locate alternative sources of supply for our merchandise on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to adequately purchase appropriate amounts of supplies for our products, our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nAs a company with clients operating in the cannabis industry, we face many particular and evolving risks associated with that industry.\nWe currently serve private clients as they operate in the growing cannabis industry. Any risks related to the cannabis industry that may adversely affect our clients and potential clients may, in turn, adversely affect demand for our products. Specific risks faced by companies operating in the cannabis industry include, but are not limited to, the following:\nMarijuana remains illegal under U.S. federal law\nMarijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance under the Controlled Substances Act and is illegal under federal law. It remains illegal under U.S. Federal law to grow, cultivate, sell, or possess marijuana for any purpose or to assist or conspire with those who do so. Additionally, 21 U.S.C. 856 makes it illegal to knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place, whether permanently or temporarily, for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been authorized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana is not preempted by state laws that legalize its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our clients inability to proceed with their operations, which would adversely affect demands for our products.\nUncertainty of federal enforcement and the need to renew temporary safeguards\nOn January 4, 2018, former Attorney General Sessions rescinded the previously issued memoranda (known as the Cole Memorandum) from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that had de-prioritized the enforcement of federal law against marijuana users and businesses that comply with state marijuana laws, adding uncertainty to the question of how the federal government will choose to enforce federal laws regarding marijuana. Attorney General Sessions issued a memorandum to all U.S. Attorneys in which the DOJ affirmatively rescinded the previous guidance as to marijuana enforcement, calling such guidance unnecessary. This one-page memorandum was vague in nature, stating that federal prosecutors should use established principles in setting their law enforcement priorities. Under previous administrations, the DOJ indicated that those users and suppliers of medical marijuana who complied with state laws, which required compliance with certain criteria, would not be prosecuted. As a result, it is now unclear if the DOJ will seek to enforce the Controlled Substances Act against those users and suppliers who comply with state marijuana laws.\nDespite former Attorney General Sessions rescission of the Cole Memorandum, the Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, has not rescinded the FinCEN Memo dated February 14, 2014, which de-prioritizes enforcement of the Bank Secrecy Act against financial institutions and marijuana-related businesses which utilize them. This memo appears to be a standalone document and is presumptively still in effect. At any time, however, the Department of the Treasury, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, could elect to rescind the FinCEN Memo. This would make it more difficult for our clients and potential clients to access the U.S. banking systems and conduct financial transactions, which would adversely affect our operations.\nIn 2014, Congress passed a spending bill (2015 Appropriations Bill) containing a provision (Appropriations Rider) blocking federal funds and resources allocated under the 2015 Appropriations Bill from being used to prevent such States from implementing their own State medical marijuana law. The Appropriations Rider seemed to have prohibited the federal government from interfering with the ability of states to administer their medical marijuana laws, although it did not codify federal protections for medical marijuana patients and producers. Moreover, despite the Appropriations Rider, the Justice Department maintains that it can still prosecute violations of the federal marijuana ban and continue cases already in the courts. Additionally, the Appropriations Rider must be re-enacted every year. While it was continued in subsequent years and remains in effect, continued re-authorization of the Appropriations Rider cannot be guaranteed. If the Appropriations Rider is no longer in effect, the risk of federal enforcement and override of state marijuana laws would increase.\nFurther legislative development beneficial to our operations is not guaranteed\nOne aspect of our business involves selling goods and services to state-licensed cannabis cultivators. The success of our business may partly depend on the continued development of the cannabis industry and the activity of commercial business within the industry. The continued development of the cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative and regulatory authorization of cannabis at the state level and a continued laissez-faire approach by federal enforcement agencies. Any number of factors could slow or halt progress in this area. Further regulatory progress beneficial to the industry cannot be assured. While there may be ample public support for legislative action, numerous factors impact the legislative and regulatory process, including election results, scientific findings, or general public events. Any one of these factors could slow or halt progressive legislation relating to cannabis and the current tolerance for the use of cannabis by consumers, which could adversely affect demand for our products and operations.\nThe cannabis industry could face strong opposition from other industries\nWe believe that established businesses in other industries may have a strong economic interest in opposing the development of the cannabis industry. Cannabis may be seen by companies in other industries as an attractive alternative to their products, including recreational marijuana as an alternative to alcohol, and medical marijuana as an alternative to various commercial pharmaceuticals. Many industries that could view the emerging cannabis industry as an economic threat are well established, with vast economic and federal and state lobbying resources. It is possible that companies within these industries could use their resources to attempt to slow or reverse legislation legalizing cannabis. Any inroads these companies make in halting or impeding legislative initiatives that would be beneficial to the cannabis industry could have a detrimental impact on some of our clients and, in turn, on our operations.\nThe legality of marijuana could be reversed in one or more states\nThe voters or legislatures of states in which marijuana has already been legalized could potentially repeal applicable laws which permit the operation of both medical and retail marijuana businesses. These actions might force businesses, including those that are our clients, to cease operations in one or more states entirely.\nChanging legislation and evolving interpretations of law\nLaws and regulations affecting the medical and adult-use marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect some of our clients and, in turn, our operations. Local, state, and federal marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require our clients and thus us to incur substantial costs associated with modification of operations to ensure such clients compliance. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our clients businesses and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will limit the amount of cannabis growth, or related products that our commercial clients are authorized to produce. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our operations.\nOur business depends in part on client licensing\nOur business is partly dependent on certain of our customers obtaining various licenses from various municipalities and state licensing agencies. There can be no assurance that any or all licenses necessary for our clients to operate their businesses will be obtained, retained, or renewed. If a licensing body were to determine that a client of ours had violated applicable rules and regulations, there is a risk the license granted to that client could be revoked, which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that our existing clients will be able to retain their licenses going forward, or that new licenses will be granted to existing and new market entrants.\nBanking regulations could limit access to banking services\nSince the use of marijuana is illegal under federal law, there is a compelling argument that banks cannot lawfully accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with marijuana. Consequently, businesses involved in the cannabis industry often have trouble finding a bank willing to accept their business. The inability to open bank accounts may make it difficult for some of our clients to operate and their reliance on cash can result in a heightened risk of theft, which could harm their businesses and, in turn, harm our business. Although the proposal of the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act, also referred to as the SAFE Banking Act, would allow banks to work with cannabis businesses and prevent federal banking regulators from intervening or punishing those banks, the legislation still requires the approval of the U.S. Senate. There can be no assurance that the SAFE Banking Act will become law in the U.S. Additionally, most courts have denied marijuana-related businesses bankruptcy protection, thus making it very difficult for lenders to recoup their investments, which may limit the willingness of banks to lend to our clients and to us.\nWe may face insurance risks\nIn the U.S., many marijuana-related businesses are subject to a lack of adequate insurance coverage. In addition, many insurance companies may deny claims for any loss relating to marijuana or marijuana-related operations based on their illegality under federal law, noting that a contract for an illegal transaction is unenforceable.\nWe participate in an evolving industry\nThe cannabis industry is not yet well-developed, and many aspects of this industrys development and evolution cannot be accurately predicted. While we have attempted to identify many risks specific to the cannabis industry, you should carefully consider that there are other risks that cannot be foreseen or are not described in this report, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance. We expect that the cannabis market and our business will evolve in ways that are difficult to predict. Our long-term success may depend on our ability to successfully adjust our strategy to meet the changing market dynamics. If we are unable to successfully adapt to changes in the cannabis industry, our operations could be adversely affected.\nThe inability of our customers to meet their financial or contractual obligations to us may result in disruption to our results of operations and could result in financial losses.\nWe have exposure to several customers and certain of these customers are experiencing financial difficulties. We have in the past, and may in the future, need to take allowances against and need to write off receivables due to the creditworthiness of these customers. Further, the inability of these customers to purchase our products could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nChanges in our credit profile may affect our relationship with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nChanges in our credit profile may affect the way our suppliers view our ability to make payments and may induce them to shorten the payment terms of their invoices. Given the large dollar amounts and volume of our purchases from suppliers, a change in payment terms may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers and, consequently, may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nAlthough we believe our current sales backlog, which consists of purchase orders or purchase commitments, and our qualified pipeline of carefully vetted potential sales opportunities, will translate into future revenue, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuit.\nAlthough we conduct a detailed due diligence investigation on our current and potential customers and place a heavy emphasis on the qualification process to ensure that all active customer purchase orders and commitments relating to our backlog and all active opportunities in our qualified pipeline have been meticulously vetted, the criteria we rely on and the internal analysis we undertake is subjective. Furthermore, we have a relatively short operating history and do not have significant data relating to the conversion of our backlog into revenue and the conversion of our qualified pipeline into customer contracts. Accordingly, although we believe that a portion of our backlog and qualified pipeline will translate into bookings over the next 12 months, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such pursuit. In the event our backlog and qualified pipeline do not translate into bookings as projected, it could materially and adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe rely on third parties for certain services made available to our customers, which could limit our control over the quality of the user experience and our cost of providing services.\nSome of the applications and services available through our proprietary Agrify cultivation solution, including our flagship hardware product, the Agrify Vertical Farming Unit (VFU), and our proprietary SaaS product, Agrify Insights\u2122, are provided through relationships with third party service providers. We do not typically have any direct control over these third-party service providers. These third-party service providers could experience service outages, data loss, privacy breaches, including cyber-attacks, and other events relating to the applications and services they provide that could diminish the utility of these services and which could harm users thereof. Our platform is currently hosted by a third-party service provider. There are readily available alternative hosting services available should we desire or need to move to a different web host. Certain ancillary services provided by us also uses the services of third-party providers, for which, we believe, there are readily available alternatives on comparable economic terms. Offering integrated platforms which rely, in part, on the services of other providers lessens the control that we have over the total client experience. Should the third-party service providers we rely upon not deliver at standards we expect and desire, acceptance of our platforms could suffer, which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Further, we cannot be assured of entering into agreements with such third-party service providers on economically favorable terms.\nThe growth and success of our business depends on the continued contributions of Raymond Chang, as our key executive officer, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur growth and success are dependent upon the continued contributions made by our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Raymond Chang. We rely on Mr. Changs expertise in business operations when we are developing new products and services. If Mr. Chang cannot serve us or is no longer willing to do so, we may not be able to find alternatives in a timely manner or at all. This may have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our growth and success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to identify, attract, hire, train and retain qualified professional, creative, technical and managerial personnel. Timothy R. Oakes, our Chief Financial Officer, notified us on January 2, 2023 that he intended to resign from his role with us effective as of February 28, 2023 to pursue other opportunities. While we are conducting a search for Mr. Oakes successor, there is no assurance that we will be able to identify, attract or hire a replacement in a timely manner. Competition for experience and qualified talent in the indoor agriculture marketplace can be intense. We may not be successful in identifying, attracting, hiring, training and retaining such personnel in the future. If we are unable to hire, assimilate and retain qualified personnel in the future, such inability could adversely affect our operations.\nWe face intense competition that could prohibit us from developing or increasing our customer base.\nThe indoor agriculture industry is highly competitive. We may compete with companies that have greater capital resources and facilities. More established companies with much greater financial resources which do not currently compete with us may be able to adapt their existing operations more easily to our line of business. In addition, the continued growth of the cannabis industry will likely attract some of these existing companies and incentivize them to produce solutions that are competitive with those offered by us. Our competitors may also introduce new and improved products, and manufacturers may sell equipment direct to consumers. We may not be able to successfully compete with larger enterprises devoting significant resources to compete in our target market space. Due to this competition, there is no assurance that we will not encounter difficulties in increasing revenues and maintaining and/or increasing market share. In addition, increased competition may lead to reduced prices and/or margins for products we sell.\nProtecting and defending against intellectual property claims may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon the successful protection of our intellectual property relating to our proprietary Agrify cultivation solution, including our flagship hardware product, the VFU, and our proprietary SaaS product, Agrify Insights\u2122. We seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights through patent applications, common law copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure agreements, and non-disclosure provisions within our licensing and distribution arrangements with reputable companies in our target markets. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights would be costly, and there can be no assurance that we will have the resources to undertake all necessary action to protect our intellectual property rights or that we will be successful. Any infringement of our material intellectual property rights could require us to redirect resources to actions necessary to protect same and could distract management from our underlying business operations. An infringement of our material intellectual property rights and resulting actions could adversely affect our operations.\nWe cannot assure investors that we will continue to innovate and file new patent applications, or that any current or future patent applications will result in granted patents. Further, we cannot predict how long it will take for such patents to issue, if at all. It is possible that, for any of our patents that may issue in the future, our competitors may design their products around our patented technologies. Further, we cannot assure investors that other parties will not challenge any patents granted to us, or that courts or regulatory agencies will hold our patents to be valid, enforceable, and/or infringed. We cannot guarantee investors that we will be successful in defending challenges made against our patents and patent applications. Any successful third-party challenge or challenges to our patents could result in the unenforceability or invalidity of such patents, or such patents being interpreted narrowly and/or in a manner adverse to our interests. Our ability to establish or maintain a technological or competitive advantage over our competitors and/or market entrants may be diminished because of these uncertainties. For these and other reasons, our intellectual property may not provide us with any competitive advantage. For example:\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to make the inventions claimed or disclosed in our patent application;\n\u25cf we may not have been the first to file patent application. To determine the priority of these inventions, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), which could result in substantial cost to us, and could possibly result in a loss or narrowing of patent rights. No assurance can be given that our granted patents will have priority over any other patent or patent application involved in such a proceeding, or will be held valid as an outcome of the proceeding;\n\u25cf other parties may independently develop similar or alternative products and technologies or duplicate any of our products and technologies, which can potentially impact our market share, revenue, and goodwill, regardless of\n\u25cf it is possible that our issued patents may not provide intellectual property protection of commercially viable products or product features, may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be challenged and invalidated by third parties, patent offices, and/or the courts;\n\u25cf we may be unaware of or unfamiliar with prior art and/or interpretations of prior art that could potentially impact the validity or scope of our patents or patent applications that we may file;\n\u25cf we take efforts and enter into agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, and advisors to confirm ownership and chain of title in intellectual property rights. However, an inventorship or ownership dispute could arise that may permit one or more third parties to practice or enforce our intellectual property rights, including possible efforts to enforce rights against us;\n\u25cf we may elect not to maintain or pursue intellectual property rights that, at some point in time, may be considered relevant to or enforceable against a competitor;\n\u25cf we may not develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are patentable, or we may develop additional proprietary products and technologies that are not patentable;\n\u25cf the patents or other intellectual property rights of others may have an adverse effect on our business; and\n\u25cf we apply for patents relating to our products and technologies and uses thereof, as we deem appropriate. However, we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents on important products and technologies in a timely fashion or at all, or we or our representatives or their agents may fail to apply for patents in potentially relevant jurisdictions.\nTo the extent our intellectual property offers inadequate protection, or is found to be invalid or unenforceable, we would be exposed to a greater risk of direct or indirect competition. If our intellectual property does not provide adequate coverage over our competitors products, our competitive position could be adversely affected, as could our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the U.S. and other countries, as well as contract provisions, license agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other contractual rights, as well as procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful in any given case. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breach of any contractual obligations to us, or independent development of intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affecting our revenues or otherwise harming our business.\nWe generally control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. copyright laws.\nDespite efforts to protect our proprietary rights through intellectual property laws, licenses, and confidentiality agreements, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and technology. Companies in the Internet, technology, and software industries frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or violations of intellectual property rights or other laws. From time to time, we may face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including competitors. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect these rights, any proceedings could be burdensome, costly and divert the attention of our personnel, and we may not prevail. In addition, any repeal or weakening of laws or enforcement in the U.S. or internationally intended to protect intellectual property rights could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, negatively impacting their value and increasing the cost of enforcing our rights.\nWe have obtained and applied for U.S. trademark and service mark registrations and will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks or, as appropriate. We cannot guarantee that any of our pending trademark applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, even if the trademark applications are approved, third parties may seek to oppose or otherwise challenge these registrations. A failure to obtain registrations for our trademarks could limit and impede our marketing efforts.\nWe may need to enter into intellectual property license agreements in the future, and if we are unable to obtain these licenses, our business could be harmed.\nWe may need or may choose to obtain licenses and/or acquire intellectual property rights from third parties to advance our research or commercialization of our current or future products. We also cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist that might be enforced against our current or future products in the absence of such a license or acquisition. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms. Even if we are able to obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to develop or license replacement technology. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected products, which could materially harm our business and the third parties owning such intellectual property rights could seek either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us.\nCompanies in the software and technology industries can own patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other violations of intellectual property or other rights. In addition, various non-practicing entities that own patents (colloquially known as patent trolls) often attempt to aggressively assert their rights to extract value from technology companies. It is possible that, from time to time, third parties may claim that our products misappropriate or infringe their intellectual property rights. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of any such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against these claims, which could adversely affect our operations. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the practices. The development of alternative non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial money damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another partys rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may significantly increase our operating expenses.\nOur ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes which may be available to offset taxable income in future years. Approximately $675 thousand of federal NOLs will expire if not utilized by 2037 and approximately $96.0 million of federal NOLs carryforward indefinitely but are only available to offset 80% of taxable income per year. The $71.6 million state NOLs will expire depending upon the various rules in the states in which we operate. A lack of future taxable income would adversely affect our ability to utilize these NOLs before they expire. The utilization of our NOLs could be subject to annual limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC or the Code) of 1986, and similar state tax provisions due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. In general, under Section 382, a corporation that undergoes an ownership change (as defined under Section 382 of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations) is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOLs to offset its future taxable income. As of December 31, 2022, we have not conducted an analysis of an ownership change under Section 382. To the extent that a study is completed, and an ownership change is deemed to occur, in the past or future, our NOLs and any NOLs of companies that we have acquired could be limited to offset any future taxable income.\nThere is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities for federal and state income tax purposes. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs, even if we attain profitability, which could result in increased future tax liability to us and could adversely affect the results of our operations and overall financial condition.\nThere are no assurances that our outstanding loans will be forgivable in whole or in part.\nIn May 2020, we entered into a Loan Agreement and Promissory Note with Bank of America pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). We received total proceeds of approximately $779 thousand from the unsecured PPP loan which was originally scheduled to mature in May 2022. We applied for forgiveness on the $779 thousand of our PPP loan, but forgiveness was denied by the SBA. On June 23, 2022, we received a letter from Bank of America agreeing to extend the maturity date to May 7, 2025 with interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. The PPP loan is payable in 34 equal combined monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $24 thousand that commenced on August 7, 2022.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nOur executive officers, directors and their affiliates beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately 10.54% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. In particular, Raymond Chang, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owns approximately 9.99% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our articles of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.\nThe large number of shares eligible for public sale could depress the market price of our Common Stock.\nWe have filed a registration statement to register the shares of Common Stock underlying outstanding options and shares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. Upon effectiveness of that registration statement, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and subject to our insider trading policy, the shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the U.S. in the open market.\nSales of our Common Stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Common Stock.\nOur failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a de-listing of our Common Stock.\nIf we fail to continue to satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, such as the corporate governance requirements or the minimum closing bid price requirement, Nasdaq will take steps to delist our Common Stock. Such a de-listing would likely have a negative effect on the price of our Common Stock and would impair stockholders ability to sell or purchase our Common Stock when they wish to do so, as well as adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future.\nOn January 19, 2023, we received a new deficiency letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of our Common Stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G). On July 19, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq confirming our compliance with the minimum bid price rule.\nOn April 18, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq (the April Nasdaq Notice) that we were noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn May 17, 2023, we received a second notice from Nasdaq (the May Nasdaq Notice) that we remained noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (the First Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn August 16, 2023, we received a third notice from Nasdaq that we remain noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 (the Second Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required filing date (the August Nasdaq Notice and, together with the April Nasdaq Notice and the May Nasdaq Notice, the Nasdaq Notices).\nOn October 17, 2023, we received a Staff Delisting Determination (the Staff Determination) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaqs continued listing requirements under the Listing Rule as a result of our failure to file the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K (collectively, the Delinquent Reports) in a timely manner. The Staff Determination has no immediate effect and will not immediately result in the suspension of trading or delisting of our shares of common stock.\nWe timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel), and the Panel scheduled a hearing for January 11, 2024. In connection with the hearing request, we requested that the stay be extended through the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has granted this additional extension period. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance by the end of any additional extension period.\nAs disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 17, 2023, our audit committee concluded that, as a result of inadvertent errors in the accounting for warrants previously issued by us, it was appropriate to restate our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 included in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods in amended quarterly reports for the affected periods. As a result of such restatements, we were unable to timely file the Form 10-K, the First Quarter Form 10-Q and the Second Quarter Form 10-Q without unreasonable effort or expense.\nWe will take all possible actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq, but we can provide no assurances that the listing of our Common Stock will be restored or that we otherwise will remain listed on Nasdaq.\nThe exercise of all or any number of outstanding warrants or the issuance of stock-based awards may dilute your holding of shares of our Common Stock.\nWe have issued several securities providing for the right to purchase our common stock. Investors could be subject to increased dilution upon the exercise of our warrants. A total of 1,495,011 warrants were issued and outstanding as of October 1, 2023.\nAdditionally, 9,354 shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance of currently outstanding equity-based awards to employees, directors and certain other individuals under the Companys 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. The exercise of equity awards, including any restricted stock units that we may grant in the future, and the exercise of warrants and the subsequent sale of shares of Common Stock issued thereby, could have an adverse effect on the market for our Common Stock, including the price that an investor could obtain for their shares.\nInvestors may experience dilution in the value of their investment upon the exercise of the warrants and any equity awards that may be granted or issued pursuant to the 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Nevada law might discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our Common Stock.\nProvisions of our articles of incorporation, our by-laws and Nevada law may have the effect of deterring unsolicited takeovers or delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or changes in our management, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices. In addition, these provisions may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests. These provisions include:\n\u25cf the inability of stockholders to call special meetings; and\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could include the right to approve an acquisition or other change in our control or could be used to institute a rights plan, also known as a poison pill, that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, likely preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors.\nThe existence of the forgoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Common Stock in an acquisition.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act, and a smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies or smaller reporting companies will make our Common Stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. For as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including (1) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (2) reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in this report and our periodic reports and proxy statements and (3) exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, as an emerging growth company, we are only required to provide two years of audited consolidated financial statements and two years of selected financial data in this report. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any March 31 before that time or if we have total annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more during any fiscal year before that time, after which, in each case, we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31 or, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during any three-year period before that time, we would cease to be an emerging growth company immediately.\nAdditionally, we are a smaller reporting company as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited consolidated financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares of Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosure obligations, it may also make comparison of our consolidated financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible.\nAfter we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional management time and cost to comply with the more stringent reporting requirements applicable to companies that are deemed accelerated filers or large accelerated filers, including complying with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs.\nWe have not and do not expect to declare any dividends to our shareholders in the foreseeable future.\nWe have not and do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their Common Stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our Common Stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to mitigate its impact may have an adverse effect on our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and price of our securities.\nThe pandemic involving the novel strain of coronavirus and related respiratory disease (which we refer to as COVID-19) and the measures taken to combat it, have had an adverse effect on our business. Public health authorities and governments at local, national and international levels have announced various measures to respond to this pandemic. Some measures that directly or indirectly impact our business include:\n\u25cf voluntary or mandatory quarantines;\n\u25cf restrictions on travel; and\n\u25cf limiting gatherings of people in public places.\nWe have undertaken measures in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 including limiting company travel and in-person meetings. We also have enacted our business continuity plans, including implementing procedures requiring employees working remotely where possible which may make maintaining our normal level of corporate operations, quality controls and internal controls difficult. Notwithstanding these efforts, our results of operations have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 and this may continue.\nMoreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has previously caused some temporary delays in the delivery of our inventory, although recently we are no longer experiencing such delays. In addition, the travel restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19 have impacted our ability to visit customer sites to perform services related to our products. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation efforts have also adversely affected our customers financial condition, resulting in reduced spending for the products we sell.\nAs events are rapidly changing, we do not know how long the COVID-19 pandemic, or localized outbreaks or recurrences of COVID-19, and the measures that have been introduced to respond to COVID-19 will disrupt our operations or the full extent of that disruption. Further, once we are able to restart normal operations doing so may take time and will involve costs and uncertainty. We also cannot predict how long the effects of COVID-19 and the efforts to contain it will continue to impact our business after the pandemic is under control. Governments could take additional restrictive measures to combat the pandemic that could further impact our business or the economy in the geographies in which we operate. It is also possible that the impact of the pandemic and response on our suppliers, customers and markets will persist for some time after governments ease their restrictions. These measures have negatively impacted, and may continue to impact, our business and financial condition as the responses to control COVID-19 continue.\nA prolonged economic downturn, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business.\nUncertain global economic conditions, in particular in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our business. Negative global and national economic trends, such as decreased consumer and business spending, high unemployment levels and declining consumer and business confidence, pose challenges to our business and could result in declining revenues, profitability and cash flow. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands, unfavorable economic conditions may negatively affect demand for our products.\nIncreases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials could harm our business.\nWe may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. For example, the tariffs currently imposed for importing goods from China has significantly increased. Any such an increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased prices for our products and services.\nMatters relating to the employment market and prevailing wage standards may adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to meet our labor needs on a cost-effective basis is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of qualified personnel in the workforce in the markets in which we operate, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, which have increased significantly, health and other insurance costs and changes in employment and labor laws. In the event prevailing wage rates continue to increase in the markets in which we operate, we may be required to concurrently increase the wages paid to our employees to maintain the quality of our workforce. To the extent such increases are not offset by price increases, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and reputation may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, we rely on the ability to attract and retain employees on a cost-effective basis. The availability of employees in the markets in which we operate has declined in recent years and competition for such personnel has increased, especially under the economic crises experienced throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ability to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis depends on several factors, including the ability to protect staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. We may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient workforce on a cost-effective basis in the future. In the event of increased costs of attracting and retaining a workforce, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nLitigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time in the normal course of our business operations, we may become subject to litigation involving intellectual property, data privacy and security, consumer protection, commercial disputes and other matters that may negatively affect our operating results if changes to our business operation are required. Due to our manufacturing and sale of our products, including hardware and software, we may also be subject to a variety of claims including product warranty, product liability, and consumer protection claims related to product defects, among other litigation. We may also be subject to claims involving health and safety, hazardous materials usage, other environmental impacts, or service disruptions or failures. The cost to defend such litigation may be significant and may require a diversion of our resources. There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could negatively affect customer perception of our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, insurance may not cover existing or future claims, be sufficient to fully compensate us for one or more of such claims or continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. A claim brought against us that is uninsured or underinsured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations and resulting in a reduction in the trading price of our stock.\nAn active, liquid, and orderly trading market for our Common Stock may not develop, the price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, which include:\n\u25cf whether we achieve our anticipated corporate objectives;\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u25cf changes in our financial or operational estimates or projections;\n\u25cf our ability to implement our operational plans;\n\u25cf termination of the lock-up agreement or other restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to sell shares;\n\u25cf changes in the economic performance or market valuations of companies similar to ours; and\n\u25cf general economic or political conditions in the U.S. or elsewhere.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources.\nWe incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or (SEC), and Nasdaq. In addition, our management team also has to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. We expect complying with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert our managements attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nAs a public company, we also expect that it may be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.\nAs a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. These internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our Common Stock.\nWe are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to annually furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment includes disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls.\nWe are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing the documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to remediate future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our Common Stock.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate these material weaknesses, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately or timely requirements applicable to public companies, which may adversely affect investor confidence in us, and, as a result, the market price of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our management is likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and material weaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs described elsewhere in this Report, we have identified the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf inability to close timely;\n\u25cf lack of technical expertise; and\n\u25cf accounting for complex financial instruments.\nAs a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022.\nTo respond to these material weaknesses, we have devoted, and plan to continue to devote, significant effort and resources to the remediation and improvement of our internal control over financial reporting. Our plans currently include rebuild of the internal finance function and engagement of external financial consultants. The elements of our remediation plan can only be accomplished over time, and we can offer no assurance that these initiatives will ultimately have the intended effects.\nAny failure to maintain such internal control could adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our consolidated financial statements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our consolidated financial statements are not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock.\nWe can give no assurance that the measures we have taken and plan to take in the future will remediate the material weaknesses identified or that any additional material weaknesses or restatements of financial results will not arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, in the future those controls, and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or errors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our consolidated financial statements.\nData privacy and security concerns relating to our technology and our practices could damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant liability, and deter current and potential users or customers from using our products and services. Software bugs or defects, security breaches, and attacks on our systems could result in the improper disclosure and use of user data and interference with our users and customers ability to use our products and services, harming our business operations and reputation.\nConcerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other data-privacy-related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Our policies and practices may change over time as expectations regarding privacy and data change. Our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information, and bugs, theft, misuse, defects, vulnerabilities in our products and services, and security breaches expose us to a risk of loss of this information, improper use and disclosure of such information, litigation, and other potential liability. Systems and control failures, security breaches and/or inadvertent disclosure of user data could result in government and legal exposure, seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability to attract and retain customers.\nWe may experience cyber-attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access to our systems. We may experience future security issues, whether due to employee error or malfeasance or system errors or vulnerabilities in our or other parties systems, which could result in significant legal and financial exposure. We may be unable to anticipate or detect attacks or vulnerabilities or implement adequate preventative measures. Attacks and security issues could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information, harming our business. As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial exposure, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nOur operations may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.\nWe rely on information technology systems to conduct business, including communicating with employees and our key commercial customers, ordering and managing materials from suppliers, shipping products and providing SaaS services to our customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, our systems may nevertheless be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users. If our information technology systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber incident or otherwise, our ability to communicate internally as well as with our customers could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of our business, we collect, store and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our customers, employees, suppliers and others, including personally identifiable information. An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our employees or customers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We also may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training, and third-party consultants. The losses incurred from a breach of data security and operational failures as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nPrivacy regulation is an evolving area and compliance with applicable privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely impact our ability to service our clients and market our products and services.\nBecause we store, process, and use data, some of which contains personal information, we are subject to complex and evolving federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. While we believe we are currently in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and uncertain interpretation, and could result in investigations, claims, changes to our business practices, increased cost of operations, and declines in user growth, retention, or engagement, any of which could seriously harm our business.\nIf our shares of Common Stock become subject to the penny stock rules, it would become more difficult to trade our shares.\nThe SEC has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or authorized for quotation on certain automated quotation systems, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system. If we do not retain a listing on Nasdaq and if the price of our Common Stock is less than $5.00, our Common Stock will be deemed a penny stock. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, before a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document containing specified information. In addition, the penny stock rules require that before effecting any transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, a broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive (i) the purchasers written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement; (ii) a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks; and (iii) a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our Common Stock, and therefore stockholders may have difficulty selling their shares.\nThe financial and operational projections that we may make from time to time are subject to inherent risks.\nThe projections that our management may provide from time to time (including, but not limited to, those relating to potential peak sales amounts, production, and supply dates, and other financial or operational matters) reflect numerous assumptions made by management, including assumptions with respect to our specific as well as general business, economic, market and financial conditions and other matters, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Accordingly, there is a risk that the assumptions made in preparing the projections, or the projections themselves, will prove inaccurate. There will be differences between actual and projected results, and actual results may be materially different from those contained in the projections. The inclusion of the projections in this report should not be regarded as an indication that we or our management or representatives considered or consider the projections to be a reliable prediction of future events, and the projections should not be relied upon as such.\nIf we were to dissolve, the holders of our securities may lose all or substantial amounts of their investments.\nIf we were to dissolve as a corporation, as part of ceasing to do business or otherwise, we may be required to pay all amounts owed to any creditors before distributing any assets to the investors. There is a risk that in the event of such a dissolution, there will be insufficient funds to repay amounts owed to holders of any of our indebtedness and insufficient assets to distribute to our other investors, in which case investors could lose their entire investment.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Common Stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur corporate headquarters is in Troy, Michigan where we occupy approximately 15,825 square feet of office, warehousing, and light industrial space under a lease that expires in 2026. We lease properties located within various geographic regions in which we conduct business, including Colorado, Georgia, and Michigan. Our properties include office spaces, showrooms, and warehouses used for research and development, operational, sales, management, and administrative purposes. All of our facilities are leased.\nWe believe our facilities are adequate for our needs and believe that we should be able to renew any of our existing leases or secure similar property without an adverse impact on our operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nFrom time to time, we are a party to various legal proceedings or claims arising in the ordinary course of business. For information related to significant legal proceedings in which we are involved, see the discussion under the caption Legal Matters in Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 19 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K, which information is incorporated by reference into this Item 3. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol AGFY.\nHolders of Record\nAs of October 1, 2023, there were 58 holders of record of our Common Stock. Such numbers do not include beneficial owners holding shares of our Common Stock in nominee or street name through various brokerage firms.\nDividends\nWe have never paid cash dividends on any of our capital stock and currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance under Equity Compensation Plans\nFor information concerning our equity compensation plan, see Part III, Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity Repurchases\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThe following summarizes all issuances of our unregistered securities during the year ended December 31, 2022 that were not previously disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K or Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The securities in the below-referenced transactions were (i) issued without registration and (ii) were subject to restrictions under the Securities Act and the securities laws of certain states, in reliance on the private offering exemptions contained in Sections 4(2), 4(6) and/or 3(b) of the Securities Act and on Regulation D promulgated there under, and in reliance on similar exemptions under applicable state laws as transactions not involving a public offering. No placement or underwriting fees were paid in connection with these transactions.\nOn August 17, 2022, we issued 435 shares of Common Stock for contingent liabilities to the former holders of Precision and Cascade in connection with the acquisition of Precision and Cascade. Item 6. [Reserved].\nNot applicable. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations, whose actual outcomes involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those stated in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in the sections entitled Risk Factors, Cautionary Statement regarding Forward-Looking Statements and elsewhere in this report.\nOverview\nWe are one of the most innovative providers of advanced cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis industry, bringing data, science, and technology to the forefront of the market. Our proprietary micro-environment-controlled Agrify Vertical Farming Units (or VFUs) enable cultivators to produce the highest quality products with what we believe to be an unmatched consistency, yield, and Return on Investment at scale. Our comprehensive extraction product line, which includes hydrocarbon, ethanol, solventless, post-processing, and lab equipment, empowers producers to maximize the quantity and quality of extract required for premium concentrates.\nOur cultivation and extraction solutions seamlessly combine our integrated hardware and software offerings with a broad range of associated services including consulting, engineering, and construction and are designed to deliver the most complete commercial indoor farming solution available from a single provider. The totality of our product offerings and service capabilities forms an unrivaled ecosystem in what has historically been a highly fragmented market. As a result, we believe we are well situated to create a dominant market position in the indoor agriculture sector.\nAgrify Corporation was incorporated in the state of Nevada on June 6, 2016, originally incorporated as Agrinamics, Inc. (or Agrinamics). On September 16, 2019, Agrinamics amended its articles of incorporation to reflect a name change to Agrify Corporation.\nOur corporate headquarters are located in Troy, Michigan. We also lease properties located within various geographic regions in which we conduct business, including Colorado, Georgia and Michigan.\nReverse Stock Splits\nOn January 12, 2021, we effected a 1-for-1.581804 reverse stock split on our Common Stock.\nOn October 18, 2022, we effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split on our Common Stock.\nOn July 5th, 2023, we effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split on our Common Stock. All share and per information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock splits for all periods presented, unless otherwise indicated.\nRecent Business Developments\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 25, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Agreement) with an institutional investor and other accredited investors for the sale of 12,253 shares (the SA Shares) of our Common Stock, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants) to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,853 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,079 shares of Common Stock (the Common Warrants and, collectively with the Pre-Funded Warrants, the SA Warrants), in a private placement offering. The combined purchase price for one share of Common Stock (or one Pre-Funded Warrant) and the accompanying fraction of a Common Warrant was $1,360.00 per share.\nSubject to certain ownership limitations, the SA Warrants became exercisable six months from issuance. Each Pre-Funded Warrant is exercisable into one share of Common Stock (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof). Each Common Warrant is exercisable into one share of Common Stock at a price per share of $1,496.00 (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof) and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the initial exercise date. The institutional investor that received the Pre-Funded Warrants fully exercised such warrants in March 2022.\nRaymond Chang, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and Stuart Wilcox, who previously served as our Chief Operating Officer, and at the time was a member of our Board of Directors, participated in the private placement on essentially the same terms as other investors, except for having a combined purchase price of $1,380.00 per share.\nThe gross proceeds to us from the private placement were approximately $27.3 million, before deducting the placement agents fees and other offering expenses.\nAcquisition of Lab Society\nOn February 1, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with LS Holdings Corp. (Lab Society), Lab Society NewCo, LLC, a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of us (Merger Sub), Michael S. Maibach Jr. as the Owner Representative thereunder, and each of the shareholders of Lab Society (collectively, the Owners), pursuant to which we agreed to acquire Lab Society. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we consummated the merger of Lab Society with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of us (the Lab Society Acquisition).\nThe aggregate consideration for the Lab Society Acquisition consisted of $4.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for working capital, cash and indebtedness of Lab Society at closing; 2,128 shares of Common Stock (the Buyer Shares); and the Earn-out Consideration (as defined below), to the extent earned.\nWe withheld 638 of the Buyer Shares issuable to the Owners (the Holdback Lab Buyer Shares) for the purpose of securing any post-closing adjustment owed to us and any claim for indemnification or payment of damages to which we may be entitled under the Merger Agreement. During the third quarter of 2022, 139 of the Holdback Lab Buyer Shares were forfeited after the finalization of the net working capital settlement. The remaining 499 Holdback Lab Buyer Shares were released following the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement. Additional information regarding our contingent consideration arrangements may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary post-closing adjustments, representations, and warranties and covenants of the parties. The Owners may become entitled to additional consideration with a value of up to $3.5 million based on the eligible net revenues achieved by the Lab Society business during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2023, of which 50% will be payable in cash and the remaining 50% will be payable by issuing shares of Common Stock.\nBased upon the combined first and second-quarter actual revenue performance, Lab Societys revenue trend is significantly below the originally estimated revenue trends incorporated into our original fair value estimates at the time of the acquisition. We have concluded Lab Society will not achieve any contingent earn-out consideration in connection with its first earn-out period. Accordingly, we reversed the current accrued contingent consideration liability associated with Lab Societys first earn-out period as of September 30, 2022. The reversal of this liability of approximately $1.0 million, as required by Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 805 Business Combination (ASC 805), was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses during the second quarter of 2022.\nThe purchase price allocation for the business combination has been prepared on a preliminary basis and changes to those allocations may occur as additional information becomes available during the respective measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date). The estimated fair value at acquisition is $7.9 million and may be adjusted upon further review of the values assigned to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill.\n\u202f\nOur initial fair value estimates related to the various identified intangible assets were determined under various valuation approaches including the Income Approach, Relief-from-Royalty Method, and Discounted Cash Flow Method. These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted-average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.\nDuring the three-month ended June 30, 2022, we identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in our stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, we deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of our property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022. Based on our interim testing, we noted that the entire carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets should be impaired. Additional information regarding our interim testing on goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn March 14, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement) with an accredited investor (the Investor), we agreed to issue and sell to the Investor, in a private placement transaction, in exchange for the payment by the Investor of $65 million, less applicable expenses as set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement, a senior secured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of $65 million (the SPA Note), and a warrant (the SPA Warrant) to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock.\nAugust 2022 Securities Exchange Agreement\nOn August 18, 2022, we reached an agreement with the Investor to amend its existing SPA Note and entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the August 2022 Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, we partially paid $35.2 million along with approximately $300 thousand in repayments for other fees under the SPA Note and exchanged the remaining balance of the SPA Note for a the Exchange Note with an aggregate original principal amount of $35.0 million and a new warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock (the Note Exchange Warrant). Additionally, we exchanged the SPA Warrant for a new warrant for the same number of underlying shares but with a reduced exercise price (the Modified Warrant and, collectively with the Note Exchange Warrant, the August 2022 Warrants). Additional information regarding our August 2022 Warrants may be found in Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.\nThe Exchange Note is a senior secured obligation of ours and ranks senior to all indebtedness of ours. The Exchange Note will mature on the three-year anniversary of its issuance (the Maturity Date) and contains a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash, beginning September 1, 2022. The principal amount of the Exchange Note will be payable on the Maturity Date, provided that the holder will be entitled to a cash sweep of 20% of the proceeds received by us in connection with any equity financing, which will reduce the outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note.\nAt any time, we may prepay all of the Exchange Note by redemption at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Note plus accrued but unpaid interest. The holder will also have the option of requiring us to redeem the Exchange Note on the one-year or two-year anniversaries of issuance at a price equal to the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest, or if we undergo a fundamental change at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest.\nThe Exchange Note imposes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon us, as well as covenants that restrict us and our subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our subsidiaries from making certain investments, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions, requires us not to exceed maximum levels of allowable cash spend while the Exchange Note is outstanding, and requires us to maintain minimum amounts of cash on hand. If an event of default under the Exchange Note occurs, the holder can elect to redeem the Exchange Note for cash equal to 115% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Note (or such lesser principal amount accelerated by the holder), plus accrued and unpaid interest, including default interest, which accrues at a rate per year equal to 15% from the date of a default or event of default.\nUntil the date the Exchange Note is fully repaid, the holder has, subject to certain exceptions, the right to participate for up to 30% of any offering of debt, equity (other than an offering of solely Common Stock), or equity-linked securities, including without limitation any debt, preferred stock or other instrument or security, of us or our subsidiaries.\nThe Modified Warrant has an exercise price of $430.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions, will be exercisable on and after the six-month anniversary of issuance, has a term of five and one-half years from the date of issuance and will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Modified Warrant (the Modified Warrant Shares), in which case the Modified Warrant will also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis at the holders election.\nThe Note Exchange Warrant has an exercise price of $246.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends and similar transactions, was exercisable upon issuance, and has a term of five and one-half years from the date of issuance and is exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant (the Note Exchange Warrant Shares and, together with the Modified Warrant Shares, the Exchange Warrant Shares), in which case the Note Exchange Warrant will also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis at the holders election. Until we completed a qualified equity financing of at least $15.0 million, which requirement was satisfied with sales under the at-the-market continuous equity offering (ATM or ATM Program), the Note Exchange Warrants exercise price would have been reduced to the extent we issued securities for a lower purchase price. The Note Exchange Warrant also prohibited us, until following the completion of such qualified equity financing, from issuing warrants with more favorable or preferential terms and/or provisions.\nThe August 2022 Warrants each provide that in no event will the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of such warrants result in the holders beneficial ownership exceeding 4.99% of our shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of exercise (which percentage may be decreased or increased by the holder, but to no greater than 9.99%). Additionally, the August 2022 Warrants could not be exercised for more than an aggregate of 26,542 shares of Common Stock unless and until shareholder approval is obtained, which approval was obtained on October 14, 2022.\nMarch 2023 Securities Exchange Agreement\nOn March 8, 2023, we entered into a second Securities Exchange Agreement with the Investor (the March 2023 Exchange Agreement), pursuant to which we prepaid approximately $10.3 million in principal under the Exchange Note and exchanged $10.0 million in principal amount under the Exchange Note for a new senior convertible note (the Convertible Note and, together with the Exchange Note, the Notes) with an original principal amount of $10.0 million. The Convertible Note will mature on August 19, 2025. We also amended the Exchange Note to remove covenants regarding minimum cash spend and cash on hand.\nAt The Marketing Offering\nOn October 18, 2022, we entered into the ATM Program with Canaccord Genuity LLC (the Agent) pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, depending on market demand, with the Agent acting as an agent for sales. The ATM Program allowed us to sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to specific parameters defined by us as well as those defined by the SEC and the ATM Program agreement. Beginning October 18, 2022 through December 31, 2022, we sold 306,628 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $50.85, resulting in gross proceeds of $15.6 million and net proceeds of $15.1 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $468 thousand. Subsequent to December 31, 2022 through April 1, 2023, after which time the ATM program was discontinued, we sold an additional 323,082 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $4.93, resulting in gross proceeds of $1.6 million and net proceeds of $1.6 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $48 thousand. For the entire period from October 18, 2022 through April 1, 2023, we sold 629,710 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $27.29 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $17.2 million, and net proceeds of $16.7 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $516 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the Investor under the Exchange Note. We used the net proceeds generated from the ATM Program for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding its transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts and capital expenditures.\nConfidentially Marketed Public Offering\nOn December 16, 2022, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Canaccord Genuity LLC as the underwriter, pursuant to which we agreed to sell an aggregate of 594,232 shares of our Common Stock, and, in lieu of Common Stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants) to purchase 75,000 shares of our Common Stock, and accompanying warrants (the December 2022 Warrants) to purchase 1,338,462 shares of our Common Stock (the Offering). The combined public offering price for each share of Common Stock and accompanying two warrants was $13.00 per share, and the combined offering price for each Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying two warrants was $12.98 per share.\nThe December 2022 Warrants may not be exercised by the holder to the extent that the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own, after such exercise more than 4.99% of the shares of our Common Stock then outstanding (subject to the right of the holder to increase or decrease such beneficial ownership limitation upon notice to us, provided that such limitation cannot exceed 9.99%).\nThe Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants were classified as a component of permanent equity and the December 2022 Warrants were liability-classified and were recorded at the issuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. The Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants are equity-classified because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, are immediately exercisable, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise. In addition, such warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The December 2022 Warrants are liability-classified as there is a volatility floor and these warrants are not indexed to our Common Stock.\nRaymond Chang, our Chairman and CEO, participated in the Offering and purchased 115,385 shares of Common Stock and 230,769 warrants for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 million.\nWe received aggregate gross proceeds to us from the Offering of approximately $8.7 million including offering costs of approximately $0.5 million for broker fees and legal expenses, for net proceeds of $8.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Offering, together with its existing cash resources, for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and repayment of debt.\nImpact of coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19)\nThe extensive impact of the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has resulted and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. In an effort to halt the outbreak of COVID-19, a number of countries, states, counties, and other jurisdictions have imposed, and may impose in the future, various measures, including but not limited to, voluntary and mandatory quarantines, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, limitations on gatherings of people, reduced operations, and extended closures of businesses.\nTo date, although all of our operations are functioning, COVID-19 has continued to cause some disruptions to our business, such as some temporary delays in the delivery of our inventory. Although the ability of our suppliers to timely ship their goods has affected some of our deliveries, currently the difficulties experienced by our suppliers have not yet materially impacted our ability to deliver products to our customers. However, if this continues, it may negatively affect any inventory we may have and more significantly delay the delivery of merchandise to our customers, which in turn will adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 and the related global economic crisis, affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties (including new financial regulation and other regulatory reform) in response to the pandemic, and the effects on our produce, clients, vendors and employees. We continue to service our customers amid uncertainty and disruption linked to COVID-19 and we are actively managing our business to respond to its impact.\nNasdaq Deficiency Notices\nOn October 4, 2022, we received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff) of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (Nasdaq) notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of our Common Stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G). On October 28, 2022, the Staff notified us that the closing bid price of our Common Stock was more than $1.00 for 10 consecutive trading days, and that we therefore regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.\nOn January 19, 2023, we received a new deficiency letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for our Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain a continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the Minimum Bid Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of our Common Stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G). On July 19, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq confirming our recompliance with the minimum bid price rule.\nOn April 18, 2023, we received a notice from Nasdaq (the April Nasdaq Notice) that we were noncompliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn May 17, 2023, we received a second notice from Nasdaq (the May Nasdaq Notice) that we remained noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (the First Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn August 16, 2023, we received a third notice from Nasdaq that we remain noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of our failure to file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 (the Second Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required filing date (the August Nasdaq Notice and, together with the April Nasdaq Notice and the May Nasdaq Notice, the Nasdaq Notices).\nOn October 17, 2023, we received a Staff Delisting Determination (the Staff Determination) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying us that we were not in compliance with Nasdaqs continued listing requirements under the Listing Rule as a result of our failure to file the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K (collectively, the Delinquent Reports) in a timely manner. The Staff Determination has no immediate effect and will not immediately result in the suspension of trading or delisting of our shares of common stock.\nWe timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel), and the Panel scheduled a hearing for January 11, 2024. In connection with the hearing request, we requested that the stay be extended through the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel has granted this additional extension period. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to regain compliance by the end of any additional extension period.\nAs disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 17, 2023, our audit committee concluded that, as a result of inadvertent errors in the accounting for warrants previously issued by us, it was appropriate to restate our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods in amended quarterly reports for the affected periods. As a result of such restatements, we were unable to timely file the Form 10-K, the First Quarter Form 10-Q and the Second Quarter Form 10-Q without unreasonable effort or expense.\nMack Molding Modification Agreement\nOn October 27, 2023, and with an effective date as of October 18, 2023, we entered into a Modification and Settlement Agreement (the Modification Agreement) with Mack Molding Company (Mack). Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, we agreed to settle an outstanding dispute with Mack under the Supply Agreement between the parties dated December 7, 2020 (the Supply Agreement). The Modification Agreement requires us to make payments of $500,000 and $250,000 to Mack on or before November 1, 2023 and February 15, 2024, respectively. Following the November 1, 2023 payment, we will be entitled to take possession of certain Vertical Farming Units (VFUs) that were assembled under the Supply Agreement. The Modification Agreement also requires us to purchase from Mack a minimum of 25 VFUs per quarter for each quarter during 2024 and a minimum of 50 VFUs per quarter for the six quarters beginning with the first quarter of 2025. We are required to pay a storage fee of $25,000 per month for VFUs subject to the Modification Agreement.\nAdditionally, as part of the Modification Agreement, we agreed to issue to Mack a warrant to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock. The warrant has an exercise price of $4.00 per share, was exercisable upon issuance, has a term of three years from the date of issuance, and is exercisable on a cash basis unless at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement for the resale of the underlying shares, in which case the warrant may be exercised on a cashless exercise basis at Macks election.\nWarrant Issuance\nOn October 27, 2023, we entered into a letter agreement with the Investor. Pursuant to the agreement, we agreed to exchange $3.0 million in principal and approximately $1.1 million in accrued but unpaid interest outstanding under the Exchange Note to purchase 2,809,669 shares of common stock (the Exchange Warrant). Additionally, we agreed to exchange the 375,629 shares of common stock held in abeyance for the lender under the terms of a letter agreement between us and the Investor dated April 26, 2023 for a warrant to purchase 375,629 shares of common stock (the Abeyance Warrant).\nEach warrant has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, was exercisable upon issuance, has a term of five years from the date of issuance and is exercisable on a cash basis or on a cashless exercise basis at the holders election.\nThe Exchange Warrant provides that in the event that Raymond Chang or his affiliates acquire securities from us, exercise convertible securities or amend the terms of convertible securities at a purchase or conversion price lower than $1.46, then the number of shares of common stock underlying Exchange Warrant will be increased to an amount equal to $3.0 million divided by such purchase or conversion price, subject to proportional adjustment in the event the Exchange Warrant has been partially exercised. Additionally, in the event that we have not issued equity securities in exchange for gross proceeds of at least $3.0 million to Mr. Chang or his affiliates (subject to certain offsets) by the third calendar day after the date when we receive stockholder approval, then on December 26, 2023, the number of shares of common stock underlying Exchange Warrant will be increased to an amount equal to $3.0 million divided by the Minimum Price as defined under Nasdaq listing rules, subject to proportional adjustment in the event the Exchange Warrant has been partially exercised.\nThe Letter Agreement requires us to issue equity securities to Mr. Chang or his affiliates for aggregate gross proceeds of at least $3.0 million, minus any funds advanced by Mr. Chang to us since July 1, 2023.\nNote Purchase\nOn October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC (the New Lender), an entity affiliated with and controlled by Raymond Chang, our Chief Executive Officer, purchased the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note from the Investor. In connection with the Note Purchase, the New Lender has agreed to waive any events of default under the acquired notes through December 31, 2023 and to enter into an agreement with us to extend the maturity date thereon to December 31, 2025.\nNote Amendment and Secured Promissory Note\nOn July 12, 2023, we issued an unsecured promissory note (the Note) in favor of GIC Acquisition, LLC (GIC), an entity that is managed by Raymond Chang, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, with an original principal amount of up to $500,000. On October 27, 2023, we and GIC amended and restated the Note (the Restated Note). Pursuant to the terms of the Restated Note, the Maturity Date was extended until December 31, 2023 and we granted a security interest in our assets that ranks junior to the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note.\nConcurrently with the Restated Note, we issued a junior secured promissory note (the Junior Secured Note) to the New Lender. Pursuant to the Junior Secured Note, the New Lender will lend up to $3,000,000 to us. The Junior Secured Note bears interest at a rate of 10% per annum, will mature in full on December 31, 2023, and may be prepaid without any fee or penalty. The Junior Secured Note is a secured obligation that ranks junior to the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts and notes receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the valuation of inventory, and useful life of fixed assets and intangible assets.\nFinancial Overview\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur managements discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates, which include estimates related to accruals, stock-based compensation expense, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience and other market-specific or other relevant assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates or assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nWe generate revenue from the following sources: (1) equipment sales, (2) providing services and (3) construction contracts.\nIn accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition, we recognize revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:\n\u25cf identify the customer contract;\n\u25cf identify performance obligations that are distinct;\n\u25cf determine the transaction price;\n\u25cf allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and\n\u25cf recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both us and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability, and consideration is probable. Specifically, we obtain written/electronic signatures on contracts and a purchase order, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise by us to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and our promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.\nAllocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. Our contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, for which we account for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific piece of equipment or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\nSignificant Judgments\nWe enter into contracts that may include various combinations of equipment, services and construction, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once we determine the performance obligations, it determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. We then allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on the SSP. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We determine SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and the methods of estimating SSP under the guidance of ASC 606-10-32-33. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the SSP, considering available information such as market conditions, expected margins, and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. We license our software as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) type subscription license, whereby the customer only has a right to access the software over a specified time period. The full value of the contract is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the SaaS subscription, adjusted monthly if tiered pricing is relevant. We typically satisfy our performance obligations for equipment sales when equipment is made available for shipment to the customer; for services sales as services are rendered to the customer and for construction contracts both as services are rendered and when contract is completed.\nWe utilize the cost-plus margin method to determine the SSP for equipment and build-out services. This method is based on the cost of the services from third parties, plus a reasonable markup that we believe is reflective of a market-based reseller margin.\nWe determine the SSP for services in time and materials contracts by observable prices in standalone services arrangements.\nWe estimate variable consideration in the form of royalties, revenue share, monthly fees, and service credits are estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Variable consideration is typically not subject to constraint. Changes to variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nIf a contract has payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, we will assess whether the transaction price for those contracts includes a significant financing component. We have elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if we expect that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one-year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. Accordingly, we impute interest on such contracts at an agreed-upon interest rate and will present the financing components separately as financial income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not have any such financial income.\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from the invoice date. Our agreements with customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise a concern over delivered products or services, we have endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nWe have elected to treat shipping and handling activities after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised good or service. Accordingly, we will accrue all fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of consumer goods at the time of shipment. We have payment terms with its customers of one year or less and has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts not to consider the time value of money. Sales, value add, and other taxes we collect concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nWe receive payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from the satisfaction of performance obligations. There are no contract assets related to performance under the contract. The difference in the opening and closing balances of our deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between our performance and the customers payment. We fulfill obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Accounts receivables are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. We recognize deferred revenue when consideration has been received or an amount of consideration is due from the customer, and we have a future obligation to transfer certain proprietary products.\nIn accordance with ASC 606-10-50-13, we are required to include disclosure on its remaining performance obligations as of the end of the current reporting period. Due to the nature of our contracts, these reporting requirements are not applicable. The majority of our remaining contracts meet certain exemptions as defined in ASC 606-10-50-14 through 606-10-50-14A, including (i) performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) the right to invoice practical expedient.\nWe generally provide a one-year warranty on our products for materials and workmanship but may provide multiple-year warranties as negotiated, and will pass on the warranties from its vendors, if any, which generally covers this one-year period. In accordance with ASC 450-20-25, we accrue for product warranties when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounting for Business Combinations\nWe allocated the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development assets, and liabilities assumed, based upon their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. These fair values are typically estimated with assistance from independent valuation specialists. The purchase price allocation process requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets, contractual support obligations assumed, contingent consideration arrangements, and pre-acquisition contingencies.\nAlthough we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.\nExamples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future include but are not limited to:\n\u25cf future expected cash flows from software license sales, support agreements, consulting contracts, other customer contracts, and acquired developed technologies;\n\u25cf expected costs to develop in-process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed;\n\u25cf the acquired companys brand and competitive position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined companys product portfolio;\n\u25cf cost of capital and discount rates; and\n\u25cf estimating the useful lives of acquired assets as well as the pattern or manner in which the assets will amortize.\nThe fair value estimates related to the various identified intangible assets were determined under various valuation approaches including the Income Approach, Relief-from-Royalty Method, and Discounted Cash Flow Method. These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets is the result of the acquisition of TriGrow Systems, LLC (TriGrow), which occurred in 2020, the acquisition of Precision Extraction NewCo, LLC (Precision) and Cascade Sciences, LLC (Cascade) which occurred in 2021, the acquisition of PurePressure, LLC (PurePressure), which also occurred in 2021, and the acquisition of Lab Society, which occurred in 2022. As a result of these transactions, customer relationships, acquired developed technology, non-compete agreements and trade names were identified as intangible assets, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nWe recognize the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of the year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the goodwill may not be recoverable. We have determined that were a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting the goodwill impairment assessment. A goodwill impairment charge is recorded if the amount by which our carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Factors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and a decline in our market value as a result of a significant decline in our stock price.\nDuring the three-month ended June 30, 2022, we identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in our stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, we deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of our property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022. Based on our interim testing, we noted that the entire carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets should be impaired. Additional information regarding our interim testing on goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nWe evaluate our convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815 Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that we identify and record certain embedded conversion options (ECOs), certain variable-share settlement features, and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. We reassess the classification of our derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. Bifurcated embedded conversion options, variable-share settlement features and any related freestanding instruments are recorded as a discount to the host instrument which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective note using the effective interest method.\nIf we determine that an instrument is not a derivative liability, we then evaluate whether there is a beneficial conversion feature (BCF), by comparing the commitment date fair value to the effective current conversion price of the instrument. We record a BCF as a debt discount which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective note using the effective interest method. BCFs that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event are recognized when the contingency is resolved.\nWarrant Liabilities\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued private placement stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815. We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. Our assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to our own Common Stock among other conditions for equity classification.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, they are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that are precluded from equity classification, they are recorded as a liability at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and subject to remeasurement on each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants to be recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nCapitalization of Internal Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize on certain software engineering efforts related to the continued development of Agrify Insights\u2122 cultivation software (Agrify Insights\u2122) under ASC 985-20. Costs incurred during the application development phase are only capitalized once technical feasibility has been established and the work performed will result in new or additional functionality. The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation, as well as consulting fees for third-party software developers working on these projects. Costs related to the research and development are expensed as incurred until technical feasibility is established as well as post-implementation activities. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from two to five years.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.\nWe follow the provisions of ASC 740-10-25-5, Basic Recognition Threshold. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10-25-6, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. We believe our tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, we have not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe recognize the benefit of a tax position when it is effectively settled. ASC 740-10-25-10, Basic Recognition Threshold provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. ASC 740-10-25-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions considered effectively settled, we recognize the full amount of the tax benefit.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe follow the provisions of ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718) which establishes standards surrounding the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges our equity instruments for goods or services. ASC 718 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions, such as options issued under our Stock Option Plans.\nThe fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free market interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life, and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock.\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock options and warrants have characteristics different from those of our traded stock, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in managements opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of such stock options. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities with a term similar to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is based upon our history of having never issued a dividend and managements current expectation of future action surrounding dividends. We calculate the expected volatility of the stock price based on the corresponding volatility of our peer group stock price for a period consistent with the underlying instruments expected term. The expected lives for such grants were based on the simplified method for employees and directors.\nIn arriving at stock-based compensation expense, we estimate the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. Our forfeiture assumption is based primarily on its turn-over historical experience. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements. The expense we recognize in future periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the current period.\nIt is important that the discussion of our operating results that follows be read in conjunction with the critical accounting policies disclosed above.\nResults of Operations\nWe have incurred recurring losses to date. Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation.\nOur continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until we begin generating sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. If we are unable raise additional funds, we may be forced to cease operations.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nRevenue (including $2,417 and $31,439 from related parties, respectively)\n$ 58,259\n$ 59,859\nCost of goods sold\n90,054\n54,625\nGross (loss) profit\n(31,795 )\n5,234\nGeneral and administrative\n73,354\n30,807\nSelling and marketing\n9,338\n4,163\nResearch and development\n8,179\n3,925\nChange in contingent consideration\n(2,156 )\n1,412\nImpairment of property and equipment\n2,912\n-\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\n69,904\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n161,531\n40,307\nLoss from operations\n(193,326 )\n(35,073 )\nInterest (expense) income, net\n(8,750 )\nOther expense, net\n1,316\n(31 )\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\n51,461\n-\nGain on forgiveness of PPP Loan\n-\n(Loss) gain on extinguishment of notes payable\n(38,985 )\n2,685\nOther income, net\n5,042\n2,773\nNet loss before income taxes\n(188,284 )\n(32,300 )\nIncome tax expense\n(23 )\n(25 )\nNet loss\n(188,307 )\n(32,325 )\n(Income) loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n(140 )\nNet loss attributable to Agrify Corporation\n$ (188,173 )\n$ (32,465 )\nRevenues\nOur goal is to provide our customers with a variety of products to address their entire indoor agriculture needs. Our core product offering includes our VFUs and Agrify Integrated Grow Racks with our Agrify Insights\u2122, which are supplemented with environmental control products, grow lights, facility build-out services, and extraction equipment.\nWe generate revenue from sales of cultivation solutions, including ancillary products and services, Agrify Insights\u2122, facility build-outs, and extraction equipment and solutions. We believe that our product mix forms an integrated ecosystem that allows us to be engaged with our potential customers from the early stages of the grow cycle - first during the facility build-out, to the choice of cultivation solutions, running the grow business with our Agrify Insights\u2122 and finally, our extraction, post-processing, and testing services to transform harvest into a sellable product. We believe that the delivery of each solution in the various stages of the process will generate sales of additional solutions and services.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nCultivation solutions, including ancillary products and services $ 711 $ 11,354 $ (10,643 ) (94 )%\nAgrify Insights\u2122 825 %\nFacility build-outs 23,129 36,193 (13,064 ) (36 )%\nExtraction solutions 34,345 12,304 22,041 179 %\nTotal revenue $ 58,259 $ 59,859 $ (1,600 ) (3 )%\nRevenues decreased by $1.6 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. The comparative decrease in revenue was primarily driven by a $13.1 million reduction in facility build-outs due to completion of one construction project and $7.0 million of revenue for Bud & Marys that was deferred due to pending litigation. Additionally, there was a $10.6 million decrease in cultivation solutions due to the migration to a VFU leasing model. This was partially offset by revenue generated by our extraction solutions sales of equipment and services from our acquisition of Lab Society in 2022 and Precision, Cascade, and PurePressure in 2021, which contributed $22.0 million.\nCost of Goods Sold\nCost of goods sold represents a combination of the following: construction-related costs associated with our facility build-outs, internal and outsourced labor and material costs associated with the assembly of both cultivation equipment (primarily VFUs), and extraction equipment, as well as labor and parts costs associated with the sale or provision of other products and services.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of our cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nCultivation solutions, including ancillary products, and services $ 27,513 $ 10,855 $ 16,658 153 %\nAgrify Insights\u2122 - - - - %\nFacility build-outs 31,588 35,012 (3,424 ) (10 )%\nExtraction solutions 30,953 8,758 22,195 253 %\nTotal cost of goods sold $ 90,054 $ 54,625 $ 35,429 65 %\nCost of goods sold increased $35.4 million, or 65%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, as compared to the same period in 2021. The year-over-year increase in cost of goods sold is primarily associated with increased inventory reserves due to the overall decline in the market and obsolescence. The decline in facility build-outs was the result of the completion of one construction project and the cessation of construction on the Bud and Marys project due to pending litigation.\nGross (Loss) Profit\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nGross (loss) profit $ (31,795 ) $ 5,234 $ (37,029 ) (707 )%\nGross loss totaled $31.8 million, or (54.6)%, of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a gross profit of $5.2 million, or 8.7% of total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. The comparative $37.0 million year-over-year decline in gross profit, as well as the comparative decline in gross profit margin, is primarily attributable to reserves for inventory and facility build-outs. The Bud & Marys project was the main contributor to the gross margin decline in facility build-outs due to the pending litigation. The gross profit decline was partially offset by increased Extraction solutions revenue in 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nGeneral and administrative $ 73,354 $ 30,807 $ 42,547 138 %\nSelling and marketing 9,338 4,163 5,175 124 %\nResearch and development 8,179 3,925 4,254 108 %\nChange in contingent consideration (2,156 ) 1,412 (3,568 ) (253 )%\nImpairment of property and equipment 2,912 - 2,912 NA\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets 69,904 - 69,904 NA\nTotal operating expenses $ 161,531 $ 40,307 $ 121,224 301 %\nGeneral and administrative\nGeneral and administrative (G&A) expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses, for personnel associated with executive and other administrative functions. Other G&A expenses include, but are not limited to, professional fees for legal, consulting, depreciation and amortization, and accounting services, as well as facility-related costs.\nG&A expenses increased by $42.5 million, or 138%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The primary drivers of the year-over-year increase of G&A expenses were largely attributable to an increase in trade and loan receivable allowances of $33.1 million, primarily related to our TTK projects, and an increase of $6.3 million in employee related expenses and severance expense.\nDuring the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2022, we increased our loan receivable reserve by approximately $7.1 million, $14.7 million, and $11.3 million, respectively. The $7.1 million increase during the second quarter of 2022 was specifically related to Greenstone Holdings (Greenstone). Greenstone is a related party because one of our former Agrify Brands employees and our VP of Engineering had a minority ownership. We specifically established the loan reserve related to Greenstone based on our review of Greenstones financial stability, which would impact collectability and is primarily the result of unfavorable market conditions within the Colorado market. We wrote off the entire Greenstone loan receivable as of June 30, 2023. Additional information regarding recent developments with Greenstone may be found in Note 5 - Loans Receivable, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The $14.7 million increase during the third quarter of 2022 specifically related to Bud & Marys. We deemed it necessary to fully reserve Bud & Marys loan receivable balance due to the current litigation and the uncertainty of the customers ability to repay the outstanding balance. We believe the litigation is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend ourselves. The $11.3 million increase during the fourth quarter of 2022 related to three customer balances that were fully or partially reserved.\nSelling and marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs of personnel, travel expenses, trade shows, and advertising expenses.\nSelling and marketing expenses increased by $5.2 million, or 124%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The comparative period increase was primarily related to our acquisition of Lab Society in 2022 and the acquisitions of Precision, Cascade, and PurePressure in 2021, which contributed $3.7 million of increased selling and marketing expenses, an increase in payroll, severance, and related expenses of $957 thousand, and an increase in advertising, trade shows, and other expenses of $558 thousand.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development (R&D) expenses consisted primarily of costs incurred for the development of our Agrify Insights\u2122 and next-generation VFUs, which includes:\n\u25cf employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and travel;\n\u25cf subcontractor expenses incurred under agreements to provide engineering work related to the development of our next-generation VFUs; and\n\u25cf expenses related to our facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, and other supplies.\nR&D expenses increased by $4.3 million, or 108%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. The comparative period increase is primarily related to our acquisition of Lab Society in 2022 and the acquisitions of Precision, Cascade, and PurePressure in 2021, which increased research and development expenses by $1.8 million, an increase in consulting and other cost of $1.8 million, and an increase in payroll, severance, and related expenses of $736 thousand. As a percentage of net revenue, R&D expenses were 14.0% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to 6.6% for same period in 2021.\nWe expect to continue to invest in future developments for our VFUs, Agrify Insights\u2122, and extraction products. Although we continue to invest in R&D activities, we expect R&D expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue as our revenue grows.\nChange in contingent consideration\nContingent consideration decreased $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to an increase of $1.4 million for the same period in 2021. The change in contingent consideration, which was recognized by us during the second and third quarters of 2022, primarily related to the reduction in the projected earn-out achievement associated with Lab Societys and PurePressures first twelve-month earn-out period, for which revenue projections were trending below our original earn-out estimates used in calculating the fair value of the contingent consideration.\nImpairment of property and equipment\nResults from a 50% reserve on equipment to be leased to Hannah Industries due to uncertainty of the project.\nImpairment of goodwill and intangible assets\nDuring the three months ended June 30, 2022, we identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in our stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, we deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of our property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022.\nBased on our interim testing, we noted that the current carrying value of equity significantly exceeded the calculated fair value of equity, by an amount greater than the aggregate value of our goodwill and intangible assets. Accordingly, we concluded that the entire carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets were impaired, resulting in a second-quarter impairment charge of $69.9 million. Additional information regarding our interim impairment testing may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther Income, Net\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nInterest (expense) income, net $ (8,750 ) $ 74 $ (8,824 ) (11,924 )%\nOther expense, net 1,316 (31 ) 1,347 (4,345 )%\nChange in fair value of warrant liability 51,461 - 51,461 NA\nGain on forgiveness of PPP loan - (45 ) (100 )%\n(Loss) gain on extinguishment of notes payable (38,985 ) 2,685 (41,670 ) (1,552 )%\n$ 5,042 $ 2,773 $ 2,269 82 %\nInterest (expense) income, net\nInterest expense was approximately $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to interest income of approximately $74 thousand for the same period in 2021. The interest expense in 2022 is primarily attributable to modification of our debt facilities related to our SPA Note and Exchange Note.\nOther expense, net\nOther expense, net increased by $1.3 million, or 4,345%, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the same period in 2021.\nChange in fair value of warrant liability\nChange in fair value of warrant liability was $51.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. There was no change in fair value of warrant liability in 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a non-cash gain of $51.5 million related to changes in the valuation of our liability-classified warrants issued in August and December 2022, which was primarily driven by movements in our stock price. Additional information regarding the fair value of our liability-classified warrants may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nGain on forgiveness of PPP loan\nIn September 2021, the PPP loan for $45 thousand was forgiven by the U.S. Small Business Administration. As a result, we recorded a gain of $45 thousand on the forgiveness of the loan and the associated accrued interest. There was no associated forgiveness in the year ended December 31, 2022.\n(Loss) gain on extinguishment of notes payable\nLoss on extinguishment of notes payable was $39.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to a gain of $2.7 million for the same period in 2021. The loss on extinguishment of notes payable, which was recognized by us during the third quarter of 2022, related to the extinguishment of the SPA Note dated March 14, 2022. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of $39.0 million (inclusive of $13.1 million of unamortized warrants, $5.0 million for a default penalty on the principal amount, $2.3 million of unamortized issuance costs, and $1.2 million for the incremental fair value of warrants modified in exchange of debt). Additional information relating to our SPA Note may be found in Note 9 - Debt, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe gain on extinguishment of $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the derecognition of the net carrying amount of extinguished debt of $19.7 million (inclusive of $13.1 million of principal, $7.1 million of derivative liabilities, less $587 thousand of debt discount) and the recognition of the $17.0 million fair value of a new convertible note (including the same principal amount of $13.1 million plus the $3.9 million fair value of the beneficial conversion feature). Additional information relating to our gain on extinguishment of notes payable may be found in Note 11 - Convertible Promissory Notes, included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome Tax Expense\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands) Change % Change\nIncome tax expense $ (23 ) $ (25 ) $ 2 (0.1 )%\nEffective tax rate 0.0 % 0.0 %\nIncome (Loss) Attributable to Non-Controlling Interest\nWe consolidate the results of operations of two less than wholly-owned entities into our consolidated statements of operations. On December 8, 2019, we formed Agrify-Valiant, LLC (Agrify-Valiant), a joint-venture limited liability company in which we are the 60% majority owner and Valiant-America, LLC owns 40%. Agrify-Valiant started its operations during the second quarter of 2020. On October 27, 2022, we provided notice to Valiant-America of our intention to begin the winding up of Agrify-Valiant. On January 22, 2020, as part of the acquisition of TriGrow, we received TriGrows 75% interest in Agrify Brands, LLC (formerly TriGrow Brands, LLC), a licensor of an established portfolio of consumer brands that utilize our grow technology. The license for these brands is ancillary to the sale of our VFUs and provides a means to differentiate customers products in the marketplace. It is not a material aspect of our business and we have not realized any royalty income. Accordingly, we are currently evaluating whether to continue this legacy business from an operational standpoint, as well as from a legal and regulatory perspective.\nIncome (loss) attributable to non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit (or loss) that is attributable to the non-controlling interest calculated as a product of the net income of the entity multiplied by the percentage of ownership held by the non-controlling interest.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOperating Capital Requirements\nWe have incurred operating losses since our inception and have negative cash flows from operations. We have an accumulated deficit of approximately $247.1 million as of December 31, 2022. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, including limitations that may apply to us under applicable SEC regulations, from the capital markets.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $20.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. Our restricted cash and restricted marketable securities of $10.0 million is associated with the Exchange Note as of December 31, 2022. Current liabilities were $70.6 million as of December 31, 2022.\nOn October 18, 2022, we entered into the ATM Program with the Agent pursuant to which we could issue and sell, from time to time, shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, depending on market demand, with the Agent acting as an agent for sales. The ATM Program allowed us to sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to specific parameters defined by us as well as those defined by the SEC and the ATM Program agreement. Beginning October 18, 2022 through December 31, 2022, we sold 306,628 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $50.85, resulting in gross proceeds of $15.6 million and net proceeds of $15.1 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $468 thousand. Subsequent to December 31, 2022 through April 1, 2023, after which time the ATM program was discontinued, we sold an additional 323,082 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $4.93, resulting in gross proceeds of $1.6 million and net proceeds of $1.6 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $48 thousand. For the entire period from October 18, 2022 through April 1, 2023, we sold 629,710 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $27.29 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $17.2 million, and net proceeds of $16.7 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $516 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the Investor under the Exchange Note. We used the net proceeds generated from the ATM Program for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding its transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts and capital expenditures. Due to the late filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are no longer eligible to utilize the registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the ATM Program, and do not anticipate any further sales under the ATM Program in the foreseeable future.\nOur current working capital needs are to support revenue growth, fund construction and equipment financing commitments associated with our TTK Solutions, manage inventory to meet demand forecasts and support operational growth. Our long-term financial needs primarily include working capital requirements and capital expenditures. We anticipate that we will allocate a significant portion of our current balance of working capital to satisfy the financing requirements of our current and possible future TTK arrangements. These arrangements require a significant amount of upfront capital necessary to fund construction, associated with facility build-outs, and equipment. We do not intend to enter into any new TTK Solutions for the foreseeable future, however, we have deployed this program with certain key customers.\nWe may opportunistically raise debt capital, subject to market and other conditions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategies, we may also raise debt capital for strategic alternatives and general corporate purposes. If additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared based on the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next twelve-months from the date these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. However, we have incurred operating losses since our inception and have negative cash flows from operations, and our significant operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until we begin generating sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations. If we are unable to raise additional funds, we may be forced to cease operations.\nThere is no assurance that we will ever be profitable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the potential future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nIndebtedness\nWe entered into one Loan Agreement and Promissory Note with Bank of America pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration. We received total proceeds of approximately $779 thousand from the unsecured PPP Loan which was originally scheduled to mature in May 2022. We applied for forgiveness on the $779 thousand of our PPP Loan however was denied by the SBA. On June 23, 2022, we received a letter from Bank of America agreeing to extend the maturity date to May 7, 2025 and bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. The PPP loan is payable in 34 equal combined monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $24 thousand that commenced on August 7, 2022.\nOn March 14, 2022, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with an institutional investor. The Purchase Agreement provides for the issuance of the SPA Note in the aggregate amount of $65.0 million and a SPA Warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock, with the potential for two potential subsequent closings for notes with an original principal amount of $35.0 million each.\nOn August 18, 2022, we entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, we partially paid $35.2 million along with approximately $300 thousand in repayments for other fees under the SPA Note and exchanged the remaining balance of the SPA Note for an Exchange Note with an aggregate original principal amount of $35.0 million and a Note Exchange Warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock. Additionally, we exchanged the SPA Warrant for a Modified Warrant for the same number of underlying shares but with a reduced exercise price.\nOn March 8, 2023, the Company entered into a new Securities Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the March 2023 Exchange Agreement, we prepaid approximately $10.3 million in principal amount under the Exchange Note and exchanged $10.0 million in principal amount of the remaining balance of the Exchange Note for a new senior secured convertible note (the Convertible Note).\nThe Convertible Note is a senior secured obligation and will rank senior to all of our indebtedness. The Convertible Note will mature on August 19, 2025 (the Maturity Date) and has a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash. The principal amount of the Convertible Note will be payable on the maturity date, provided that the lender will be entitled to a cash sweep of 30% of the proceeds of any at-the-market equity offering and 20% of the proceeds received by us in connection with any other equity financing, which will reduce the outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note. On October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC, and entity affiliated with and controlled by Raymond Chang, acquired the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note. As of October 30, 2023, there was approximately $6.7 million outstanding under the Exchange Note and $8.8 million outstanding under the Convertible Note.\nAt any time, we may prepay all of the Exchange Note by redemption at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Note plus accrued but unpaid interest. The holder will also have the option of requiring us to redeem the Exchange Note on the one-year or two-year anniversaries of issuance at a price equal to the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest, or if we undergo a fundamental change at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest.\nSummary Statement of Cash Flows\nThe following table presents the major components of net cash flows from and used in operating, investing, and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nNet cash (used in) provided by:\nOperating activities $ (72,021 ) $ (30,149 )\nInvesting activities (2,317 ) (104,740 )\nFinancing activities 72,781 138,792\nNet increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,557 ) $ 3,903\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash used in operating activities consists of net loss adjusted for non-cash benefits and expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used in operating activities increased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher inventory purchases to meet demand, increased construction costs related to TTK Solutions, payments for employee-related expenditures, and other working capital needs.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable securities, cash paid associated with our 2022 and 2021 acquisitions, the issuance of loans receivable in connection with our financing of construction and equipment under our TTK Solutions offering, and purchases of property and equipment. Capital expenditures are used to expand research, development, and testing capabilities and, to a lesser extent, to replace existing equipment. Investing activities used $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the use of $104.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to net cash of $34.3 million provided by purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities in 2022, compared to net cash of $44.5 million used for purchases, sales, and maturities of marketable securities in 2021, along with decreased cash paid for business combinations, partially offset by an increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, debt, and warrants in private placements and proceeds from public offerings. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repayment of our debt. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, largely due to the repayment of debt. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe consolidated financial statements required to be filed pursuant to this Item 8 are appended to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which consolidated financial statements are incorporated by reference in response to this Item 8. An index of those consolidated financial statements is found in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures.\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, management identified material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses related to the accounting for complex financial instruments, inadequate design of the controls over the preparation of the consolidated financial statements due to the lack of a timeline and process in place to timely close our annual books and records, and insufficient technical accounting resources and lack of segregation of duties. These deficiencies could result in misstatements to our consolidated financial statements that could be material and may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm because we are an emerging growth company, and may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nRemediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs of December 31, 2022 and through the date of this filing, we were in varying stages of remediating the current and previously reported material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, we have increased the number of accounting resources employed by us. We have added technically qualified personnel and are in the process of improving our technical accounting resources and capabilities. However, the finance team has remained weakened, with the departure of our CFO and VP of Finance. We are in the process of rebuilding the finance function and have engaged outside consultants to assist. We will need to continue to devote specific attention to these aspects of our internal control environment to ensure that these material weaknesses are fully remediated.\nThe material weaknesses identified will not be considered fully remediated until these additional controls and procedures have operated effectively for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plans and will make changes management determines to be appropriate. If not remediated, these material weaknesses could result in material misstatements to our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or result in a delayed filing of required periodic reports. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or when required in the future, if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an unqualified opinion as to the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected, and we could become subject to litigation or investigations by the Nasdaq Capital Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOther than the changes to remediate the material weaknesses noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Our Board of Directors is committed to the principle of independence from management and to the highest standards of corporate governance. All of our directors other than Messrs. Chang and Hua are independent under Nasdaq listing rules. Our Nominating and Corporate Governance, Audit and Compensation Committees are currently composed entirely of independent directors. Our Board of Directors has adopted a flexible policy regarding the issue of whether the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer should be separate or combined. This policy allows the Board to evaluate regularly whether the Company is best served at any particular time by having our Chief Executive Officer or another director hold the position of Chairman.\nCurrently, the Board believes there are several important advantages to combining the positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer is the director most familiar with our business and industry and is most capable of effectively identifying strategic priorities and leading the discussion and execution of strategy. The Companys independent directors bring experience, oversight, and expertise from outside the Company and industry, while the Chief Executive Officer brings Company-specific experience and expertise. Combining the Chief Executive Officer and Chairman positions creates a firm link between management and the Board, promotes the development and implementation of corporate strategy and facilitates information flow between management and the Board, which are essential to effective governance. The Board currently believes that combining the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer contributes to a more efficient and effective Board, does not undermine the independence of the Board, and certainly has no bearing on the ethical integrity of the directors.\nBoard and Board Committee Matters\nThe Board currently consists of six directors. The Board has determined that Max Holtzman, Timothy Mahoney, Leonard J. Sokolow, and Krishnan Varier are all Independent directors under the Nasdaq listing standards.\nAs required by the Nasdaq listing standards, the Board must be composed of a majority of independent directors. The committee charters are reviewed annually and updated as necessary to reflect changes in regulatory requirements and evolving oversight practices.\nThe Board currently has four standing committees consisting of: the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Compensation Committee, and the Audit Committee and the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee. No member of the Audit, Compensation or Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is an employee of the Company or its subsidiaries, and all are currently independent as defined by the Nasdaq listing standards. In March 2022, the Company became aware of a consulting arrangement between an entity partially owned by Mr. Mahoney and the Company that resulted in Mr. Mahoney not being considered independent for purposes of Audit Committee membership. Mr. Mahoney did not provide any consulting services on behalf of the consulting group and did not receive any fees from the consulting group in connection with the agreement between the consulting group and the Company. The Company promptly terminated the consulting relationship, upon which Mr. Mahoney regained his independent status for Audit Committee purposes. Each of the Audit, Compensation and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees has a written charter approved by the Board of Directors. The committee charters as well as the Companys Code of Conduct and Ethics, which applies to all directors, officers and employees, are available under Corporate Governance in the Investor Relations section of our Companys website at https://ir.agrify.com. Please note that the information contained on the Company website is not incorporated by reference in, or considered to be a part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe current members of the Committees are identified below:\nDirector Nominating\nand Corporate\nGovernance Compensation Audit Mergers and\nAcquisitions\nMax Holtzman X (Chair) X\nX\nTimothy Mahoney X X (Chair) X X\nLeonard J.

The Compensation Committee is responsible for discharging the responsibilities of the Board with respect to the compensation of our executive officers. The Compensation Committee sets performance goals and objectives for the Chief Executive Officer and the other executive officers, evaluates their performance with respect to those goals and sets their compensation based upon the evaluation of their performance. In evaluating executive officer pay, the Compensation Committee has retained the services of a compensation consultant and considers recommendations from the Chief Executive Officer with respect to goals and compensation of the other executive officers. The Compensation Committee assesses the information it receives in accordance with its business judgment. The Compensation Committee also periodically reviews director compensation. All decisions with respect to executive and director compensation are approved by the Compensation Committee and, in the case of director compensation, ratified by the Board. Mr. Wilcox served as a member of the committee until his resignation from the Board on July 14, 2022.\nAudit Committee. The current members of the Audit Committee are directors Varier, who chairs the committee, Mahoney and Sokolow. The Board of Directors has determined that all members of the Audit Committee satisfy the financial literacy requirements of the Nasdaq listing standards and are independent as defined under the Nasdaq listing requirements and applicable Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. In addition, our Board of Directors has determined that each of Messrs. Varier and Sokolow qualifies as an Audit Committee Financial Expert as defined under SEC rules. The Audit Committee is primarily concerned with the accuracy and effectiveness of the audits of our consolidated financial statements by our independent registered public accountants. Its duties include, among other things:\n\u25cf appointing, compensating, retaining, evaluating, terminating, and overseeing our independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u25cf discussing with our independent registered public accounting firm the independence of its members from its management;\n\u25cf reviewing with our independent registered public accounting firm the scope and results of their audit;\n\u25cf approving all audit and permissible non-audit services to be performed by our independent registered public accounting firm;\n\u25cf overseeing the financial reporting process and discussing with management and our independent registered public accounting firm the interim and annual consolidated financial statements that we file with the SEC;\n\u25cf reviewing and monitoring our accounting principles, accounting policies, financial and accounting controls, and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements;\n\u25cf coordinating the oversight by our board of directors of our code of business conduct and our disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u25cf establishing procedures for the confidential and/or anonymous submission of concerns regarding accounting, internal controls or auditing matters; and\n\u25cf reviewing and approving related-person transactions.\nThe Audit Committees procedures for the pre-approval of audit and permitted non-audit services are described in Item 5: Ratification of the Auditor Appointment. For more information on the Audit Committee, refer to the Report of the Audit Committee included elsewhere herein.\nMergers and Acquisitions Committee. The current members of the Mergers and Acquisitions Committee are directors Varier, who chairs the committee, Mahoney and Holtzman. The purpose of the Mergers & Acquisitions Committee is to assist the Board and the Audit Committee in evaluating any related party transactions that the Company may consider from time to time. Mr. Wilcox served as a member of the committee until his resignation from the Board on July 14, 2022.\nBoard of Directors Oversight of Risk\nOur management bears responsibility for the management and assessment of risk at the Company on a daily basis. Management is also responsible for communicating the most material risks to the Board and its committees, who provide oversight of the risk management practices implemented by management. Our full Board provides oversight for risk management, except for the oversight of risks that have been specifically delegated to a committee. Even when the oversight of a specific area of risk has been delegated to a committee, the full Board may maintain oversight over such risks through the receipt of reports from the committee. In addition, the full Board may assume oversight over a particular risk, even if the risk was initially overseen by a committee, when the Board deems it appropriate. The Board and committee reviews occur principally through the receipt of regular reports from Company management on these areas of risk and discussions with management regarding risk assessment and risk management.\nCommittees. The Audit Committee maintains initial oversight over risks related to the integrity of the Companys consolidated financial statements, internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls, the performance of the Companys independent registered public accounting firm and the operation of the Companys ethics program. The Companys Compensation Committee maintains initial oversight of risks related to the Companys compensation practices, including practices related to equity programs, other executive or Company-wide incentive programs and hiring and retention. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to independence of Board members and compliance with SEC rules and Nasdaq listing standards with respect to Board and committee composition.\nFull Board. At its regularly scheduled meetings, the Board generally receives several reports which include information relating to specific risks faced by the Company. As appropriate, the Companys Chief Executive Officer or other members of senior management provide operational reports, which include risks relating to the Companys business. At each regularly scheduled Board meeting, the full Board also receives reports from committee chairpersons, which may include a discussion of risks initially overseen by the committees for discussion and input from the full Board. As noted above, in addition to these regular reports, the Board receives reports on specific areas of risk from time-to-time, such as cyclical or other risks that are not covered in the regular reports given to the Board.\nCode of Ethics and Business Conduct\nThe Company has adopted a code of ethics and business conduct that applies to our directors, officers and employees. This code of ethics and business conduct (which we refer to as a code of conduct) may be accessed and reviewed through the Companys website at https://ir.agrify.com. Any amendments to, or waivers from, any provisions of the code of conduct which apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or any person performing similar functions, will be disclosed either on a Current Report on Form 8-K or on our website promptly following the date of any such amendment or waiver.\nDelinquent Section 16(a) Reports\nUnder the U.S. securities laws, directors, executive officers and persons holding more than 10% of the Companys Common Stock must report their initial ownership of the Common Stock and any changes in that ownership to the SEC. The SEC has designated specific due dates for these reports and we must identify in this Annual Report on Form 10-K those persons who did not file these reports when due. Based solely on our review of the copies of these forms received by us or written representations furnished to us, we believe that, for the reporting period covering our 2022 fiscal year, our executive officers and directors complied with all their reporting requirements under Section 16(a) for this fiscal year, except for (i) Form 4s filed by Messrs. Chang and Wilcox on February 2, 2022 relating to transactions that occurred on January 28, 2022 due to an administrative oversight, (ii) a Form 4 filed by Mr. Holtzman on July 21, 2022 relating to a grant that occurred on July 14, 2022 due to a delay in obtaining EDGAR codes, (iii) Form 3s filed by Steve Drucker and Chris Benyo on July 28, 2022 relating to a reportable event on July 14, 2022 due to a delay in obtaining EDGAR codes, (iv) a Form 3 filed by David Kessler on August 5, 2022 relating to a reportable event on July 14, 2022 due to a delay in obtaining EDGAR codes, (v) a Form 3 filed by Timothy Hayden on November 14, 2022 relating to a reportable event on November 1, 2022 due to an administrative oversight, and (vi) a Form 4 filed by Timothy Oakes on December 19, 2022 relating to a grant that occurred on November 10, 2022 due to an administrative oversight.\nStockholder Nomination Procedures\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there have been no material changes to the procedures by which stockholders may recommend nominees to our Board of Directors. Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nThis section describes the compensation paid, or payable, for the last two fiscal years to our named executive officers.

The Company competes for talent in a highly competitive market in which companies routinely offer similar benefits to senior executives. The Compensation Committee believes that providing severance and change in control benefits to its Named Executive Officers reduces any reluctance of senior management to pursue potential change in control transactions that may be in the best interests of stockholders. In addition, the income security provided by competitive severance and change in control arrangements helps minimize distractions caused by uncertain personal financial circumstances during the negotiation of a potential change in control transaction, a period of time requiring focused and thoughtful leadership to ensure a successful outcome.\nEmployment Agreement for Mr. Chang: On January 4, 2021, the Company entered into a three-year employment agreement with Mr. Chang as the Companys Chief Executive Officer, effective February 1, 2021 (the Mr. Changs Employment Agreement). The Mr. Changs Employment Agreement, at the end of the initial three-year term, if not terminated by either Mr. Chang or the Company, automatically renews for a successive three-year period.\nMr. Changs Employment Agreement establishes a minimum annual base salary level of $300,000 and provides for a discretionary bonus of $300,000, with payment subject to Mr. Chang being employed by the Company at the time of payment.\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Changs employment is terminated by the Company without cause, or in connection with a change of control, or by Mr. Chang for good reason, Mr. Chang will be entitled to receive certain severance benefits, including severance pay equal to the greater of (a) 300% of his annual base salary and (b) $1,000,000. Mr. Chang will also be eligible to receive insurance benefits for a period of up to twelve months following his termination of employment. We can terminate Mr. Changs employment for cause only if we receive the unanimous agreement of our board of directors. In addition, if we terminate his employment without cause, or if Mr. Chang resigns for good reason, or upon the occurrence of a change of control, all of his issued but unvested options will immediately vest.\nIn addition to the terms of our standard invention assignment, restrictive covenants, and confidentiality agreement, Mr. Changs employment agreement contains confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-competition provisions, whereby Mr. Chang is subject to non-solicitation restrictions for a period of at least one year and to non-competition restrictions for a period of at least six months following his employment period.\nOn November 8, 2021, the Compensation Committee, in contemplation of expected executive level changes within the Company, performed a market study of compensation trends related to our various executive level positions. Based upon this review, the Compensation Committee approved increases to Mr. Changs base salary (increasing it from $300,000 to $350,000) and discretionary bonus (from $300,000 to $400,000), effective as of January 1, 2022.\nEmployment Offer Letter for Mr. Kessler: On January 20, 2020, the Company provided a letter of employment offer to Mr. Kessler, as amended by the updated offer letter effective as of August 9, 2022 (as amended, the Offer Letter).\nMr. Kesslers Offer Letter established a minimum annual base salary level of $250,000 and provided for a discretionary performance-based bonus of $150,000.

The agreement, at the end of the initial two-year term, if not terminated by either Mr. Massie or the Company, would automatically renew for successive one-year periods.\nMr. Massies Employment Agreement established a minimum annual base salary level of $300,000 and provided for a discretionary performance-based bonus of $300,000, payable in quarterly $75,000 installments, with payment subject to Mr. Massie being employed by the Company at the time of payment. The Board could from time to time elect to pay additional bonuses based on performance that exceeded the mutually agreed upon goals.\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Massies employment was terminated by the Company without cause, or in connection with a change of control, or by Mr. Massie for good reason, Mr. Massie would be entitled to receive certain severance benefits, including severance pay equal to the greater of (a) 100% of his annual base salary plus his projected bonus for such fiscal year and (b) $1,000,000. Mr. Massie would also be eligible to receive insurance benefits for a period of up to twelve months following his termination of employment. We could terminate Mr. Massies employment for cause only if we receive the unanimous agreement of our board of directors. In addition, if we terminated his employment without cause, or if Mr. Massie resigned for good reason, or upon the occurrence of a change of control, all of his issued but unvested options would immediately vest.\nIn addition to the terms of our standard invention assignment, restrictive covenants, and confidentiality agreement, Mr. Massies employment agreement contained confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-competition provisions, whereby Mr. Massie is subject to non-solicitation restrictions for a period of at least one year and to non-competition restrictions for a period of at least six months following his employment period. Mr. Massie resigned as President and Chief Operating Officer effective July 8, 2022.\nSeparation Agreement for Mr. Massie: On July 8, 2022, we entered into a separation agreement with Mr. Massie (the Separation Agreement). Per the terms of the Separation Agreement, Mr. Massie will receive (a) an aggregate of $1,000,000 in severance payments, payable in monthly installments of $83,333.33 from July 2022 through December 2022 and one installment of $500,000 in January 2023, (b) continuation of health insurance benefits through June 30, 2023, subject to certain conditions, (c) full vesting of all of Mr. Massies outstanding stock options and restricted stock units, and (d) an extended exercise period for Mr. Massies outstanding stock options through December 31, 2023.\nEmployment Agreement for Mr. Oakes: On November 10, 2021, the Company entered into a two-year employment agreement with Mr. Oakes as the Companys Chief Financial Officer, effective November 10, 2021. The agreement, at the end of the initial one-year term, if not terminated by either Mr. Oakes or the Company, automatically renews for successive one-year periods.\nMr. Oakes Employment Agreement established a minimum annual base salary level of $250,000 and provided for a discretionary performance-based bonus of $200,000, payable in quarterly $50,000 installments, with payment subject to Mr. Oakes being employed by the Company at the time of payment. The Board could from time to time elect to pay additional bonuses based on performance that exceeds the mutually agreed upon goals. On August 8, 2022, based on a report from its independent compensation consultant and discussions with the consultant, the Compensation Committee approved an increase to Mr. Oakes base salary from $250,000 to $275,000 per year, and an increase in his maximum discretionary bonus opportunity from $200,000 to $250,000 per year.\nIn accordance with the terms of the agreement, if Mr. Oakes employment was terminated by the Company without cause, or in connection with a change of control, or by Mr. Oakes for good reason, Mr. Oakes would be entitled to receive certain severance benefits, including severance pay equal to 100% of his annual base salary plus his projected bonus for such fiscal year.

In addition, if we terminated his employment without cause, or if Mr. Oakes resigned for good reason, or upon the occurrence of a change of control, all of his issued but unvested options would immediately vest.\nIn addition to the terms of our standard invention assignment, restrictive covenants, and confidentiality agreement, Mr. Oakes employment agreement contained confidentiality, non-solicitation, and non-competition provisions, whereby Mr. Oakes is subject to non-solicitation restrictions for a period of at least one year and to non-competition restrictions for a period of at least six months following his employment period. Mr. Oakes resigned as Chief Financial Officer effective February 28, 2023.\nPotential Termination Payments and Equity Awards\nThe Employment Agreements for our Named Executive Officers, as described above, generally provide for cash payment in the event that their employment with the Company is terminated in certain circumstances by the Company without cause or by such Named Executive Officer for Good Reason (1) outside of a change of control and (2) in connection with a change of control. The potential payouts each Named Executive Officer may be eligible to receive in either instance under their respective employment agreements is calculated based upon the measurement criteria described above.\nIf the Named Executive Officers covered by employment agreements or severance agreements had their employment terminated as of December 31, 2022, the Named Executive Officers would have been eligible to receive payments, depending upon whether the termination was for Good Reason or based upon a Change in Control, as set forth in the following table.\nTermination Payout Table\nThe following table sets forth information concerning termination payouts for Named Executive Officers as of December 31, 2022.

The Company also considers the independence of its directors.\nDirector and Officer Questionnaires are distributed to executive officers and directors at the beginning of each fiscal year to identify any potential related-party transactions. Within the questionnaire, executive officers and directors are asked to describe any transaction, arrangement or relationship or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, occurring since the beginning of the prior fiscal year, in which the Company was or is to be a participant and the amount involved exceeds $120,000, and in which any of the following had or will have a direct or indirect interest: (i) the individual; (ii) any director or executive officer of the Company; (iii) a nominee for director; (iv) an immediate family member of a director or executive officer of the Company; (v) an immediate family member of a nominee for director; (vi) a security holder of more than 5% of the common stock; or (vii) an immediate family member of the security holder. Responses provided within the questionnaire are reviewed by management of the Company to determine any necessary course of action.\nIt is the policy of the Company that all employees, directors and agents maintain the highest ethical standards and comply with all applicable legal requirements when conducting Company business. Guidelines regarding conflicts of interest are detailed in the Companys Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, which was adopted by the Board. The Companys Code of Conduct and Business Ethics policy is available on the Companys website at https://ir.agrify.com. All Company employees must deal with vendors, customers and others doing business with the Company in a manner that avoids even the appearance of conflict between personal interests and those of the Company. Potential conflicts of interest may arise from any of the following:\n\u25cf a direct or indirect financial interest in any business or organization that is a Company vendor or competitor, if the employee or director can influence decisions with respect to the Companys business with respect to such business or organization; and\n\u25cf serving on the board of directors of, or being employed in any capacity by, a vendor, competitor or customer of the Company.\nThe Audit Committee is authorized to review all potential conflicts of interest involving directors and executive officers.\nRelationships, including business, financial, personal, and family, may give rise to conflicts of interest or the appearance of a conflict. Employees should carefully evaluate their relationships as they relate to Company business to avoid conflict or the appearance of a conflict. To avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of a conflict:\n\u25cf An employee should not work in a position in which he or she has the authority to hire, directly supervise or attempt to influence the employment actions of an immediate family member or romantic partner. Any individual in a supervisory position should not pursue a romantic relationship with any person with whom there is a reporting relationship.\n\u25cf Employees and directors should not have an undisclosed relationship with, or financial interest in, any business that competes or deals with the Company; provided that the ownership of less than 1% of the outstanding shares, units or other interests of any class of publicly traded securities is acceptable.\n\u25cf Employees are prohibited from directly or indirectly competing or performing services for any person or entity in competition with, the Company.\n\u25cf Employees should comply with the policies set forth in this Code of Conduct and Business Ethics regarding the receipt or giving of gifts, favors or entertainment.\n\u25cf A full-time employee should obtain the approval of his or her supervisor before serving as a trustee, regent, director or officer of a philanthropic, professional, national, regional or community organization, or educational institution. This policy applies where significant time spent in support of these functions may interfere with time that should be devoted to the Companys business.\n\u25cf Employees may not sell or lease equipment, materials or property to the Company without appropriate corporate authority.\n\u25cf Employees should purchase Company equipment, materials or property only on terms available to the general public.\nAny employee or director who becomes aware of a conflict is required to bring it to the attention of a supervisor, management or other appropriate personnel.\nDirectors are expected and required to uphold the same dedication to corporate ethics as the Companys employees.\nIf a conflict of interest arises involving an executive officer or director, the Board must approve a waiver to the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics and if a director has the conflict, that director must abstain from the approval. Waivers are made on a case-by-case basis. The Board has not adopted a formal written policy with respect to waiving conflict of interests or approving related party transactions. In making this determination, the Board considered the infrequency in occurrence of these transactions. Any waivers to the Code of Conduct and Business Ethics granted to an executive officer or director shall be disclosed by the Company on its website at https://ir.agrify.com.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDistribution Agreement with Enozo\nGuichao Hua, a member of our board of directors, and Raymond Chang, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, each have ownership interests and are board members of Enozo.\nOn March 9, 2020, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Enozo Technologies Inc.

This policy generally provides that we will not engage our independent registered public accounting firm to render audit or non-audit services unless the service is specifically approved in advance by the Audit Committee or the engagement is entered into pursuant to pre-approval procedures. On an ongoing basis, management communicates specific projects and categories of services for which the advance approval of the Audit Committee is requested.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph - Going Concern\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has a significant working capital deficiency, has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its obligations and sustain its operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum llp\nMarcum llp\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nMelville, NY\nNovember 27, 2023\nAGRIFY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nAs of December 31,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 10,457 $ 12,014\nRestricted cash 10,000 -\nMarketable securities 44,550\nAccounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $4,605 and $1,415 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 1,070 7,222\nInventory, net of reserves of $32,422 and $942 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 21,396 20,498\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets 1,510 2,452\nTotal current assets 44,893 86,736\nLoans receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $33,050 and $0 at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively 12,214 22,255\nProperty and equipment, net 10,044 6,232\nOperating lease right-of-use assets 2,210 1,479\nGoodwill -\n50,090\nIntangible assets, net -\n14,072\nOther non-current assets 1,184\nTotal assets $ 69,687 $ 182,048\nLiabilities and Stockholders Equity\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 20,543 $ 9,151\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 16,380 28,764\nOperating lease liabilities, current\nLong-term debt, current 28,833 1,089\nDeferred revenue 4,112 3,772\nTotal current liabilities 70,602 43,590\nWarrant liabilities 5,985 -\nOperating lease liabilities, net of current 1,587\nLong-term debt, net of current\nOther non-current liabilities\nTotal liabilities 78,728 44,624\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 17)\nStockholders (deficit) equity:\nCommon Stock, $0.001 par value per share, 5,000,000 and 2,500,000 shares authorized at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, 1,038,298 and 111,035 shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively (1) -\nPreferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share, 2,895,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding -\n-\nPreferred A Stock, $0.001 par value per share, 105,000 shares authorized, no shares issued or outstanding -\n-\nAdditional paid-in capital 237,875 196,034\nAccumulated deficit (247,148 ) (58,975 )\nTotal stockholders (deficit) equity attributable to Agrify (9,272 ) 137,059\nNon-controlling interests\nTotal liabilities and stockholders equity $ 69,687 $ 182,048\n(1) Periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the 1-for-10 reverse stock split on October 18, 2022, and the 1-for-20 reverse stock split on July 5, 2023.

Overview, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nAgrify Corporation (Agrify or the Company) is a leading provider of innovative cultivation and extraction solutions for the cannabis industry, bringing data, science, and technology to the forefront of the market. The Companys proprietary micro-environment-controlled Agrify Vertical Farming Units (or VFUs) enable cultivators to produce the highest quality products with what we believe to be unmatched consistency, yield, and return investment at scale. The Companys comprehensive extraction product line, which includes hydrocarbon, alcohol, solventless, post-processing, and lab equipment, empowers producers to maximize the quantity and quality of extract required for premium concentrates.\u202f\nThe Company believes it is the only company with an automated and fully integrated grow solution in the industry. The Companys cultivation and extraction solutions seamlessly combines its integrated hardware and software offerings with a broad range of associated services including consulting, engineering, and construction and is designed to deliver the most complete commercial indoor farming solution available from a single provider. The totality of its product offerings and service capabilities forms an unrivaled ecosystem in what has historically been a highly fragmented market. As a result, the Company believes it is well-positioned to capture market share and create a dominant market position in the indoor cannabis sector.\nThe Company was formed in the State of Nevada on June 6, 2016 as Agrinamics, Inc., and subsequently changed its name to Agrify Corporation. The Company is sometimes referred to herein by the words we, us, our, and similar terminology.\nThe Company has nine wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are collectively referred to as the Subsidiaries and the Company also has ownership interests in certain companies. (Please refer to Exhibit 21.1 for further details.)\nReverse Stock Splits\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its Common Stock. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated.\nOn July 5, 2023, the Company effected a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated.\nNo fractional shares of Common Stock were issued as a result of these reverse stock splits. Any fractional shares in connection with these reverse stock splits were rounded up to the nearest whole share and no stockholders received cash in lieu of fractional shares. The reverse stock splits had no impact on the number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue pursuant to its articles of incorporation or on the par value per share of the Common Stock. Proportional adjustments were made to the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of the Companys outstanding stock options and warrants, the exercise price or conversion price (as applicable) of the Companys outstanding stock options and warrants, and the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Companys equity incentive plan. All share and per share information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of these reverse stock splits.\nInitial Public Offering and Secondary Public Offering\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company closed its initial public offering, or (IPO), of 31,050 shares of its Common Stock (inclusive of 4,050 shares of Common Stock from the full exercise of the over-allotment option of shares granted to the underwriters). The offer and sale of all of the shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File Nos. 333-251616 and 333-252490), which was declared effective by the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 27, 2021. In the IPO, Maxim Group LLC and Roth Capital Partners acted as the underwriters. The IPO price for shares of Common Stock was $2,000.00 per share. The total gross proceeds from the IPO were $62.1 million.\nAfter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $4 million and offering expenses paid by the Company of approximately $1 million, the net proceeds from the IPO were approximately $57 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the IPO for its working capital needs, to support revenue growth, increase inventory to meet customer demand forecasts, and support operational growth.\nOn February 19, 2021, the Company consummated a secondary public offering (the February Offering) of 27,778 shares of its Common Stock for a price of $2,700.00 per share, less certain underwriting discounts, and commissions. On March 22, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 4,167 shares of Common Stock on the same terms and conditions pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option. The exercise of the over-allotment option brought the total number of shares of Common Stock sold by the Company in connection with the February Offering to 31,945 shares and the total net proceeds received in connection with the February Offering to approximately $80 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses. The Company used the net proceeds from the IPO for its working capital needs, to support revenue growth, increase inventory, meet customer demand forecasts, and support operational growth.\nConfidentially Marketed Public Offering\nOn December 16, 2022, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Canaccord Genuity LLC as the underwriter, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell an aggregate of 594,232 shares of its Common Stock, and, in lieu of Common Stock to certain investors that so chose, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants) to purchase 75,000 shares of our Common Stock, and accompanying warrants (the December 2022 Warrants) to purchase 1,338,462 shares of the Companys Common Stock (the Offering). The shares of Common Stock (or Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants) and the accompanying December 2022 Warrants will be issued separately but can only be purchased together in this Offering. Additional information regarding the Companys December 2022 Warrants may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures and Note 12 - Stockholders Equity, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe aggregate gross proceeds to the Company from the Offering were approximately $8.7 million including offering costs of approximately $0.5 million for broker fees and legal expenses, for net proceeds of $8.2 million. The Company has used the net proceeds from the Offering, together with its existing cash resources, for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and repayment of debt.\nNasdaq Deficiency Notice\nOn October 4, 2022, the Company received a deficiency letter from the Listing Qualifications Department (the Staff) of The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (Nasdaq) notifying the Company that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for the Companys Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain a continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Requirement). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of the Companys Common Stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercised its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G). On October 28, 2022, the Staff notified the Company that the closing bid price for its Common Stock was more than $1.00 for 10 consecutive trading days, and that the Company therefore regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement.\nOn January 19, 2023, the Company received a new deficiency letter from the Staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that, for the previous 30 consecutive business days, the bid price for its Common Stock had closed below $1.00 per share, which is the minimum closing price required to maintain a continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the Minimum Bid Requirement. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company had 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of the Companys Common Stock must be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G). On July 19, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq confirming its recompliance with the minimum bid price rule.\nAs disclosed in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 17, 2023, the Companys audit committee concluded that, as a result of inadvertent errors in the accounting for warrants previously issued by the Company, it was appropriate to restate the Companys previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements as of and for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2022, June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2022 included in the Companys Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods in amended quarterly reports for the affected periods. As a result of such restatements, the Company was unable to timely file the 2022 Form 10-K, the First Quarter 2023 Form 10-Q and the Second Quarter 2023 Form 10-Q without unreasonable effort or expense.\nOn April 18, 2023, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq (the April Nasdaq Notice) that it was noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of its failure to file its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the Form 10-K) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn May 17, 2023, the Company received a second notice from Nasdaq (the May Nasdaq Notice) that it remained noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of its failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023 (the First Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required due date.\nOn August 16, 2023, the Company received a third notice from Nasdaq that it remain noncompliant with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) as a result of its failure to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2023 (the Second Quarter Form 10-Q) with the SEC by the required filing date (the August Nasdaq Notice and, together with the April Nasdaq Notice and the May Nasdaq Notice, the Nasdaq Notices).\nThe Nasdaq granted the Company an exception until October 16, 2023, to file its 2022 Form 10-K and First and Second Quarter 2023 Forms 10-Q. The Nasdaq Notice had no immediate effect on the listing of the Companys common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC.\nOn October 17, 2023, the Company received a Staff Delisting Determination (the Staff Determination) from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq notifying the Company that it was not in compliance with Nasdaqs continued listing requirements under the Listing Rule as a result of its failure to file the First Quarter Form 10-Q, the Second Quarter Form 10-Q and the Form 10-K (collectively, the Delinquent Reports) in a timely manner.\nThe Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel), and the Panel scheduled a hearing for January 11, 2024. In connection with the hearing request, the Company requested that the stay be extended through the hearing and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Panel following the hearing. In that regard, pursuant to the Nasdaq Listing Rules, the Panel granted the additional extension period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance by the end of any additional extension period.\nThe Paycheck Protection Program\nIn May 2020, the Company received an unsecured Paycheck Protection Program Loan (PPP Loan) from the Bank of America pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program (the PPP) under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act), administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the SBA). The Company received total loan proceeds of approximately $779 thousand from the PPP Loan. On February 18, 2022, the Company applied for forgiveness of the outstanding balance of the PPP Loan and the application was denied by the SBA on March 18,2022. However, on June 23, 2022, the Company received a letter from Bank of America agreeing to extend the maturity date to May 7, 2025 and the loan will bear interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. The PPP loan is payable in 34 equal combined monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $24 thousand that commenced on August 7, 2022.\nIn July 2020, the Company received a separate PPP loan in the amount of $45,000. In September 2021, this loan was 100% forgiven by the SBA. The forgiveness of this loan is reflected in the 2021 Consolidated Statement of Operations as a gain on forgiveness.\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nAccounting for Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and include the accounts of Agrify Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, as described above, in accordance with the provisions required by the Consolidation Topic 810 of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). The Company includes results of operations of acquired companies from the date of acquisition. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated.\nAccounting for Less Than Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries\nFor the Companys less than wholly-owned subsidiaries, which include Teejan Podponics International LLC (TPI), Agrify-Valiant LLC (Agrify-Valiant), and Agrify Brands, LLC (Agrify Brands), the Company first analyzes whether these entities are a variable interest entity (a VIE) in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation (ASC 810), and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. A VIE is an entity that has (i) insufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or (ii) equity holders that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. The financial results of a VIE are consolidated by the primary beneficiary, which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could be significant to the entity. Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership or other financial interests in a VIE that change with changes in the fair value of the VIEs net assets. The Company continuously re-assesses (i) whether the joint-venture is a VIE, and (ii) if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. If it is determined that the joint-venture qualifies as a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Companys financial interest in the VIE is consolidated.\nBased on the Companys analysis of these entities, the Company has determined that Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands are each a VIE, and that the Company is the primary beneficiary. While the Company owns 60% of Agrify-Valiants equity interests and 75% of Agrify Brands equity interests, the remaining equity interests in Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands are owned by unrelated third parties, and the agreement with these third parties provides the Company with greater voting rights. Accordingly, the Company consolidates its interest in the financial statements of Agrify-Valiant and Agrify Brands under the VIE rules and reflects the third parties interests in the consolidated financial statements as a non-controlling interest. The Company records this non-controlling interest at its initial fair value, adjusting the basis prospectively for the third parties share of the respective consolidated investments net income or loss or equity contributions and distributions. These non-controlling interests are not redeemable by the equity holders and are presented as part of permanent equity. Income and losses are allocated to the non-controlling interest holders based on its economic ownership percentage. The investment in 50% of the shares of TPI is treated as an equity investment as the Company cannot exercise significant influence.\nGoing Concern\nIn accordance with the FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern, the Companys management evaluated whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the consolidated financial statements issuance date. The following matters raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.\nThe Company has incurred operating losses since its inception, has negative cash flows from operations and a working capital deficiency. The Company also has an accumulated deficit of approximately $247.1 million as of December 31, 2022. The Companys primary sources of liquidity are its cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, with additional liquidity accessible, subject to market conditions and other factors, including limitations that may apply to the Company under applicable SEC regulations, from the capital markets, including under its at-the-market continuous equity offering (ATM or ATM Program).\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had $20.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. The Companys restricted cash is associated with its senior secured note (the Exchange Note) and was $10.0 million as of December 31, 2022. Additional information regarding the Companys Exchange Note may be found in Note 9 - Debt, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company entered into the ATM Program with Canaccord Genuity LLC (the Agent) pursuant to which it may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, depending on market demand, with the Agent acting as an agent for sales. The ATM Program allowed the Company to sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to specific parameters defined by the Company as well as those defined by the SEC and the ATM Program agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company sold 306,628 shares of Common Stock under the ATM Program at an average price of $50.85 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $15.6 million, and net proceeds of $15.0 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $468 thousand and legal fees totaling $75 thousand. Subsequent to December 31, 2022 through April 1, 2023, after which time the ATM program was discontinued, the Company sold an additional 323,082 shares of Common Stock under the ATM at an average price of $4.93, resulting in gross proceeds of $1.6 million and net proceeds of $1.6 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $48 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the Investor under the Exchange Note. The Company used the net proceeds generated from the ATM Program for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding its transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts and capital expenditures. Due to the late filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is no longer eligible to utilize the registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the ATM Program.\nThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company believes these conditions raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within the next twelve-months from the date these consolidated financial statements are available to be issued. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until the Company begins generating sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations. If the Company is unable raise additional funds, it may be forced to cease operations.\nThere is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the potential future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include assumptions about collection of accounts and notes receivable, the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation expense, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, the valuation of inventory, and useful life of fixed assets and intangible assets. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, known trends and other market-specific information, other relevant factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, and managements judgement. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates when there are changes in circumstances, facts, and experience. Changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known. Actual financial results could differ from those estimates.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts in the Companys prior period consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the current period consolidated financial statements. In this Form 10-K, the Company has reclassified selling, general and administrative expenses to two separate line items in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nIn addition, the Company effected a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its Common Stock on October 18, 2022 and a 1-for-20 reverse stock split of its Common Stock on July 5, 2023. All share and per share information has been retroactively adjusted to give effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated. The shares of Common Stock retained a par value of $0.001 per share. Accordingly, the Stockholders equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects the reverse stock split by reclassifying from Common Stock to Additional paid-in capital an amount equal to the par value of the decreased shares resulting from the reverse stock split.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consists principally of cash and deposits with maturities of three months or less as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. All cash equivalents are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Restricted cash represents cash required to be held as collateral for the Companys Notes. Accordingly, these balances contain restrictions as to their availability and usage and are classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets. Additional information relating to the Companys Notes may be found in Note 9 - Debt, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Companys marketable security investments primarily include investments held in mutual funds, municipal bonds, and corporate bonds. The mutual funds are recorded at fair value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as part of cash and cash equivalents. The municipal and corporate bonds are considered to be held-to-maturity securities and are recorded at amortized cost in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of these investments was estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. The Company considers current assets to be those investments that will mature within the next 12 months, including interest receivable on long-term bonds.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net, primarily consists of amounts for goods and services that are billed and currently due from customers. Accounts receivable balances are presented net of an allowance for credit losses, which is an estimate of billed amounts that may not be collectible. In determining the amount of the allowance at each reporting date, management makes judgments about general economic conditions, historical write-off experience, and any specific risks identified in customer collection matters, including the aging of unpaid accounts receivable and changes in customer financial conditions. Accounts receivable balances are written off after all means of collection are exhausted and the potential for non-recovery is determined to be probable. Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are recorded as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nConcentration of Credit Risk and Significant Customer\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to a concentration of credit risk primarily consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents primarily consist of money market funds with original maturities of three months or less, which are invested primarily with U.S. financial institutions. Cash deposits with financial institutions, including restricted cash, generally exceed federally insured limits. Management believes minimal credit risk exists with respect to these financial institutions and the Company has not experienced any losses on such amounts.\nThe tables below show customers who account for 10% or more of the Companys total revenues and 10% or more of the Companys accounts receivable for the periods presented.\nRevenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Companys customers that accounted for 10% or more of the total revenue were as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2022 Year Ended\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In thousands) Amount %\nof Total\nRevenue Amount %\nof Total\nRevenue\nNew England Innovation Academy (NEIA) - Related Party * * $ 22,010 36.8 %\nGreenstone Holdings (Greenstone) - Greenstone is a related party because one of the Companys former Agrify Brands employees and its VP of Engineering had a minority ownership * * $ 9,429 15.8 %\nCompany Customer Number - 136 $ 8,005 13.8 % * *\nCompany Customer Number - 139 $ 8,761 15.0 % * *\n* Customer revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was less than 10%\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Companys customers that accounted for 10% or more of the total accounts receivable, net, were as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2022 As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In thousands) Amount % of\nTotal\nAccounts\nReceivable Amount % of\nTotal\nAccounts\nReceivable\nNEIA - Related Party * * $ 3,498 48.4 %\nCompany Customer Number - 126 (1) * * $ 1,541 21.3 %\nCompany Customer Number - 15095 $ 352 32.9 % * *\nCompany Customer Number - 10888 $ 251 23.5 % * *\nCompany Customer Number - 16491 $ 123 11.5 % * *\n* Customer accounts receivable balance, as a percentage of total accounts receivable balance, was less than 10%\n(1) The accounts receivable balance was fully reserved at December 31, 2022 due to an ongoing dispute with the customer.\nInventories\nThe Company values all its inventories, which consist primarily of significant raw material hardware components, at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined by the weighted-average cost method on a first-in, first-out basis. Write-offs of potentially slow-moving or damaged inventory are recorded through specific identification of obsolete or damaged material. The Company takes physical inventory at least once annually at all inventory locations.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of each asset, as follows:\nEstimated Useful\nLife\n(Years)\nComputer and office equipment 2 to 3\nFurniture and fixtures\nSoftware\nVehicles\nResearch and development laboratory equipment\nMachinery and equipment 3 to 5\nLeased equipment 5 to 13\nTrade show assets 3 to 5\nLeasehold improvements Lower of estimated useful\nlife or remaining\nlease term\nThe estimated useful lives of the Companys property and equipment are periodically assessed to determine if changes are appropriate. The Company charges maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred. When the Company retires or disposes of assets, the carrying cost of these assets and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are eliminated from the consolidated balance sheet and any resulting gain or loss are included in the consolidated statements of operations in the period of retirement or disposal.\nCosts for capital assets not yet placed into service are capitalized as construction-in-progress and depreciated once placed into service. During construction, costs are accumulated in a construction-in-progress account, with no depreciation. Upon completion, costs are transferred to the appropriate asset account, and depreciation begins when the asset is placed into service.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is defined as the excess of cost over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The Company has determined that it is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting the goodwill impairment assessment. A goodwill impairment charge is recorded if the amount by which the Companys carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Factors that could lead to a future impairment include material uncertainties such as a significant reduction in projected revenues, a deterioration of projected financial performance, future acquisitions and/or mergers, and/or a decline in the Companys market value as a result of a significant decline in the Companys stock price.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in the Companys stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, the Company deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of its property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022.\nBased on its interim testing, the Company noted that the carrying value of equity exceeded the calculated fair value by an amount greater than the aggregate value of our goodwill. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the entire carrying value of its goodwill was impaired, resulting in a second-quarter impairment charge of $54.7 million. Additional information regarding the Companys interim testing on goodwill may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company initially records intangible assets at their estimated fair values and reviews these assets periodically for impairment. Identifiable intangible assets, which consist principally of customer-related acquired assets, acquired and/or developed technology, non-compete agreements, and trade names, are reported net of accumulated amortization, and are being amortized over their estimated useful lives at amortization rates that are proportional to each assets estimated economic benefit. The Companys intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company reviews the carrying value of these intangible assets annually, or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present.\nThe useful lives are as follows:\nTrade names 5 to 7 years\nAcquired developed technology 5 to 8 years\nNon-compete agreements 5 years\nCustomer relationships 5 to 8 years\nCapitalized website costs 3 to 5 years\nIn performing the review of the recoverability of intangible assets, the Company considers several factors, including whether there have been significant changes in legal factors or the overall business climate that could affect the underlying value of an asset. The Company also considers whether there is an expectation that the asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its remaining estimated useful life. If, as the result of examining any of these factors, the Company concludes that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge and reduces the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in the Companys stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, the Company deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of its property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022.\nBased on its interim testing, the Company noted that the carrying value of equity exceeded the calculated fair value by an amount greater than the aggregate value of our intangible assets. Accordingly, the Company concluded that the entire carrying value of its intangible assets should be impaired, resulting in a second-quarter impairment charge of $15.2 million. Additional information regarding the Companys interim testing on intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nThe Company evaluates its convertible instruments to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivative financial instruments to be separately accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company identify and record certain ECOs, certain variable-share settlement features, and any related freestanding instruments at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreement and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. Any change in fair value is recorded as non-operating, non-cash income or expense for each reporting period at each balance sheet date. The Company reassesses the classification of its derivative instruments at each balance sheet date. If the classification changes as a result of events during the period, the contract is reclassified as of the date of the event that caused the reclassification. Bifurcated embedded conversion options, variable-share settlement features, and any related freestanding instruments are recorded as a discount to the host instrument which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective note using the effective interest method.\nIf the Company determines that an instrument is not a derivative liability, it then evaluates whether there is a BCF, by comparing the commitment date fair value to the effective current conversion price of the instrument. The Company records a BCF as a debt discount which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the respective note using the effective interest method. BCFs that are contingent upon the occurrence of a future event are recognized when the contingency is resolved. Additionally, adoption of ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating the cash conversion and the BCF accounting models for convertible debt and convertible preferred stock.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all its financial instruments, including issued private placement stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815. The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480 and ASC 815. Managements assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own Common Stock among other conditions for equity classification.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, they are recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that are precluded from equity classification, they are recorded as a liability at their initial fair value on the date of issuance and subject to remeasurement on each balance sheet date with changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants to be recognized as an unrealized gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company reached an agreement with its institutional lender to amend its existing Securities Purchase Agreement and entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the August 2022 Exchange Agreement). Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, the Company issued a new warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock (the Note Exchange Warrant) and modified an existing warrant (the SPA Warrant) to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock. The Company exchanged the SPA Warrant for a new warrant for the same number of underlying shares but with a reduced exercise price (the Modified Warrants and, collectively with the Note Exchange Warrant, the August 2022 Warrants). Additional information regarding the August 2022 Exchange Agreement and August 2022 Warrants may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures and Note 9 - Debt, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Issuance Costs and Debt Discount\nThe Company may record debt issuance costs and/or debt discounts in connection with the issuance of debt. The Company may cover these costs by paying cash or issuing warrants. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the expected life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.\nOriginal Issue Discount\nCertain convertible debt issued by the Company may provide the debt holder with an original issue discount. The Company would record the original issue discount to debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note, and is then amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.\nLeases\nThe Company determines at the inception of an asset contract if such arrangement is or contains a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company classifies leases at the lease commencement date as operating or finance leases and records a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on its consolidated balance sheet for all leases with an initial lease term of greater than 12 months. A lease with an initial term of 12 months or less is not recorded on the balance sheet, but related payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Companys asset contracts may contain both lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components may include maintenance, utilities, and other operating costs. The Company combines the lease and non-lease components of fixed costs in its lease arrangements as a single lease component. Variable costs, such as utilities or maintenance costs, are not included in the measurement of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, but rather are expensed when the event determining the amount of variable consideration to be paid occurs.\nLease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of future lease payments over the expected lease term. The Company determines the present value of future lease payments by using its estimated secured incremental borrowing rate for that lease term as the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. The Company estimates its secured incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over a similar term.\nCertain of the Companys leases include options to extend or terminate the lease. The amounts determined for the Companys right-of-use assets and lease liabilities generally do not assume that renewal options or early-termination provisions, if any, are exercised unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenue includes amounts collected or billed in excess of revenue that the Company can recognize. The Company recognizes deferred revenue and non-current deferred revenue as revenue as the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Company records deferred revenue that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses. The estimated fair values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company measures all stock options and other stock-based awards granted to employees, directors, and consultants, based on the fair value on the date of the grant and recognizes compensation expense of those awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Historically, the Company has issued stock options to employees, directors, and consultants with only service-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method.\nThe Company classifies stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipients payroll costs are classified.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each stock option grant on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Before the IPO, the Company was a private company and therefore lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock volatility based on the historical volatility of similar publicly-traded companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Companys stock options has been determined utilizing the simplified method for awards that qualify as plain-vanilla options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. The expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting, in accordance with which assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. The fair value of the consideration paid, including contingent consideration, is assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe Companys management exercises significant judgments in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as intangibles and their estimated useful lives. Fair value and useful life determinations are based on, among other factors, estimates of future expected cash flows, royalty cost savings, and appropriate discount rates used in computing present values. These judgments may materially impact the estimates used in allocating acquisition date fair values to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the Companys current and future operating results. Actual results may vary from these estimates, which may result in adjustments to goodwill and acquisition date fair values of assets and liabilities during a measurement period or upon a final determination of asset and liability fair values, whichever occurs first. Adjustments to the fair value of assets and liabilities made after the end of the measurement period are recorded within the Companys operating results.\nFor contingent consideration arrangements, the Company recognizes a liability at fair value as of the acquisition date with subsequent fair value adjustments recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Additional information regarding the Companys contingent consideration arrangements may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOverview\nThe Company generates revenue from the following sources: (1) equipment sales, (2) providing services and (3) construction contracts.\nIn accordance with ASC 606 Revenue Recognition, the Company recognizes revenue from contracts with customers using a five-step model, which is described below:\n\u25cf identify the customer contract;\n\u25cf identify performance obligations that are distinct;\n\u25cf determine the transaction price;\n\u25cf allocate the transaction price to the distinct performance obligations; and\n\u25cf recognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nIdentify the customer contract\nA customer contract is generally identified when there is approval and commitment from both the Company and its customer, the rights have been identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability is probable. Specifically, the Company obtains written/electronic signatures on contracts and purchase orders, if said purchase orders are issued in the normal course of business by the customer.\nIdentify performance obligations that are distinct\nA performance obligation is a promise by the Company to provide a distinct good or service or a series of distinct goods or services. A good or service that is promised to a customer is distinct if the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer, and a companys promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.\nDetermine the transaction price\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, excluding sales taxes that are collected on behalf of government agencies.\nAllocate the transaction price to distinct performance obligations\nThe transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of the goods or services being provided to the customer. The Companys contracts typically contain multiple performance obligations, for which the Company accounts for individual performance obligations separately, if they are distinct. The standalone selling price reflects the price the Company would charge for a specific piece of equipment or service if it was sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers.\nRecognize revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of a promised product or service to a customer.\nSignificant Judgments\nThe Company enters into contracts that may include various combinations of equipment, services, and construction, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. Once the Company determines the performance obligations, it determines the transaction price, which includes estimating the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price, if any. The Company then allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract based on the SSP. The corresponding revenue is recognized as the related performance obligations are satisfied.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. The Company determines SSP based on the price at which the performance obligation is sold separately and the methods of estimating SSP under the guidance of ASC 606-10-32-33. If the SSP is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the SSP, taking into account available information such as market conditions, expected margins, and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations. The Company licenses its SaaS type subscription license, whereby the customer only has a right to access the software over a specified time period. The full value of the contract is recognized ratably over the contractual term of the SaaS subscription, adjusted monthly if tiered pricing is relevant. The Company typically satisfies its performance obligations for equipment sales when equipment is made available for shipment to the customer; for services sales as services are rendered to the customer and for construction contracts both as services are rendered and when the contract is completed.\nThe Company utilizes the cost-plus margin method to determine the SSP for equipment and build-out services. This method is based on the cost of the services from third parties, plus a reasonable markup that the Company believes is reflective of a market-based reseller margin.\nThe Company determines the SSP for services in time and materials contracts by observable prices in standalone services arrangements.\nThe Company estimates variable consideration in the form of royalties, revenue share, monthly fees, and service credits at contract inception and it is updated at the end of each reporting period if additional information becomes available. Variable consideration is typically not subject to constraint. Changes to variable consideration were not material for the periods presented.\nIf a contract has payment terms that differ from the timing of revenue recognition, the Company will assess whether the transaction price for those contracts include a significant financing component. The Company has elected the practical expedient that permits an entity to not adjust for the effects of a significant financing component if the Company expects that at the contract inception, the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service, will be one year or less. For those contracts in which the period exceeds the one-year threshold, this assessment, as well as the quantitative estimate of the financing component and its relative significance, requires judgment. Accordingly, the Company imputes interest on such contracts at an agreed-upon interest rate and will present the financing components separately as financial income. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any such financial income.\nPayment terms with customers typically require payment 30 days from the invoice date. The Companys agreements with its customers do not provide for any refunds for services or products and therefore no specific reserve for such is maintained. In the infrequent instances where customers raise concern over delivered products or services, the Company has endeavored to remedy the concern and all costs related to such matters have been insignificant in all periods presented.\nThe Company has elected to treat shipping and handling activities after the customer obtains control of the goods as a fulfillment cost and not as a promised good or service. Accordingly, the Company will accrue all fulfillment costs related to the shipping and handling of consumer goods at the time of shipment. The Company has payment terms with its customers of one year or less and has elected the practical expedient applicable to such contracts not to consider the time value of money. Sales, value add, and other taxes the Company collects concurrent with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company receives payment from customers based on specified terms that are generally less than 30 days from the satisfaction of performance obligations. There are no contract assets related to performance under the contract. The difference in the opening and closing balances of the Companys deferred revenue primarily results from the timing difference between the Companys performance and the customers payment. The Company fulfills obligations under a contract with a customer by transferring products and services in exchange for consideration from the customer. Accounts receivable are recorded when the customer has been billed or the right to consideration is unconditional. The Company recognizes deferred revenue when consideration has been received or an amount of consideration is due from the customer, and the Company has a future obligation to transfer certain proprietary products.\nIn accordance with ASC 606-10-50-13, the Company is required to include disclosure on its remaining performance obligations as of the end of the current reporting period. Due to the nature of the Companys contracts, these reporting requirements are not applicable. The majority of the Companys remaining contracts meet certain exemptions as defined in ASC 606-10-50-14 through 606-10-50-14A, including (i) performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) the right to invoice practical expedient.\nThe Company generally provides a one-year warranty on its products for materials and workmanship but may provide multiple year warranties as negotiated, and generally transfers to its customers the warranties it receives from its vendors, if any, which generally cover this one-year period. In accordance with ASC 450-20-25, the Company accrues for product warranties when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company maintains a reserve for warranty returns of $553 thousand and $398 thousand for December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Companys reserve for warranty returns is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. Additional information regarding the Companys warranty reserve may be found in Note 3 - Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet Information, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nResearch and Development Costs\nThe Company expenses research and development costs as incurred. Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other expenses associated with product development. The Company incurs research and development costs associated with the development and enhancement of both hardware and software products associated with its cultivation and extraction equipment, as well as its SaaS-based software offering, Agrify Insights\u2122 cultivation software (Agrify Insights\u2122).\nCapitalization of Internal Software Development Costs\nThe Company capitalizes certain software engineering efforts related to the continued development of Agrify Insights\u2122 under ASC 985-20. Costs incurred during the application development phase are only capitalized once technical feasibility has been established and the work performed will result in new or additional functionality. The types of costs capitalized during the application development phase include employee compensation, as well as consulting fees for third-party software developers working on these projects. Costs related to the research and development are expensed as incurred until technical feasibility is established, as well as post-implementation activities. Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset, which ranges from two to five years.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires, among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nWhen tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10-25-6, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2022, tax years 2017 through 2021 remain open for audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The Company has received no notice of audit from the IRS for any of the open tax years.\nThe Company recognizes the benefit of a tax position when it is effectively settled. ASC 740-10-25-10, Basic Recognition Threshold provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. ASC 740-10-25-10 clarifies that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority. For tax positions considered effectively settled, the Company recognizes the full amount of the tax benefit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $25 thousand, comprised of its change in deferred tax liability during the year related to its indefinite-lived intangible asset balance. The indefinite-lived intangibles are not all available as a source of income and thus are not fully available to offset the Companys deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of approximately $96.7 million and $71.6 million, respectively. There was no federal income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 due to the Companys net losses.\nNet Loss Per Share\nThe Company presents basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders in conformity with the two-class method required for participating securities. The Company computes basic loss per share by dividing net loss available to Common Stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Net loss available to Common Stockholders represents net loss attributable to Common Stockholders reduced by the allocation of earnings to participating securities. Losses are not allocated to participating securities as the holders of the participating securities do not have a contractual obligation to share in any losses. Diluted loss per share adjusts basic loss per share for the potentially dilutive impact of stock options and warrants. As the Company has reported losses for all periods presented, all potentially dilutive securities including stock options and warrants, are anti-dilutive, and accordingly, basic net loss per share equals diluted net loss per share.\nNet loss per share calculations for all periods have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock splits effected on January 12, 2021, October 18, 2022 and July 5, 2023. Net loss per share was calculated based on the weighted-average number of Common Stock outstanding.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity. The amendments in ASU No. 2020-06 simplify the complexity associated with applying GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. More specifically, the amendments focus on the guidance for convertible instruments and derivative scope exceptions for contracts in an entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this new accounting guidance had no impact on the Companys consolidated financial position.\nPending Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which introduces a new methodology for accounting for credit losses on financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities and accounts receivable. The guidance establishes a new expected loss model that requires entities to estimate current expected credit losses on financial instruments by using all practical and relevant information. Any expected credit losses are to be reflected as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company does not expect that the application of ASU No. 2016-13 will have a material impact on the presentation of its results of operations, financial position, or disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 606): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires that an entity recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606 as if it had originated the contracts. Generally, this should result in an acquirer recognizing and measuring the acquired contract assets and contract liabilities consistent with how they were recognized and measured in the acquirees financial statements, if the acquiree prepared financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The amendment in this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect that the application of ASU 2021-08 will have a material impact on the presentation of its results of operations, financial position, or disclosures.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Companys present or future consolidated financial statements.\nNote 2 - Revenue and Deferred Revenue\nRevenue\nThe Company sells its equipment and services to customers under a combination of a contract and purchase order. Equipment revenue includes sales from proprietary products designed and engineered by the Company such as Agrify Vertical Farming Units (VFUs), container farms, integrated grow racks, and LED grow lights, and non-proprietary products designed, engineered, and manufactured by third parties such as air cleaning systems and pesticide-free surface protection.\nConstruction contracts normally provide for payment upon completion of specified work or units of work as identified in the contract. Although there is considerable variation in the terms of these contracts, they are primarily structured as time-and-material contracts. The Company enters into time-and-materials contracts under which the Company is paid for labor and equipment at negotiated hourly billing rates and other expenses, including materials, as incurred at rates agreed to in the contract. The Company uses three main sub-contractors to execute the construction contracts.\nThe following table provides the Companys revenue disaggregated by the timing of revenue recognition:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nTransferred at a point in time $ 34,813 $ 23,624\nTransferred over time 23,446 36,235\nTotal revenue $ 58,259 $ 59,859\nThe following table provides the Companys revenue disaggregated by revenue type:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nCultivation solutions, including ancillary products and services $ 711 $ 11,354\nAgrify Insights\u2122\nFacility build-outs 23,129 36,193\nExtraction solutions 34,345 12,304\nTotal revenue $ 58,259 $ 59,859\nIn accordance with ASC 606-10-50-13, the Company is required to include disclosure on its remaining performance obligations as of the end of the current reporting period. Due to the nature of the Companys contracts, these reporting requirements are not applicable, because the majority of the Companys remaining contracts meet certain exemptions as defined in ASC 606-10-50-14 through 606-10-50-14A, including (i) performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (ii) the right to invoice practical expedient.\nDeferred Revenue\nChanges in the Companys current deferred revenue balance for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nDeferred revenue - beginning of period $ 3,772 $ 152\nAdditions 13,392 3,762\nRecognized (13,052 ) (142 )\nDeferred revenue - end of period $ 4,112 $ 3,772\nDeferred revenue balances primarily consist of customer deposits on the Companys cultivation and extraction solutions equipment. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, all of the Companys deferred revenue balances were reported as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $2.7 million of revenue that was deferred during 2021. And, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $120 thousand of revenue that was deferred during 2020.\nNote 3 - Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet Information\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nAccounts receivable, gross $ 5,675 $ 8,637\nLess allowance for doubtful accounts (4,605 ) (1,415 )\nAccounts receivable, net $ 1,070 $ 7,222\nNEIA, a related party, accounted for $3 thousand and $3.5 million of the Companys accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts consisted of the following:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - beginning of period $ 1,415 $ 54\nProvision for doubtful accounts 3,418 1,187\nOther adjustments (228 )\nAllowance for doubtful accounts - end of period $ 4,605 $ 1,415\nBad debt expense was $3.4 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nOther receivables $ 424 $ 86\nPrepaid expenses, other\nPrepaid insurance\nDeferred issuance costs -\nPrepaid software\nPrepaid materials -\nOther note receivables (1) -\nDeferred costs -\nTotal prepaid expenses and other current assets $ 1,510 $ 2,452\n(1) Other note receivables relate to the current portion of one of its loan receivable balances related to the total turn-key solution (TTK Solution) program.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nLeasehold improvements $ 1,111 $ 841\nMachinery and equipment 1,049\nSoftware\nComputer and office equipment\nLeased equipment\nFurniture and fixtures\nResearch and development laboratory equipment\nVehicles\nTrade show assets\nTotal property and equipment, gross 4,973 3,776\nAccumulated depreciation (2,372 ) (780 )\nConstruction in progress 7,443 3,236\nTotal property and equipment, net $ 10,044 $ 6,232\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $1.7 million and $655 thousand, respectively.\nOther Non-Current Assets\nOther non-current assets consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nLong-term deferred commissions expense $ 173 1,101\nSecurity deposits\nTotal other non-current assets $ 326 $ 1,184\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nSales tax payable (1) $ 5,950 $ 5,290\nAccrued acquisition liabilities (2) 3,502 9,198\nAccrued construction costs 2,669 8,803\nCompensation related fees 2,285 3,491\nAccrued inventory purchases\nAccrued warranty costs\nAccrued professional fees 1,179\nAccrued interest expense -\nFinancing lease liabilities\nOther current liabilities\nTotal accrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 16,380 $ 28,764\n(1) Sales tax payable primarily represents identified sales and use tax liabilities arising from the acquisition of Precision and Cascade.

In determining fair value, the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability (the inputs) are based on a tiered fair value hierarchy consisting of three levels, as follows:\nLevel 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2: Other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or for similar markets that are not active.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data which require the Company to develop its own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability.\nValuation techniques for assets and liabilities include methodologies such as the market approach, the income approach, or the cost approach, and may use unobservable inputs such as projections, estimates, and managements interpretation of current market data. These unobservable inputs are only utilized to the extent that observable inputs are not available or cost-effective to obtain.\nAt December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Companys assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2022 December 31, 2021\nFair Value Measurements Using Input Types Fair Value Measurements Using Input Types\n(In thousands) Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nLevel 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets\nMutual funds (included in cash and cash equivalents in 2021) $ 33 $ -\n$ -\n$ 33 $ 178 $ -\n$ -\n$ 178\nMunicipal bonds -\n-\n-\n-\n9,961 -\n-\n9,961\nCorporate bonds -\n-\n34,589 -\n-\n34,589\nTotal assets $ 460 $ -\n$ -\n$ 460 $ 44,728 $ -\n$ -\n$ 44,728\nLiabilities\nContingent consideration $ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 6,137 $ 6,137\nWarrant Liabilities - January 2022 Warrants -\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nWarrant Liabilities - March 2022 Warrants -\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nWarrant Liabilities - August 2022 Warrants -\n-\n-\n-\n-\n-\nWarrant Liabilities - December 2022 Warrants -\n-\n5,854 5,854 -\n-\n-\n-\nTotal liabilities $ -\n$ -\n$ 5,985 $ 5,985 $ -\n$ -\n$ 6,137 $ 6,137\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company has certain financial instruments which consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, warrant liabilities, and contingent consideration. Fair value information for each of these instruments as well as other balances of the Company are as follows:\n\u25cf Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue liabilities approximate their fair values based on the short-term nature of these instruments.\n\u25cf Marketable securities classified as current held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost, which at December 31, 2022, approximated fair value.\n\u25cf The Companys deferred consideration was recorded in connection with acquisitions during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and the first quarter of fiscal 2022 using an estimated fair value discount at the time of the transactions. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the carrying value of the deferred consideration approximated fair value.\n\u25cf The Companys warrant liabilities are marked-to-market each reporting period with the changes in fair value of warrant liabilities recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations until the warrants are exercised. The fair value of the warrant liabilities are estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nMarketable Securities\nAs of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company held investments in municipal bonds and corporate bonds. The municipal and corporate bonds are considered held-to-maturity securities and are recorded at amortized cost in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of these investments were estimated using recently executed transactions and market price quotations. The Company considers current assets as those investments which will mature within the next 12 months including interest receivable on long-term bonds.\nThe composition of the Companys marketable securities are as follows:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nCurrent marketable securities\nMunicipal bonds $ -\n$ 9,961\nCorporate bonds 34,589\nMutual funds -\n$ 460 $ 44,550\nAt December 31, 2022, marketable securities consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) Amortized\ncost Unrealized\ngain (loss) Estimated\nfair value\nCurrent marketable securities (due within 1 year)\nCorporate bonds $ 427 $ -\n$ 427\nMutual funds -\n$ 460 $ -\n$ 460\nAt December 31, 2021, marketable securities consisted of the following:\n(In thousands) Amortized\ncost Unrealized\nloss Estimated\nfair value\nCurrent marketable securities (due within 1 year)\nMunicipal bonds $ 9,961 $ (9 ) $ 9,952\nCorporate bonds 34,589 (72 ) 34,517\n$ 44,550 $ (81 ) $ 44,469\nContingent Consideration\nThe Company has classified its net liability for contingent earn-out considerations to the sellers relating to one acquisition completed during the first quarter of 2022 and two acquisitions completed during fiscal 2021. The fair value for the contingent consideration associated with these acquisitions is within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the associated fair value is determined using significant unobservable inputs, which included the key assumptions to model future revenue, costs of goods sold, and operating expense projections. A description of the Companys acquisitions completed during the first quarter of 2022 and fiscal 2021 are included within Note 8 - Business Combinations, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nContingent consideration - beginning of period $ 6,137 $ -\nAccrued contingent consideration 1,420 4,725\nAccretion of contingent consideration -\nCash paid and Common Stock issued for contingent liabilities (5,550 ) -\nChange in estimated fair value (2,156 ) 1,412\nContingent consideration - end of period $ -\n$ 6,137\nThe Company included contingent consideration within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nSee below for additional information related to each acquisitions contingent consideration.\nContingent Consideration - PurePressure\nThe Company, in its review of actual revenue performance as compared to its originally projected revenue estimates, noted that PurePressures revenue trend is materially below the originally estimated revenue trends incorporated into the Companys original fair value estimates at the time of the acquisition. As a result, the Company has reduced its fair value estimate of achievement for PurePressures first earn-out period. During the third quarter ended September 30, 2022, the Company reduced the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with PurePressures first earn-out period by approximately $602 thousand and their second earn-out by approximately $170 thousand. As required by ASC Topic 805 Business Combination (ASC 805), the change in contingent consideration was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses during the third and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively.\nContingent Consideration - Lab Society\nThe Company, in its review of actual revenue performance as compared to its originally projected revenue estimates, noted that Lab Societys revenue trend is materially below the originally estimated revenue trends incorporated into the Companys original fair value estimates at the time of the acquisition. As a result, the Company has reduced its fair value estimate of achievement for Lab Societys first earn-out period. During the second quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company reduced the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability associated with Lab Societys first earn-out period by approximately $1.0 million and their second earn-out by approximately $484 thousand. As required by ASC 805, the change in contingent consideration was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses during the second and fourth quarters of 2022, respectively.\nContingent Consideration - Precision and Cascade\nThe earn-out period for the potential contingent consideration to be earned by the former members of Precision and Cascade concluded on December 31, 2021. The Company, during the second quarter of 2022, increased the amount of the contingent consideration earned by the former members of Precision and Cascade by approximately $121 thousand to reflect the final contingent consideration amount due. This amount was recorded as an increase in operating expenses during the second quarter of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made the final payment on the contingent consideration of approximately $5.6 million to the members of Precision and Cascade. Additional information regarding the Companys final payment to Precision and Cascade may be found in Note 8 - Business Combinations, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWarrant Liabilities\nThe estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities on December 31, 2022 is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Black-Scholes option-pricing model are assumptions used in calculating the estimated fair values that represent the Companys best estimate. The volatility rate is determined utilizing the Companys own share price and the share price of competitors over time.\nHowever, inherent uncertainties are involved. If factors or assumptions change, the estimated fair values could be materially different.\nJanuary 2022 Warrants\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assumptions used in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nStock price $ 6.66\nOption exercise price $ 1,496.00\nExpected term (Years) 4.58\nVolatility 98.3 %\nDiscount rate (Treasury yield) 4.05 %\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n(In thousands) Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nWarrant liabilities - beginning of period $ -\nInitial fair value of warrant liabilities 10,969\nChange in estimated fair value (10,965 )\nWarrant liabilities - end of period $ 4\nMarch 2022 Warrants\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assumptions used in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nStock price $ 6.66\nOption exercise price $ 430.00\nExpected term (Years) 5.13\nVolatility 97.96 %\nDiscount rate (Treasury yield) 3.99 %\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n(In thousands)\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nWarrant liabilities - beginning of period\n$ -\nInitial fair value of warrant liabilities\n29,522\nChange in estimated fair value\n(31,133 )\nComponent of loss on debt extinguishment\n1,645\nWarrant liabilities - end of period\n$\nAugust 2022 Warrants\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assumptions used in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nStock price\n$ 6.66\nOption exercise price\n$ 246.00\nExpected term (Years)\n5.13\nVolatility\n97.96 %\nDiscount rate (Treasury yield)\n3.99 %\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n(In thousands) Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nWarrant liabilities - beginning of period $ -\nInitial fair value of warrant liabilities 10,212\nChange in estimated fair value (9,876 )\nWarrants settled in period (243 )\nWarrant liabilities - end of period $ 93\nDecember 2022 Warrants\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assumptions used in the valuation for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nStock price $ 6.66\nOption exercise price $ 13.00\nExpected term (Years) 4.98\nVolatility 98.00 %\nDiscount rate (Treasury yield) 3.99 %\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in the fair value of the Level 3 warrant liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022:\n(In thousands) Year Ended\nDecember 31,\nWarrant liabilities - beginning of period $ -\nInitial fair value of warrant liabilities 4,924\nChange in estimated fair value\nWarrant liabilities - end of period $ 5,854\nNote 5 - Loans Receivable\nA portion of the capital raised from the Companys IPO was allocated to launch the Companys TTK Solution program. The TTK Solution is the industrys first-of-its-kind program in which the Company engages with qualified cannabis operators in the early phases of their business plans and provides critical support, typically over a 10-year period, which includes: access to capital for construction costs, the design and build-out of their cultivation and extraction facilities, state-of-the-art cultivation and extraction equipment, subscription to the Companys Agrify Insights\u2122, process design, training, implementation, proven grow recipes, product formulations, data analytics, and consumer branding.\nThe Company recorded $11.3 million in loan reserves during the fourth quarter of 2022, related to three customer balances that were fully or partially reserved.\nOn September 15, 2022, the Company provided a notice of default under the term loan agreement between the Company and Bud & Marys (the Bud & Marys TTK Agreement). On October 5, 2022, Bud & Marys Cultivation, Inc. (the Bud & Marys) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Suffolk County naming the Company as defendant. Bud & Marys is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract and conversion arising from the Bud & Marys TTK Agreement. In response, the Company established a reserve of $14.7 million specifically related to Bud & Marys. The Company deemed it necessary to fully reserve the $14.7 million outstanding balance in the third quarter of 2022 due to the litigation and the uncertainty of the customers ability to repay the outstanding balance. The Company believes that Bud & Marys claims have no merit and intends to defend itself vigorously. The Company is taking all necessary steps to pursue repayment from Bud & Marys and is taking all actions necessary to protect its shareholders interests.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company established a reserve of approximately $12.5 million specifically related to Greenstone. Greenstone is a related party because one of the Companys former Agrify Brands employees and its VP of Engineering had a minority ownership. The Company established the reserve based upon its review of Greenstones financial stability, which would impact collectability, which is primarily the result of unfavorable market conditions within the Colorado market. The Company will continue to monitor the operations of Greenstone in an effort to collect all outstanding receivables, but due to the uncertain nature of Greenstones business at this time the Company has made the decision to place a reserve against the receivables. Greenstone is a related party as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.\nThe breakdown of loans receivable by customer as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nBud & Marys - TTK Solution $ 14,691 $ 5,542\nGreenstone - TTK Solution - Greenstone is a related party because one of the Companys former Agrify Brands employees and its VP of Engineering had a minority ownership 12,457 11,177\nCompany Customer Number 136 - TTK Solution 9,048 2,439\nCompany Customer Number 125 - TTK Solution 5,890 1,105\nCompany Customer Number 71 - Non-TTK Solution (1) 3,178 1,946\nCompany Customer Number 140 - TTK Solution (2) -\nTTK Solution - Allowance for doubtful accounts (3) (33,050 ) -\nTotal loan receivable $ 12,214 $ 22,255\n(1) The current portion of loan receivable is included within Note 3 - Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet Information, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n(2) The balance was written off at December 31, 2022 due to the cancellation of this TTK Solution project.\n(3) The Company established an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately $14.7 million related to Bud & Marys ongoing litigation. Approximately $12.5 million relates to Greenstone, which is a related party because one of the Companys former Agrify Brands employees and its VP of Engineering had a minority ownership, consisting of capital advances, accrued interest, and VFUs sales. Approximately $4.5 million relates to Hannah, and $1.4 million relates to WhiteCloud.\nAt this time, the Company is not aware of, nor has it identified any risk or potential performance failure associated with any of its TTK Solution arrangements, other than the noted exceptions of Bud & Marys TTK Solution and Greenstone TTK Solution, which is a related party, as described above.\nThe Company analyzed whether any of the above customers are a VIE in accordance with ASC 810 and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation. Based on the Companys analysis, the Company has determined that Greenstone, which is a related party because one of the Companys former Agrify Brands employees and its VP of Engineering had a minority ownership, is a VIE. As of December 31, 2022, two of the Companys employees own approximately 36.6% of the equity of Greenstone, however, since the Company is not the primary beneficiary and does not hold significant influence over Greenstone business decisions, the Company is not required to consolidate Greenstone.\nNote 6 - Inventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost principally determined by the weighted-average cost method on a first-in, first-out basis. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and operating supplies. The Companys standard payment terms with suppliers may require making payments in advance of delivery of the Companys products. The Companys prepaid inventory is a short-term, non-interest-bearing asset that is applied to the purchase of products once they are delivered.\nInventory consisted of the following as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 as follows:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nRaw materials $ 24,960 $ 6,393\nPrepaid inventory 15,506 2,237\nFinished goods 13,352 12,810\nInventory, gross 53,818 21,440\nInventory reserves (32,422 ) (942 )\nTotal inventory, net $ 21,396 $ 20,498\nInventory Reserves\nThe Company establishes an inventory reserve for obsolete, slow-moving, and defective inventory. The Company calculates inventory reserves for obsolete, slow-moving, or defective items as the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated net realizable value. The reserves are based upon managements expected method of disposition.\nChanges in the Companys inventory reserve are as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nInventory reserves - beginning of period $ 942 $ -\nIncrease in inventory reserves 31,480\nInventory reserves - end of period $ 32,422 $ 942\nNote 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and tested periodically for impairment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company performs its goodwill impairment testing annually during the fourth quarter, or sooner if indicators or if circumstances were to occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the Companys reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill.\nThe Company has concluded that there was an impairment-triggering event during the quarter ended June 30, 2022 that required the Company to perform a detailed analysis of the current carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets. For goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing purposes, the Company has one reporting unit.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Companys market capitalization fell below total net assets. In addition, financial performance continued to weaken during the quarter, which was contrary to prior experience. Management reassessed business performance expectations following persistent adverse developments in equity markets, deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, lower-than-expected sales, and an increase in operating expenses. These indicators, in the aggregate, required impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets.\nBased on the results of this testing, the Company determined that the carrying values of the aggregate value of its goodwill and intangible assets were not recoverable. The Company recorded impairment charges during the second quarter of 2022, representing a full impairment of the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets. The Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately $69.9 million, representing the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $54.7 million and $15.2 million, respectively.\nChanges in goodwill consisted of the following:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nGoodwill - beginning of period $ 50,090 $ 632\nGoodwill acquired during period 4,368 49,458\nGoodwill purchase accounting adjustment -\nGoodwill impairment loss (54,747 ) -\nGoodwill - end of period $ -\n$ 50,090\nIntangible assets, net as of December 31, 2022 were as follows:\nIntangible Assets, Gross Accumulated Amortization and Impairment Intangible Assets, Net\n(In thousands) January 1,\nAdditions December 31,\nJanuary 1,\nExpense and\nImpairments, net December 31,\nJanuary 1,\nDecember 31,\nTrade names $ 2,418 $ 317 $ 2,735 $ (227 ) $ (2,508 ) $ (2,735 ) $ 2,191 $ -\nCustomer relationships 6,176 6,889 (302 ) (6,587 ) (6,889 ) 5,874 -\nAcquired developed technology 4,911 1,432 6,343 (191 ) (6,152 ) (6,343 ) 4,720 -\nNon-compete agreements 1,202 -\n1,202 (60 ) (1,142 ) (1,202 ) 1,142 -\nCapitalized website costs -\n(100 ) (145 ) (245 ) -\nTotal $ 14,952 $ 2,462 $ 17,414 $ (880 ) $ (16,534 ) $ (17,414 ) $ 14,072 $ -\nIntangible assets, net as of December 31, 2021 was as follows:\nIntangible Assets, Gross Accumulated Amortization Intangible Assets, Net\n(In thousands) January 1,\nAdditions December 31,\nJanuary 1,\nExpense December 31,\nJanuary 1,\nDecember 31,\nTrade names $ 930 $ 1,488 $ 2,418 $ (88 ) $ (139 ) $ (227 ) $ 842 $ 2,191\nCustomer relationships 5,326 6,176 (89 ) (213 ) (302 ) 5,874\nAcquired developed technology -\n4,911 4,911 -\n(191 ) (191 ) -\n4,720\nNon-compete agreements -\n1,202 1,202 -\n(60 ) (60 ) -\n1,142\nCapitalized website costs (48 ) (52 ) (100 )\nTotal $ 1,919 $ 13,033 $ 14,952 $ (225 ) $ (655 ) $ (880 ) $ 1,694 $ 14,072\nAmortization expense recorded in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations were $1.4 million and $655 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 8 - Business Combinations\nAcquisition of Lab Society\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Lab Society, a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Merger Sub), Michael S. Maibach Jr., as the Owner Representative thereunder, and each of the shareholders of Lab Society (collectively, the Owners), pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Lab Society. Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company consummated the merger of Lab Society with and into Merger Sub, with Merger Sub surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Lab Society Acquisition).\nThe aggregate consideration for the Lab Society Acquisition consisted of $4.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for working capital, cash, and indebtedness of Lab Society at closing, 2,128 shares of Common Stock (the Buyer Shares), and the Earn-out Consideration (as defined below), to the extent earned.\nThe Company withheld 638 of the Buyer Shares issuable to the Owners (the Holdback Lab Buyer Shares) for the purpose of securing any post-closing adjustment owed to the Company and any claim for indemnification or payment of damages to which the Company may be entitled under the Merger Agreement. During the third quarter of 2022, 139 of the Holdback Lab Buyer Shares were forfeited after the finalization of the net working capital settlement. The remaining 499 Holdback Lab Buyer Shares were released following the twelve-month anniversary of the Closing Date in accordance with and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary post-closing adjustments, representations and warranties, and covenants of the parties. The Owners may become entitled to additional consideration with a value of up to $3.5 million based on the eligible net revenues achieved by the Lab Society business during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, of which 50% will be payable in cash and the remaining 50% will be payable by issuing shares of Common Stock. Additional information regarding the Companys contingent consideration arrangements may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nTransaction and related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees, related to the acquisition, totaled approximately $66 thousand and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All transaction and related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense.\nThe Company has prepared purchase price allocations for the business combination. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for the business combination:\n(In thousands)\nPurchase price consideration\nClosing proceeds $ 4,002\nTransaction expenses\nClosing buyer shares 1,904\nHoldback buyer shares\nEarn-out consideration 1,420\nWorking capital adjustment (255 )\nFair value of total consideration transferred 7,967\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 7,402\nFair value allocation of purchase price\nCash and cash equivalents $ 565\nAccounts receivable\nInventory 2,130\nPrepaid expenses and other current receivables\nRight - of-use assets, net\nProperty and equipment, net\nPrepaid and refundable taxes\nAccounts payable, accrued expenses, and other current liabilities (1,224 )\nDeferred revenue (963 )\nDeferred tax liability (237 )\nFinance lease liabilities, current (36 )\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current (35 )\nOperating lease liabilities, current (112 )\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current (192 )\nAcquired intangible assets 2,462\nGoodwill 4,368\nTotal purchase price $ 7,967\nIdentified intangible assets consist of trade names, technology, and customer relationships. The fair value of intangible assets and the determination of their respective useful lives were made in accordance with ASC 805 and are outlined in the table below:\n(In thousands) Asset\nValue Useful Life\nIdentified intangible assets\nTrade names $ 317 5 years\nAcquired developed technology 1,432 8 years\nCustomer relationships 6 years\nTotal identified intangible assets $ 2,462\nThe Companys initial fair value estimates related to the various identified intangible assets of Lab Society were determined under various valuation approaches including the Income Approach, Relief-from-Royalty Method, and Discounted Cash Flow Method. These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending, and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted-average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in the Companys stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, the Company deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of its property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022. Based on its interim testing, the Company noted that the entire carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets were impaired. Additional information regarding the Companys interim testing on goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe amount of revenue of Lab Society included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date of February 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022 was $4.5 million.\nAcquisition of Precision and Cascade\nOn September 29, 2021 (the Execution Date), the Company entered into a Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement, as amended by an amendment dated October 1, 2021 (as amended, the Purchase Agreement), with Sinclair Scientific, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (Sinclair), Mass2Media, LLC, Precision, a Michigan limited liability company; and each of the equity holders of Sinclair named therein (collectively, the Sinclair Members). On October 1, 2021, the Company consummated the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.\nSubject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, Sinclair transferred to the Company, and the Company purchased (the Interest Purchase) from Sinclair, 100% of the equity interests of Cascade, a Delaware limited liability company, such that immediately after the consummation of such Interest Purchase, Cascade became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Precision merged (the Merger) with and into a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, Precision Extraction NewCo, LLC.\nThe aggregate consideration for the Interest Purchase and the Merger consisted of the sum of $30 million in cash, plus consideration payable to holders of outstanding Sinclair equity awards, subject to certain adjustments for working capital, cash, and indebtedness, payable in connection with the Interest Purchase; the number of shares of Common Stock, subject to adjustment, equal to the quotient of $20.0 million divided by the volume weighted average price per share of Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the Execution Date (the VWAP Price), issuable in connection with the Merger; Holdback Buyer Shares; and the True-Up Buyer Shares, issuable in connection with the Merger.\nThe Company withheld 588 shares issuable to certain members (the Holdback Buyer Shares) for the purpose of securing any post-closing adjustment owed to the Company and any claim for indemnification or payment of damages to which the Company may be entitled under the Purchase Agreement. These shares were not released as of December 31,2022.\nThe Purchase Agreement included customary post-closing adjustments, representations and warranties, and covenants of the parties. The Sinclair Members became entitled to additional shares of Common Stock (the True-Up Buyer Shares) and cash (together with the True-Up Buyer Shares, the Aggregate True-Up Payment) based on the eligible net revenues (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) achieved by the Cascade and Precision businesses during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021.\nOn August 10, 2022, the Company entered into a post-closing adjustment settlement agreement (Agreement) with Sinclair. The Agreement was entered into in connection with the Purchase Agreement. According to the Purchase Agreement, $2.5 million was held by the escrow agent as the Adjustment Escrow Amount, $4.5 million was held by the escrow agent as the Indemnity Escrow Amount. On August 17, 2022, the Company made the final Aggregate True-up Payment of approximately $5.6 million, of which $3.3 million was paid in cash and 435 True-Up Buyer Shares were released to the Sinclair Members, and the Company received $1.4 million from the Adjustment Escrow Amount, and the remaining $1.1 million balance of the Adjustment Escrow Amount became part of the Indemnity Escrow Amount.\nTransaction and related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees, related to the acquisition, totaled approximately $63 thousand and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All transaction and related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense.\nThe following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for the business combination:\n(In thousands)\nPurchase price consideration\nCash paid to Sinclair Members at the close $ 23,000\nCash contributed to escrow accounts at the close 7,000\nCash paid for excess net working capital 1,430\nStock issued at the close 14,535\nFair value of contingent consideration to be achieved 3,953\nFair value of total consideration transferred 49,918\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 48,630\nFair value allocation of purchase price\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,288\nAccounts receivable\nInventory 6,761\nPrepaid expenses and other current receivables 1,736\nProperty and equipment, net\nRight-of-use assets, net\nCapitalized web costs, net\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (9,223 )\nDeferred revenue (5,419 )\nLong-term debt (1,961 )\nOperating lease liabilities, current (392 )\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current (362 )\nAcquired intangible assets 9,889\nGoodwill 45,002\nTotal purchase price $ 49,918\nIdentified intangible assets consist of trade names, technology, non-compete agreements, and customer relationships.

These valuation methods require management to project revenues, operating expenses, working capital investment, capital spending, and cash flows for the reporting unit over a multiyear period, as well as determine the weighted-average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate.\nDuring the quarter ended June 30, 2022, the Company identified an impairment-triggering event associated with both a sustained decline in the Companys stock price and associated market capitalization, as well as a second-quarter slowdown in the cannabis industry as a whole. Due to these factors, the Company deemed that there was an impairment to the carrying value of its property and equipment and accordingly performed interim testing as of June 30, 2022. Based on its interim testing, the Company noted that the entire carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets were impaired. Additional information regarding the Companys interim testing on goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAcquisition of PurePressure\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (the Pure Purchase Agreement) with PurePressure, LLC, a Colorado Limited liability company (PurePressure), and the members of PurePressure (collectively, the Members), Benjamin Britton as the Member Representative thereunder, and each of the Members. Concurrently with the execution of the Pure Purchase Agreement, the Company consummated the acquisition of all the outstanding equity interests of PurePressure, such that immediately after the consummation of such purchase, PurePressure became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Acquisition).\nThe aggregate consideration for the Acquisition consisted of $4.0 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments for working capital, cash, and indebtedness of PurePressure at closing; 1,646 shares of Common Stock (the Buyer Shares); and the Earn-out Consideration (as defined below), to the extent earned.\nThe Company withheld 444 of the Buyer Shares issuable to certain Members (the Holdback Buyer Shares) for the purpose of securing any post-closing adjustment owed to the Company and any claim for indemnification or payment of damages to which the Company may be entitled under the Pure Purchase Agreement. During the third quarter of 2022, 72 of the Holdback Buyer Shares were forfeited after the finalization of the net working capital settlement. On January 31, 2023, the remaining 372 Holdback Buyer Shares were released, including 6 Holdback Buyer Shares that were withheld to cover a tax indemnification claim in accordance with the Purchase Agreement.\nThe Pure Purchase Agreement includes customary post-closing adjustments, representations and warranties, and covenants of the parties. The Members may become entitled to additional consideration with a value of up to $3.0 million based on the eligible net revenues achieved by the PurePressure business during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, of which 40% will be payable in cash and the remaining 60% will be payable by issuing shares of Common Stock (collectively, the Earn-out Consideration). Additional information regarding the Companys contingent consideration arrangements may be found in Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nSubject to certain customary limitations, the Members will indemnify the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, and other agents against certain losses related to, among other things, breaches of the Members and PurePressures representations and warranties, indebtedness, transaction expenses, pre-closing taxes, and the failure to perform covenants or obligations under the Pure Purchase Agreement, and the Company will indemnify the Members and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, and other agents against certain losses related to, among other things, breaches of the Companys representations and warranties and the failure to perform covenants or obligations under the Pure Purchase Agreement.\nTransaction and related costs, consisting primarily of professional fees, related to the acquisition, totaled approximately $563 thousand and $0 for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. All transaction and related costs were expensed as incurred and are included in general and administrative expense.\nThe Company has prepared purchase price allocations for the business combination. The following table sets forth the components and the allocation of the purchase price for the business combination:\n(In thousands)\nPurchase price consideration\nClosing proceeds $ 3,613\nIndebtedness paid\nTransaction expenses\nClosing buyer shares 2,211\nHoldback buyer shares\nEarn-out consideration\nWorking capital adjustment\nFair value of total consideration transferred 7,950\nTotal purchase price, net of cash acquired $ 7,647\nFair value allocation of purchase price\nCash and cash equivalents $ 303\nAccounts receivable, net\nInventory 1,537\nProperty and equipment, net\nRight-of-use assets, net\nPrepaid expenses and other current receivables\nOther non-current assets\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses (765 )\nDeferred revenue (762 )\nOperating lease liabilities, current (117 )\nOperating lease liabilities, non-current (74 )\nFinance lease liabilities, current (4 )\nFinance lease liabilities, non-current (10 )\nNotes payable, current (260 )\nNotes payable, non-current (12 )\nAcquired intangible assets 3,037\nGoodwill 4,542\nTotal purchase price $ 7,950\nIdentified intangible assets consist of trade names, technology, and customer relationships.

Additional information regarding the Companys interim testing on goodwill and intangible assets may be found in Note 7 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 9 - Debt\nThe Companys debt consisted of:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nNote payable - Exchange Note $ 31,975 $ -\nPPP Loan\nNavitas Loan -\nOther notes payable -\nTotal debt 32,654 1,101\nLess: unamortized debt discount (3,414 ) -\nTotal debt, net of debt discount 29,240 1,101\nLess: current portion, net of current unamortized debt discount (28,833 ) (1,089 )\nLong-term debt $ 407 $ 12\nNote Payable\nSecurities Purchase Agreement\nOn March 14, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Purchase Agreement) with the Investor, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Investor, in a private placement transaction, in exchange for the payment by the Investor of $65.0 million, less applicable expenses, as set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement, a senior secured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of $65.0 million (the SPA Note), and a SPA Warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock.\nAugust 2022 Securities Exchange Agreement\nOn August 18, 2022, the Company reached an agreement with the Investor to amend its existing senior SPA Note and entered into the August 2022 Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the August 2022 Exchange Agreement, the Company partially paid $35.2 million along with approximately $300 thousand in repayments for other fees under the SPA Note and exchanged the remaining balance of the SPA Note for an Exchange Note with an aggregate original principal amount of $35.0 million and a new Note Exchange Warrant to purchase 71,139 shares of Common Stock and modified an existing SPA Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 34,406 shares of Common Stock. The Company exchanged the SPA Warrant for new August 2022 Warrants.\nThe Exchange Note is a senior secured obligation of the Company and ranks senior to all indebtedness of the Company. The Exchange Note will mature on the three-year anniversary of its issuance (the Maturity Date) and contains a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash, beginning September 1, 2022. The principal amount of the Exchange Note will be payable on the Maturity Date, provided that the Investor will be entitled to a cash sweep of 20% of the proceeds received by the Company in connection with any equity financing, which will reduce the outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note.\nAt any time, the Company may prepay all of the Exchange Note by redemption at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Note plus accrued but unpaid interest. The Investor will also have the option of requiring the Company to redeem the Exchange Note on the one-year or two-year anniversaries of issuance at a price equal to the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest, or if the Company undergoes a fundamental change at a price equal to 102.5% of the then-outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note plus accrued but unpaid interest.\nThe Exchange Note imposes certain customary affirmative and negative covenants upon the Company, as well as covenants that restrict the Company and its subsidiaries from incurring any additional indebtedness or suffering any liens, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries from making certain investments, subject to specified exceptions, restrict the declaration of any dividends or other distributions, subject to specified exceptions, require the Company not to exceed maximum levels of allowable cash spend while the Exchange Note is outstanding, and require the Company to maintain minimum amounts of cash on hand. If an event of default under the Exchange Note occurs, the Investor can elect to redeem the Exchange Note for cash equal to 115% of the then-outstanding principal amount of the Note (or such lesser principal amount accelerated by the Investor), plus accrued and unpaid interest, including default interest, which accrues at a rate per year equal to 15% from the date of a default or event of default.\nUntil the date the Exchange Note is fully repaid, the Investor has, subject to certain exceptions, the right to participate for up to 30% of any offering of debt, equity (other than an offering of solely Common Stock), or equity-linked securities, including without limitation any debt, preferred stock, or other instrument or security, of the Company or its subsidiaries.\nThe Modified Warrant has an exercise price of $430.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions, will be exercisable on and after the six-month anniversary of issuance, have a term of five and one-half years from the date of issuance, and will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Modified Warrant (the Modified Warrant Shares) or if shareholder approval for the full exercise of the Modified Warrant is not received, in which case the Modified Warrant will also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis at the Investors election.\nThe Note Exchange Warrant has an exercise price of $246.00 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions, were exercisable upon issuance, and have a term of five and one-half years from the date of issuance and will be exercisable on a cash basis, unless there is not an effective registration statement covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant (the Note Exchange Warrant Shares and, together with the Modified Warrant Shares, the Exchange Warrant Shares) or if shareholder approval for the full exercise of the Note Exchange Warrant is not received, in which case the Note Exchange Warrant will also be exercisable on a cashless exercise basis at the Investors election. Until the Company completed a qualified equity financing of at least $15.0 million, which requirement was satisfied with sales under the ATM Program, the Note Exchange Warrants exercise price would have been reduced to the extent the Company issued securities, subject to certain exceptions, for a lower purchase price. The Note Exchange Warrant also prohibited the Company, until following the completion of such qualified equity financing, from issuing warrants with more favorable or preferential terms and/or provisions.\nThe August 2022 Warrants will each provide that in no event will the number of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of such warrant result in the Investors beneficial ownership exceeding 4.99% of the Companys shares of Common Stock outstanding at the time of exercise (which percentage may be decreased or increased by the Investor, but to no greater than 9.99%, and provided that any increase above 4.99% will not be effective until the sixty-first day after notice of such request by the Investor to increase its beneficial ownership limit has been delivered to the Company).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company issued 2,000 shares of its Common Stock pursuant to the cashless exercise of August 2022 Warrants. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had outstanding liability-classified August 2022 Warrants that allow the Investor to purchase 100,544 shares of the Companys Common Stock. Additional information regarding the Companys August 2022 Warrants may be found in Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table summarizes the short-term and long-term portions of the Exchange Note as of December 31, 2022:\n(In thousands) Short-Term Long-Term Notes\nPayable,\nNet\nPrincipal $ 31,975 $ -\n$ 31,975\nUnamortized discount (3,414 ) -\n(3,414 )\nNet carrying amount $ 28,561 $ -\n$ 28,561\nPaycheck Protection Program Loan\nPaycheck Protection Program Loans under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act\nIn May 2020, the Company entered into a PPP Loan with Bank of America pursuant to the PPP under the CARES Act administered by the SBA.\nThe Company received total proceeds of approximately $779 thousand from the unsecured PPP Loan, which was originally scheduled to mature on May 7, 2022. The Company applied for forgiveness on the $779 thousand of PPP loan, but forgiveness was denied by the SBA. On June 23, 2022, the Company received a letter from Bank of America agreeing to extend the maturity date to May 7, 2025 and the loan bears interest at a rate of 1.00% per year. The PPP loan is payable in 34 equal combined monthly principal and interest payments of approximately $24 thousand that commenced on August 7, 2022.\nThe breakdown of PPP Loan balances by current and non-current as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(In thousands) Balance Sheet\nLocation December 31,\nDecember 31,\nPPP Loan, current Long-term debt,\ncurrent $ 255 $ 792\nPPP Loan, non-current Long-term debt\nTotal PPP Loan outstanding\n$ 656 $ 804\nPurePressure SBA Debt\nAs part of the acquisition of PurePressure, $159 thousand of debt remained outstanding from a standard SBA loan as of December 31, 2021. This debt was paid off during the year ended December 31, 2022 as a part of the PurePressure acquisition.\nAs of December 31, 2022, future minimum principal payments for all debt were as follows:\nYears Ending December 31 (In thousands),\n$ 32,247\nTotal future payments $ 32,654\nNote 10 - Leases\nThe determination if any arrangement contained a lease at its inception was done based on whether or not the Company has the right to control the asset during the contract period. The lease term was determined assuming the exercise of options that were reasonably certain to occur. Leases with a lease term of 12 months or less at inception were not reflected in the Companys balance sheet and those lease costs are expensed on a straight-line basis over the respective term. Leases with a term greater than 12 months were reflected as non-current right-of-use assets and current and non-current lease liabilities in the Companys consolidated balance sheets.\nAs the implicit interest rate in its leases was generally not known, the Companys used its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate for purposes of determining the present value of its lease liabilities. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Companys weighted-average discount rate utilized for its leases was 7.29% and 7.16%, respectively.\nWhen a contract contained lease and non-lease elements, both were accounted for as a single lease component.\nThe Company had several non-cancelable finance leases for machinery and equipment. The Companys finance leases have remaining lease terms of one year to five years.\nThe Company had several non-cancelable operating leases for corporate offices, warehouses, showrooms, research and development facilities, and vehicles. The Companys leases have remaining lease terms of one year to five years, some of which include options to extend. Some leases include payment for communal area maintenance associated with the property.\nAdditional information on the Companys operating and financing lease activity was as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands)\nOperating lease cost $ 1,119 $ 396\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\nInterest on lease liabilities\nTotal lease cost $ 1,345 $ 617\n(In thousands) Balance Sheet\nLocation December 31,\nDecember 31,\nAssets\nRight-of-use assets, net Operating lease right-of-use assets, net $ 2,210 $ 1,479\nFinance lease assets Property and equipment, net\nTotal lease assets\n$ 2,471 $ 1,859\nLiabilities\nCurrent:\nOperating Operating lease liabilities, current $ 734 $ 814\nFinancing Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\nNon-current:\nOperating Operating lease liabilities, non-current 1,587\nFinancing Other non-current liabilities\nTotal lease liabilities\n$ 2,619 $ 1,967\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases\n3.59 years 3.11 years\nWeighted-average remaining lease term - finance leases\n2.30 years 2.36 years\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n6.76 % 8.03 %\nWeighted-average discount rate - finance leases\n7.83 % 6.29 %\nMaturities of operating and finance lease liabilities as of December 31, 2022 were as follows:\nYears Ending December 31 (In thousands), Operating\nLeases Finance\nLeases\n$ 863 $ 171\n-\nTotal minimum lease payments 2,631\nLess imputed interest (310 ) (30 )\nTotal lease liabilities $ 2,321 $ 298\nNote 11 - Convertible Promissory Notes\nOn January 11, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors and shareholders approved the amendment to the conversion formula of the Convertible Promissory Notes (the Convertible Notes) issued by the Company on dates between August 2020 and November 2020. Pursuant to the amendment, immediately prior to the consummation of a public transaction, the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes, together with all accrued and unpaid interest, shall convert into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, at a conversion price of $1,544.00 per share.\nWhile the original conversion feature was bifurcated from the host instrument, the Company determined that the amended conversion feature would not require bifurcation. Since the accounting for the conversion feature changed because of the amendment, the Company applied extinguishment accounting pursuant to its accounting policy.\nAccordingly, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of $2.7 million in connection with the derecognition of the net carrying amount of the extinguished debt of $19.7 million (inclusive of $13.1 million of principal and $7.1 million of derivative liabilities, less $587 thousand of debt discount) and the recognition of the $17.0 million fair value of the new convertible notes (including the same principal amount of $13.1 million plus the $3.9 million fair value of the beneficial conversion feature).\nOn February 1, 2021, in conjunction with the closing of the Companys IPO, the Convertible Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $13.1 million were converted into 8,485 shares of Common Stock at the election of the Company at a conversion price of $1,544.00 per share.\nNote 12 - Stockholders Equity\nOn July 11, 2022, the Company increased its authorized number of shares to 8,000,000, consisting of: 5,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.001 per share and 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. On January 9, 2020, the Company designated 105,000 shares of the 3,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock, as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (Series A Preferred Stock).\nAmendment of Conversion Formulas\nOn January 11, 2021, the Companys Board of Directors approved the amendment to the conversion formula of the Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes. After the amendment:\n\u25cf the Series A Preferred Stock is convertible, at any time after the issuance or immediately prior to the closing of a public transaction, into Common Stock in an amount of shares equal to (i) the product of the Series A Preferred Stock original price plus accrued but unpaid dividends on the shares being converted, multiplied by the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock being converted, divided by (ii) a conversion price of $1,544.00 per share (after the reverse split taking effect); and\n\u25cf immediately prior to the consummation of a public transaction, the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest shall convert into a number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the outstanding principal amount of the Convertible Notes together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder immediately prior to such public transaction divided by (ii) a conversion price of $1,544.00 per share (after the reverse split taking effect).\nInitial Public Offering\nOn February 1, 2021, the Company completed an IPO for the sale of 27,000 shares of Common Stock at a price of $2,000.00 per share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,050 additional shares of Common Stock on the same terms and conditions for the purpose of covering any over-allotments in connection with the IPO, and warrants to purchase 810 shares of Common Stock (equal to 3% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued in the IPO) at an exercise price of $2,500.00 per share (which is equal to 125% of the IPO price). Subsequently, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option, and on February 4, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 4,050 shares of Common Stock for a price of $2,000.00 per share and granted to the underwriters warrants to purchase 121 additional shares of Common Stock (equal to 3% of the amount of shares issued as part of the exercised of the over-allotment option) at an exercise price of $2,500.00 per share. The exercise of the over-allotment option brought the total number of shares of Common Stock sold by the Company in connection with the IPO to 31,050 shares and the total net proceeds received in connection with the IPO to approximately $57 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.\nImmediately prior to the closing of the Companys IPO, all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Convertible Notes were converted into 6,865 shares of Common Stock and 8,485 shares of Common Stock, respectively, at a conversion price of $1,544.00 per share.\nSubsequent Public Offering\nOn February 19, 2021, the Company consummated the February Offering for the sale of 27,778 shares of Common Stock for a price of $2,700.00 per share. The Company also granted the underwriters a 45-day option to purchase up to 4,167 additional shares of Common Stock on the same terms and conditions for the purpose of covering any over-allotments in connection with the February Offering, and warrants to purchase 833 shares of Common Stock (equal to 3% of the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock issued in the February Offering) at an exercise price of $3,375.00 per share (which is equal to 125% of the February Offering). Subsequently, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option, and on March 22, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of an additional 4,167 shares of Common Stock for a price of $2,700.00 per share and granted to the underwriters warrants to purchase 125 additional shares of Common Stock (equal to 3% of the amount of shares issued as part of the exercised of the over-allotment option) at an exercise price of $3,375.00 per share. The exercise of the over-allotment option brought the total number of shares of Common Stock sold by the Company in connection with the February Offering to 31,944 shares and the total net proceeds received in connection with the February Offering to approximately $80 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses.\nUnderwriter Termination\nOn September 14, 2021, the Company entered into a letter agreement and waiver (the Letter Agreement), to amend the terms of its underwriting agreement with the representative of the underwriters in the IPO. Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the representative agreed to waive the right of first refusal included in the underwriting agreement in consideration of a cash payment to the representative of $2.4 million and the right to participate as a co-manager with 10% of the economics with respect to the Companys next public offering of securities, payable in cash upon the closing of such offering.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 25, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Securities Agreement) with an institutional investor and other accredited investors for the sale by the Company of 12,253 shares (the SA Shares) of Common Stock, pre-funded warrants (the Pre-Funded Warrants) to purchase up to an aggregate of 7,853 shares of Common Stock, and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 15,079 shares of Common Stock (the Common Warrants and, collectively with the Pre-Funded Warrants, the SA Warrants), in a private placement offering. The combined purchase price for one share of Common Stock (or one Pre-Funded Warrant) and the accompanying fraction of a Common Warrant was $1,360.00 per share.\nSubject to certain ownership limitations, the SA Warrants are exercisable six months from issuance. Each Pre-Funded Warrant was exercisable into one share of Common Stock (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof). Each Common Warrant is exercisable into one share of Common Stock at a price per share of $1,496.00 (as adjusted from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof) and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the initial exercise date. The institutional investor that received the Pre-Funded Warrants fully exercised such warrants in March 2022.\nRaymond Chang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Company, and Stuart Wilcox, who formerly served as our Chief Operating Officer, and at the time he was a member of the Companys Board of Directors, participated in the private placement on essentially the same terms as other investors, except for having a combined purchase price of $1,380.00 per share.\nThe gross proceeds to the Company from the private placement were approximately $27.3 million, before deducting the placement agents fees and other offering expenses, and excluding the proceeds, if any, from the exercise of the SA Warrants.\nIssuance of Common Stock in Connection with Acquisitions\nOn October 1, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 3,332 shares of its Common Stock to the Precision and Cascade shareholders in connection with the Companys acquisition of Precision and Cascade. On August 17, 2022, the Company issued an additional 435 shares of its Common Stock to the Precision and Cascade shareholders for contingent liabilities. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 31, 2021, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,202 shares of its Common Stock to the PurePressure shareholders in connection with the Companys acquisition of PurePressure. On January 31, 2023, the remaining 372 Holdback Buyer Shares were released, including 6 Holdback Buyer Shares that were withheld to cover a tax indemnification claim in accordance with the Purchase Agreement. Additional information regarding the PurePressure Holdback Buyer Shares may be found in Note 8 - Business Combinations, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn February 1, 2022, the Company issued an aggregate of 1,491 shares of its Common Stock to the Lab Society shareholders in connection with the Companys acquisition of Lab Society. On April 28, 2023, the Company issued the remaining 499 Holdback Buyer Shares to the Lab Society Owners in accordance with the Lab Society Merger Agreement. Refer to Note 8 - Business Combinations, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAt The Marketing Offering\nOn October 18, 2022, the Company entered into the ATM Program with the Agent pursuant to which it may issue and sell, from time to time, shares of its Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $50 million, depending on market demand, with the Agent acting as an agent for sales. The ATM Program allowed the Company to sell shares of Common Stock pursuant to specific parameters defined by the Company as well as those defined by the SEC and the ATM Program agreement. As of December 31, 2022, the Company sold 306,628 shares of Common Stock, under the ATM at an average price of $50.85 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $15.6 million, and net proceeds of $15.0 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $468 thousand and legal fees totaling $75 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the Investor under the Exchange Note. The Company used net proceeds generated from the ATM Program for working capital and general corporate purposes, including repayment of indebtedness, funding its transformation initiatives and product category expansion efforts and capital expenditures. Due to the late filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company is no longer eligible to utilize the registration statement on Form S-3 relating to the ATM Program, and does not anticipate any further sales under the ATM Program in the foreseeable future.\nConfidentially Marketed Public Offering\nOn December 16, 2022, the Company issued 594,232 shares of its Common Stock, Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants to purchase 75,000 shares of its Common Stock, and accompanying December 2022 Warrants to purchase 1,338,462 shares of the Companys Common Stock. The Company received net proceeds from the Offering of approximately $8.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and estimated expenses. The Company used the net proceeds from the Offering, together with its existing cash resources, for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may include capital expenditures and repayment of debt.\nThe Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants were exercisable immediately upon issuance at an exercise price of $0.001 per share and do not have an expiration date. The December 2022 Warrants were exercisable immediately and have a term of exercise equal to five years from the initial exercise date at an exercise price of $13.00 per share. The offering price for the securities was $13.00 per share (or $12.98 for each Pre-Funded 2022 Warrant).\nThe December 2022 Warrants may not be exercised by the holder to the extent that the holder, together with its affiliates, would beneficially own, after such exercise more than 4.99% of the shares of the Companys Common Stock then outstanding (subject to the right of the holder to increase or decrease such beneficial ownership limitation upon notice to the Company, provided that such limitation cannot exceed 9.99%) and provided that any increase in the beneficial ownership limitation shall not be effective until the sixty-first day after such notice is delivered.\nThe Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants were classified as a component of permanent equity and the December 2022 Warrants were liability-classified and were recorded at the issuance date using a relative fair value allocation method. The Pre-Funded 2022 Warrants are equity-classified because they are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the equity instruments, are immediately exercisable, and permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of Common Stock upon exercise. In addition, such warrants do not provide any guarantee of value or return. The December 2022 Warrants are liability-classified as there is a volatility floor and these warrants are not indexed to the Companys own stock.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company valued the December 2022 Warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and determined the fair value at $5.9 million. The key inputs to the valuation model included the annualized volatility of 98.0% and the expected term of about 5 years.\nRaymond Chang, Chairman and CEO, participated in the Offering and purchased 115,385 shares of Common Stock and 230,769 December 2022 Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.5 million.\nAdditional information regarding the Companys December 2022 Warrants may be found in Note 1 - Overview, Basis of Presentation, and Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4 - Fair Value Measures, included elsewhere in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 13 - Stock-Based Compensation and Employee Benefit Plans\n2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan\nOn April 29, 2022, the Companys Board of Directors, and on June 8, 2022, the Companys stockholders, adopted and approved the 2022 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the 2022 Plan), which replaced the 2020 Stock Option Plan (the 2020 Plan). The 2022 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, stock appreciation right awards, performance share awards, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other stock-based awards, and cash-based awards. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that may be reserved and available for grant and issuance under the 2022 Plan is 26,483 shares, which includes the 10,000 shares authorized under the 2022 Plan, plus the rollover of 16,483 issued and outstanding awards under the 2020 Plan. Shares will be deemed to have been issued under the 2022 Plan solely to the extent actually issued and delivered pursuant to an award. If any award granted under the 2020 Plan or the 2022 Plan expires, is canceled, terminates unexercised, or is forfeited, the number of shares subject thereto is again available for grant under the 2022 Plan. The 2022 Plan shall continue in effect, unless sooner terminated, until the tenth anniversary of the date on which it is adopted by the Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2022, there were 4,104 shares of Common Stock available to be granted under the Companys 2022 Plan.\nThe Companys stock option compensation expense was $4.3 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the Companys 2022 Plan are generally non-qualified and are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free market interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life, and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock. No stock options were granted during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe following table summarizes the Companys assumptions used in the valuation of options granted during the year ended December 31, 2021:\nVolatility\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n1.10% - 1.63 %\nDividend yield\n0.00 %\nExpected life (Years)\nForfeiture rate\n0.00 %\nThe Black-Scholes option-pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities with a term similar to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Companys history of having never issued a dividend and managements current expectation of future action surrounding dividends. The Company calculates the expected volatility of the stock price based on the corresponding volatility of the Companys peer group stock price for a period consistent with the underlying instruments expected term. The expected lives for such grants were based on the simplified method for employees and directors.\nIn arriving at stock-based compensation expense, the Company estimates the number of stock-based awards that will be forfeited due to employee turnover. The Companys forfeiture assumption is based primarily on its employee turnover historical experience. If the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements. If the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate, then an adjustment will be made to lower the estimated forfeiture rate, which will result in an increase to expense recognized in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The expense the Company recognizes in future periods will be affected by changes in the estimated forfeiture rate and may differ significantly from amounts recognized in the current period.\nThe following table presents option activity under the Companys stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\n(In thousands, except share and per share data) Number of\nOptions Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice Aggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOptions outstanding at December 31, 2020 15,666 $ 702.00 $ -\nGranted 7,600 2,426.00\nExercised (3,288 ) 646.00\nForfeited (2,151 ) 769.00\nCanceled (5 ) 886.00\nOptions outstanding at December 31, 2021 17,822 1,436.00 $ 62.64\nGranted -\n-\nExercised (43 ) 458.42\nForfeited (2,363 ) 1,018.82\nCanceled (1,977 ) 1,394.70\nOptions outstanding at December 31, 2022 13,439 $ 1,518.05 $ -\nOptions vested and exercisable as of December 31, 2022 11,015 $ 1,327.13\nTotal recognized compensation expense related to the Companys stock option plans for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $3.5 million and $5.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested options under the Companys option plans was $2.9 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 7.84 years.\nThe following table summarizes information about options vested and exercisable at December 31, 2022:\nOptions Vested and Exercisable\nPrice ($) Number of\nOptions Weighted-Average\nRemaining Contractual\nLife (Years) Weighted-Average\nExercise Price\n$ 456.00 3,668 7.39 $ 456.00\n$ 972.00 4,039 7.82 $ 972.00\n$ 1,536.00-1,840.00 8.66 $ 1,708.79\n$ 2,768.00-3,722.00 3,173 8.14 $ 2,770.05\nRestricted Stock Units\nUnder the 2022 Plan, the Company may grant restricted stock units to employees, directors, and officers. The restricted stock units granted generally vest equally over periods ranging from one to three years. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the closing market price of the Companys Common Stock on the date of grant. Compensation expense related to the restricted stock units is recognized using a straight-line attribution method over the vesting period.\nThe following table presents restricted stock unit activity under the 2022 Plan for the year ended December 31, 2022:\nNumber of\nShares Weighted-\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nBalance at December 31, 2021 -\n$ -\nGranted 9,440 252.40\nVested (1,249 ) 365.66\nForfeitures (500 ) 302.41\nCancelled -\n-\nBalance at December 31, 2022 7,691 $ 230.75\nTotal recognized compensation expense related to the Companys restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $818,000 and $0, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock units was $1.4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.59 years.\n2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn April 29, 2022, the Companys Board of Directors, and on June 8, 2022, the Companys stockholders, adopted and approved the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP). The Company has initially reserved 2,500 shares of Common Stock for issuance under the ESPP. On December 31, 2022, 2,500 shares were available for future issuance.\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees are granted options to purchase shares of Common Stock at the lower of 85% of the fair market value of the stock at the time of grant or 85% of the fair market value at the time of exercise. Options to purchase shares are granted twice yearly on or about August 1 and February 1 and are exercisable on or about the succeeding January 31 and July 31, respectively, of each year. No participant may purchase more than $25 thousand worth of Common Stock annually. No Common Stock was granted under the 2022 ESPP during the year ended December 31, 2022.\nEmployee Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains an employees savings and retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the 401(k) Plan). All full-time U.S. employees become eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. The Companys contribution to the 401(k) Plan is discretionary. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not contribute to the 401(k) Plan.\nNote 14 - Stock Warrants\nThe following table presents all warrant activity of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nNumber of\nWarrants Weighted-\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWarrants outstanding at December 31, 2020 4,141 $ 4.00\nGranted 1,891 4.00\nExercised (4,672 ) 4.00\nWarrants outstanding at December 31, 2021 1,360 4.00\nGranted 1,541,937 38.57\nExercised (10,296 ) 47.97\nCanceled (3,000 ) 246.00\nWarrants outstanding at December 31, 2022 1,530,001 $ 38.07\nThe Company received proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $2 thousand and $8 thousand for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nNote 15 - Income Taxes\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted and signed into law. GAAP requires recognition of the tax effects of new legislation during the reporting period that includes the enactment date. The CARES Act includes changes to the tax provisions that benefits business entities and makes certain technical corrections to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The tax relief measures for businesses include a five-year net operating loss carryback, suspension of the annual deduction limitation of 80% of taxable income from net operating losses generated in a tax year beginning after December 31, 2017, changes to the deductibility of interest, acceleration of alternative minimum tax credit refunds, payroll tax relief, and a technical correction to allow accelerated deductions for qualified improvement property. The CARES Act also provides other non-tax benefits to assist those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company evaluated the impact of the CARES Act and determined that its adoption did not have a material impact to the income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2022 or December 31, 2021, respectively.\nFor the period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a tax provision of approximately $23 thousand, comprised of its change in deferred tax liability during the year related to its indefinite-lived intangible asset balance. The indefinite-lived intangibles are not all available as a source of income and thus are not fully available to offset the Companys deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $96.7 million and $71.6 million, respectively. The net operating loss carryforwards for United States income taxes may be available to reduce future years taxable income. Management believes that the realization of the benefits from these losses appears not more than likely due to the Companys limited operating history and continuing losses for United States income tax purposes. Accordingly, the Company has provided a 100% valuation allowance on its net operating loss carryforward deferred tax assets to reduce the assets to zero. Management will review this valuation allowance periodically and adjust as necessary.\nThe following table summarizes the significant differences between the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate and the Companys effective tax rate for financial statement purposes for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\nUS Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 %\nState taxes 3.2 % 3.8 %\nPermanent differences and other 0.2 % 0.1 %\nDebt extinguishment (4.3 )% 1.7 %\nDerivative liabilities 5.7 % 0.0 %\nStock-based compensation (0.1 )% (2.4 )%\nIntangible Asset Impairment (5.4 )% 0.0 %\nDebt discount 0.0 % 0.0 %\nPrior period adjustments to opening deferred tax 0.4 % 2.2 %\nChange in valuation allowance (20.6 )% (26.4 )%\n0.0 % 0.0 %\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n(In thousands) December 31,\nDecember 31,\nNet operating loss carryforward $ 24,295 $ 12,565\nAccruals, reserves, and other 20,082 2,529\nStock-based compensation 1,578\nFixed assets -\nIntangible Assets 3,534 -\nCapitalized Sec. 174 R&E 1,937 -\nResearch and development tax credit carryforward 1,260\nLease liability\nTotal deferred tax assets 53,331 16,489\nValuation allowance (52,730 ) (13,852 )\nNet deferred tax assets $ 601 $ 2,637\nFixed assets -\n(144 )\nIntangible assets -\n(1,888 )\nDebt discount -\n-\nRight-of-use assets (549 ) (323 )\nDeferred commissions (52 ) (307 )\nTotal deferred tax liabilities $ (601 ) $ (2,662 )\n$ -\n$ (25 )\nThe Company recognizes federal and state deferred tax assets or liabilities based on the Companys estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryovers. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. The Company considers projected future taxable income and planning strategies in making this assessment. As of December 31, 2021, because of a three-year cumulative loss and recent events, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance was necessary to offset its deferred tax assets. The Company also has indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill which generate a deferred tax liability that is not available to fully offset its deferred tax assets due to uncertainty as to when the deferred tax liability will reverse as a source of taxable income. As a result, the Company is in a net deferred tax liability position as of December 31, 2022. The Company intends to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal. The Company will continue to evaluate its deferred tax balances to determine any assets that are more likely than not to be realized. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had federal and state income tax net operating loss carryovers $96.7 million and $71.6 million, respectively. Of the federal balance, approximately $675 thousand will expire if not utilized by 2037 and $96.0 million carry forward indefinitely but are only available to offset 80% of taxable income per year. As of December 31, 2022, the Company also had federal research credits of approximately $1.1 million that will expire if not utilized by 2041. The utilization of the Companys net operating loss carryforwards and research tax credit carryovers could be subject to annual limitations under Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and similar state tax provisions due to ownership change limitations that may have occurred previously or that could occur in the future. These ownership changes limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets that can be utilized to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership change, as defined by Section 382 and 383, results from transactions increasing ownership of certain stockholders or public groups in the stock of the corporation by more than 50 percent points over a three-year period. The Company has not conducted an analysis of an ownership change under section 382. To the extent that a study is completed, and an ownership change is deemed to occur, the Companys net operating losses and tax credits could be limited.\nThe Company does not have any uncertain tax positions or events leading to uncertainty in a tax position. The Companys 2017 through 2021 corporate income tax returns are subject to Internal Revenue Service examination. In addition, to the extent that tax attributes are utilized in future years to offset taxable income or income taxes, the IRS and state taxing authorities can examine the years in which those attributes were generated and adjust the attributes.\nNote 16 - Net Loss Per Share\nNet loss per share calculations for all periods have been adjusted to reflect the Companys reverse stock splits. Net loss per share was calculated based on the weighted-average number of the Companys Common Stock outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is calculated using the weighted-average number of Common Stock outstanding during the periods. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of Common Stock, including outstanding stock options, stock related to unvested restricted stock units, and outstanding warrants to the extent dilutive. Net loss per share, assuming dilution, is equal to basic net loss per share because the effect of dilutive securities outstanding during the periods, including options and warrants computed using the treasury stock method, is anti-dilutive.\nThe components of basic and diluted net loss per share were as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nNumerator:\nNet loss attributable to Agrify Corporation $ (188,173 ) $ (32,465 )\nAccrued dividend attributable to Preferred A Stockholders -\n(61 )\nNet loss available for Common Stockholders $ (188,173 ) $ (32,526 )\nDenominator:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding - basic and diluted (1) 208,573 95,455\nNet loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders - basic and diluted (1) $ (902.19 ) $ (340.75 )\nThe Companys potential dilutive securities, which include stock options, restricted stock units, and warrants, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of Common Shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders is the same. The Company excluded the following potential Common Stock equivalents presented based on amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share attributable to Common Stockholders for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nShares subject to outstanding stock options 13,439 17,821\nShares subject to unvested restricted stock units 7,691 -\nShares subject to outstanding warrants 1,530,001 1,360\n1,551,131 19,181\nNote 17 - Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Matters\nBud & Marys Litigation\nOn September 15, 2022, the Company provided a notice of default to Bud & Marys and certain related parties notifying such parties that Bud & Marys was in default of its obligations under the Bud & Mary TTK Agreement. On October 5, 2022, Bud & Marys filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Suffolk County, naming the Company as the defendant. Bud & Marys is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with alleged unfair or deceptive trade practices, breach of contract and conversion arising from the Agreement. While the Company believes the claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself against Bud & Marys allegations, litigation is inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this matter.\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company deemed it necessary to fully reserve for the outstanding $14.7 million note receivable balance due to the current litigation and the uncertainty of the customers ability to repay the balance. The $14.7 million represents the amount of the contingent loss that the Company has determined to be reasonably possible and estimable. The actual cost of resolving this matter may be higher or lower than the amount the Company has reserved.\nIf the Company is unable to realize revenue from its TTK Solution offerings on a timely basis or at all, or if it incurs an additional loss as a result of the Bud & Marys claim, the Companys business and financial performance will be adversely affected. On November 14, 2022, the Company filed its answers and affirmative defenses to the Bud & Marys complaint and counterclaims. The Company is seeking, among other relief, monetary damages in connection with the breach of contract, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and enforcement of the guarantees. Bud & Marys is permitted to file an amended complaint, and Agrify will be permitted to make responsive filings, which may include an answer and counterclaim.\nBowdoin Construction Corp. Litigation\nOn February 22, 2023, Bowdoin Construction Corp. (Bowdoin) filed a complaint (the Bowdoin Complaint) in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Norfolk County naming the Company, Bud & Marys and certain related parties as defendants, captioned Bowdoin Construction Corp. v. Agrify Corporation, Bud & Marys Cultivation, Inc. and BMLC2, LLC, case no. 2382CV00173. The Bowdoin Complaint relates to a construction contract between Bowdoin and the Company relating to the property that is the subject of the Bud & Marys Complaint, and alleges breach of contract by Bud & Marys and by the Company due to nonpayment of approximately $7.0 million due under the contract and related indemnification claims and mechanics liens. Certain of Bowdoins subcontractors have filed ancillary civil actions, some seeking direct recovery of sums (which sums are understood to be subsumed in / covered by Bowdoins claims) against the Company. The Company is entitled to indemnification by Bud & Marys and intends to vigorously defend this and ancillary claim(s).\nMack Molding Co.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Mack Molding Co. (Mack) pursuant to which Mack will become a key supplier of VFUs. In February 2021, the Company placed a purchase order with Mack amounting to approximately $5.2 million towards the initial production of VFUs during 2021. Since February 2021, the Company increased the purchase order with Mack to approximately $26.5 million towards production of VFUs during 2021 and 2022. The Company believed the supply agreement with Mack would provide the Company with increased scaling capabilities and the ability to meet the potential future demand of its customers more efficiently. The supply agreement contemplates that, following an introductory period, the Company will negotiate a minimum percentage of the VFU requirements that the Company will purchase from Mack each year based on the agreed-upon pricing formula. The introductory period is not time-based but rather refers to the production of an initial number of units after which the parties have rights to adjust pricing and negotiate a certain minimum requirements percentage. The Company believed this approach would result in both parties making a more informed decision with respect to the pricing and other terms of the supply agreement with Mack.\nOn October 11, 2022, the Company received a $9.4 million invoice from Mack for inventory purchased on the Companys behalf to build VFUs. As part of the terms of the contract manufacturing agreement, Mack had the contractual right to bill the Company for any inventory that had aged greater than nine months. Due to the slowdown in the demand for the VFUs and the lack of a demand forecast that the Company could provide to the vendor, Mack exercised the right to invoice the Company for the slow-moving inventory. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owed Mack $8.4 million for purchased inventory on behalf of the Company to produce VFUs, which is included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn March 2, 2023, Mack filed an arbitration action seeking the amounts owed to Mack for purchased inventory. On October 27, 2023, and effective as of October 18, 2023, Mack and the Company entered into a Modification and Settlement Agreement with respect to the dispute. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events.\nTRC Electronics Litigation\nThe Company was named as a defendant in a complaint filed by TRC Electronics, Inc. (TRC) on April 13, 2023 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the Complaint, TRC asserts two causes of action against the Company: (1) breach of contract, and (2) promissory estoppel. TRCs claims are based on allegations that the Company failed to make payments due under three purchase orders for commercial electronics parts. TRC seeks damages in the amount of $565,210, plus attorneys fees, costs, and post-judgment interest. The Company has filed an answer denying liability on TRCs claims and is proceeding with discovery.\nSinclair Scientific Litigation\nOn June 15, 2023, the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Precision Extraction Newco, LLC (Precision), filed an Amended Verified Complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Sinclair Scientific, LLC (Sinclair) and certain individual defendants (the Delaware Action). The claims filed in the Delaware Action concern various breaches of the Plan of Merger and Equity Purchase Agreement dated September 29, 2021, by and between the Company, Sinclair, Mass2Media, LLC, and certain of their members (the Merger Agreement). In response to the Delaware Action, certain of the defendants filed counterclaims for breach of contract and declaratory judgment against the Company and Precision alleging breach of the Merger Agreement. The Company and Precision filed an answer to the counterclaims denying all liability on the claims and discovery in the Delaware Action has recently commenced.\nCommitments\nSupply Agreement with Mack Molding Co.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into a five-year supply agreement with Mack Molding Co. (Mack) pursuant to which Mack would become a key supplier of VFUs. In February 2021, the Company placed a purchase order with Mack amounting to approximately $5.2 million towards the initial production of VFUs during 2021.

On October 27, 2023, and effective as of October 18, 2023, Mack and the Company entered into a Modification and Settlement Agreement with respect to the dispute. See Note 19 - Subsequent Events.\nDistribution Agreements with Related Party - Bluezone Products, Inc.\nOn September 7, 2019, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with Bluezone Products, Inc. (Bluezone) for distribution rights to the Bluezone products with certain exclusivity rights. The agreement requires minimum purchases amounting to $480 thousand and $600 thousand for the first and second contract anniversary years. The agreement auto-renews for successive one-year periods unless earlier terminated. In March 2021, the Company notified Bluezone of the non-renewal of the agreement which means it ended on May 31, 2021. The Company exceeded the minimum purchase amount for the first year and purchased approximately $309 thousand of the committed $660 thousand second-year purchases through December 31, 2021. Bluezone is a related party to the Company.\nCommitted Purchase Agreement with Related Party - 4D Bios, Inc.\nOn September 18, 2021, the Company entered into an amended purchase agreement with 4D Bios, Inc. (4D) to secure purchases of horticultural equipment. The original agreement required minimum purchases of between $577 dollars and $607 dollars per unit of 4D products until December 31, 2020. The amended agreement requires minimum purchases of $582 dollars per unit with a final payment of approximately $864 thousand paid to 4D. 4D is a related party to the Company. The Company settled all outstanding commitments, leaving no open committed purchases as of December 31, 2021.\nCommitted Purchase Agreement with Related Party - Ora Pharm\nIn June 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with Ora Pharm (Ora) pursuant to which Ora will purchase approximately $1.6 million in equipment from the Company, and Ora may purchase software services from the Company in the future. Stuart Wilcox, the Companys former Chief Operating Officer, is the Chairman of Ora.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is potentially subject to claims related to various non-income taxes (such as sales, value-added, consumption, and similar taxes) from various tax authorities, including in jurisdictions in which the Company already collects and remits such taxes.

To regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement, the closing bid price of the Companys Common Stock had to be at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days during this 180-day compliance period, unless the Staff exercised its discretion to extend the minimum trading day period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(G).

(Bowdoin) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of Massachusetts in Norfolk County naming the Company, Bud & Marys and certain related parties as defendants. The Bowdoin Complaint relates to a construction contract between Bowdoin and Agrify relating to the property that is the subject of the Bud & Marys Complaint and alleges breach of contract by Bud & Marys and by Agrify due to nonpayment of approximately $7.0 million due under the contract and related indemnification claims and mechanics liens. Certain of Bowdoins subcontractors have filed ancillary civil actions, some seeking direct recovery of sums (which sums are understood to be subsumed in / covered by Bowdoins claims) against the Company. While the Company believes the claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend itself against Bowdoins allegations, litigation is inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in this matter.\nAmendments to Articles of Incorporation\nOn March 1, 2023, the Company filed Articles of Amendment (the Charter Amendment) to its Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State for the State of Nevada.

The Convertible Note will mature on August 19, 2025 and contains a 9.0% annualized interest rate, with interest to be paid monthly, in cash, beginning April 1, 2023.\nConcurrently with the closing under the March 2023 Exchange Agreement, the Company and the lender entered into an Amendment to the Exchange Note (the Note Amendment). Pursuant to the Note Amendment, the Exchange Note was amended to, among other changes, remove covenants that require the Company not to exceed maximum levels of allowable cash spend while the Exchange Note is outstanding and require the Company to maintain minimum amounts of cash on hand.\nOn April 26, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with the above referenced accredited lender (the Letter Agreement), pursuant to which the Company and the lender agreed to exchange $2.0 million of the remaining outstanding principal amount under the Exchange Note for 445,197 shares of common stock of the Company, subject to a Beneficial Ownership Limitation of 4.99% of the Companys Common Stock.\nDiscontinuance of the ATM Program\nAs of April 1, 2023, after which time the ATM Program was discontinued, the Company sold 629,710 shares of Common Stock, under the ATM Program at an average price of $27.29 per share, resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of $17.2 million, and net proceeds of $16.7 million after commissions and fees to the Agent totaling $516 thousand. $3.0 million of the proceeds under the ATM Program were used to repay amounts due to the Investor under the Exchange Note.\nRepricing of Common Stock Warrants\nThe Company issued 1,338,462 common stock warrants in conjunction with the Companys public offering from December, 2022.

Pursuant to the Modification Agreement, the Company and Mack agreed to settle an outstanding dispute under the Supply Agreement between the parties dated December 7, 2020 (the Supply Agreement). The Modification Agreement requires the Company to make payments of $500,000 and $250,000 to Mack on or before November 1, 2023 and February 15, 2024, respectively.

The Company is required to pay a storage fee of $25,000 per month for VFUs subject to the Modification Agreement.\nAdditionally, as part of the Modification Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to Mack a warrant to purchase 750,000 shares of common stock. The warrant has an exercise price of $4.00 per share, was exercisable upon issuance, has a term of three years from the date of issuance, and is exercisable on a cash basis unless at the time of exercise there is no effective registration statement for the resale of the underlying shares, in which case the warrant may be exercised on a cashless exercise basis at Macks election.\nWarrant Issuance\nOn October 27, 2023, the Company entered into a letter agreement with the holder of the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company agreed to exchange $3.0 million in principal and approximately $1.1 million in accrued but unpaid interest outstanding under the Exchange Note to purchase 2,809,669 shares of common stock (the Exchange Warrant). Additionally, the Company agreed to exchange the 375,629 shares of common stock held in abeyance for the lender under the terms of the Letter Agreement for a warrant to purchase 375,629 shares of common stock (the Abeyance Warrant).\nEach warrant has an exercise price of $0.001 per share, was exercisable upon issuance, has a term of five years from the date of issuance and is exercisable on a cash basis or on a cashless exercise basis at the holders election.\nThe Exchange Warrant provides that in the event that Raymond Chang or his affiliates acquire securities from the Company, exercise convertible securities or amend the terms of convertible securities at a purchase or conversion price lower than $1.46, then the number of shares of common stock underlying Exchange Warrant will be increased to an amount equal to $3.0 million divided by such purchase or conversion price, subject to proportional adjustment in the event the Exchange Warrant has been partially exercised. Additionally, in the event that the Company has not issued equity securities in exchange for gross proceeds of at least $3.0 million to Mr. Chang or his affiliates (subject to certain offsets) by the third calendar day after the date when the Company receives stockholder approval, then on December 26, 2023, the number of shares of common stock underlying Exchange Warrant will be increased to an amount equal to $3.0 million divided by the Minimum Price as defined under Nasdaq listing rules, subject to proportional adjustment in the event the Exchange Warrant has been partially exercised.\nThe Letter Agreement requires that the Company issue equity securities to Mr. Chang or his affiliates for aggregate gross proceeds of at least $3.0 million, minus any funds advanced by Mr. Chang to the Company since July 1, 2023.\nNote Purchase\nOn October 27, 2023, CP Acquisitions LLC (the New Lender), an entity affiliated with and controlled by Raymond Chang, the Companys Chief Executive Officer, purchased the Exchange Note and the Convertible Note from their holder.
