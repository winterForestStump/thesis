    "content": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nVestis Corporation (Vestis, the Company, our, we or us) is a leading provider of uniform rentals and workplace supplies across the United States and Canada. We provide uniforms, mats, towels, linens, restroom supplies, first-aid supplies, safety products and other workplace supplies. In fiscal year 2023, we generated revenue of approximately $2.8 billion. We are one of the largest companies operating within the United States and Canada in our industry.\nWe have over 75 years of experience providing uniforms and workplace supplies and a broad footprint that supports efficient delivery of our services and products to more than 300,000 customer locations across the United States and Canada. Our customer base participates in a wide variety of industries including manufacturing, hospitality, retail, food processing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and automotive. We serve customers ranging from small, family-owned operations with a single location to large corporations and national franchises with multiple locations.\nOur customers value the uniforms and workplace supplies we deliver as our services and products can help them reduce operating costs, enhance brand image, maintain a safe and clean workplace and focus on their core business. We provide a full range of uniform programs, managed restroom supply services and first-aid and safety products, as well as ancillary items such as floor mats, towels and linens. Additionally, we provide garments and contamination control supplies that help customers maintain controlled, cleanroom environments commonly used in the manufacturing of electronics, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.\nOur team consists of approximately 20,000 teammates who operate over 350 sites including laundry plants, satellite plants, distribution centers and manufacturing plants. We leverage our broad footprint and our supply chain, delivery fleet and route logistics capabilities to serve customers on a recurring basis, typically weekly, and primarily through multi-year contracts. In addition, we offer customized uniforms through direct sales agreements, typically for large regional or national companies.\nVestis is led by Kim Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Dillon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Angela Kervin, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, Chris Synek, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Timothy Donovan, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel. These executives have deep expertise in their respective fields. They were recruited to lead Vestis as a standalone, independent company and are complemented by long-tenured members of management across the companys commercial and operational functions as well as newly appointed leaders who bring functional expertise, diversity and depth to the Vestis leadership team.\nOn September 30, 2023 (the \"Distribution Date\"), Vestis Corporation completed its spin-off from Aramark (the \"Spin-Off,\" or the Separation). On October 2, 2023 our common stock began regular-way trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol VSTS. Our corporate headquarters are in Roswell, Georgia.\nFinancial Profile\nIn fiscal year 2023, we generated revenue of approximately $2.8 billion, operating income of $217.9 million, or 7.7% of revenue, and net income of $213.2 million, or 7.5% of revenue. Cash provided from operating activities was $257.0 million. Revenue from our recurring rental business comprised 93% of total revenue, with 7% from direct sales. The contracted and recurring nature of our business provides a meaningful level of predictability to annual revenue. Additionally, the diversity of our customer base and the variety of industries in which our customers participate results in relatively low exposure to discrete industry trends. Our revenue is diversified across numerous sectors and customers operating primarily in manufacturing, hospitality, retail, food processing, automotive and healthcare. These are all sectors where we have decades of expertise. Geographically, 91% of our fiscal year 2023 revenue was from sales in the United States, with the remaining 9% from sales in Canada.\nIndustry Overview\nWe operate within the uniforms, mats, towels, linens, restroom supplies, first-aid supplies and safety products industry in the United States and Canada. This includes businesses that outsource these services through rental programs or direct purchases, as well as non-programmers (which are businesses that maintain these services in-house).\nWe believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the various key trends and drivers that are impacting our industry. Demand in this industry is influenced primarily by macro-economic conditions, employment levels, increasing standards for workplace hygiene and safety and an ongoing trend of businesses outsourcing non-core, back-end operations. As noted above, the diversity of our customer base and the variety of industries in which our customers operate results in relatively low exposure to discrete industry trends.\nCompetition\nOur industry is local in nature, fragmented and highly competitive. We believe we are a leading provider within this industry and we compete with national, regional and local providers who vary in size, scale, capabilities and product and service offering. Primary methods of competition include product quality, service quality and price.\nCintas Corporation and UniFirst Corporation are notable competitors of size and we have numerous local and regional competitors. Additionally, many businesses perform certain aspects of our product and service offerings in-house rather than outsourcing them.\nCustomers\nCustomers in our industry value the ability of providers to consistently deliver quality products on-time and with a high level of customer service. Additionally, they value trustworthy suppliers who partner with them to resolve workplace challenges that may arise with timely solutions that meet their needs.\nWe deliver to over 300,000 customer locations across the United States and Canada. We serve customers ranging from small, family-owned operations with a single location to large corporations and national franchises with multiple locations. Our revenue is diversified across our many customers as demonstrated by the revenue generated from our 10 largest customers accounting for less than 10% of total revenue in fiscal year 2023.\nOur customers represent a diverse array of industries including sectors such as manufacturing, hospitality, retail, government, automotive, healthcare and food processing (illustrated in Figure A). The competitive landscape across these sectors for our products and services is highly fragmented and driven primarily by product quality, service quality and pricing of our competitors. We believe our competitive advantages identified below apply to each of the sectors. Across these sectors, we also serve customers who operate cleanrooms, or controlled environments where pollutants like dust, airborne microbes, and aerosol particles are removed to aid in providing clean work environments. Cleanrooms are typically used in the manufacturing of electronics, pharmaceutical products and medical equipment.\nThe diversity of our customers and the wide variety of industries in which they participate results in the demand for our services and products not being specifically linked to the cyclical nature of any one sector.\nThe vast majority of our customers are served under multi-year contracts. While customers are not required to make an up-front investment for their rental uniforms or other rented merchandise, a rental customer typically agrees to pay specified exit costs if it terminates its agreement early without cause.\n__________________\nFigure A: Revenue by Sector for fiscal 2023\nOur Services and Products\nWe provide a full-service uniform solution on a contracted and recurring basis. Our full-service uniform offering includes the design, sourcing, manufacturing, customization, personalization, delivery, laundering, sanitization, repair and replacement of uniforms. Our uniform options include shirts, pants, outerwear, gowns, scrubs, high visibility garments, particulate-free garments and flame-resistant garments, along with shoes and accessories. In addition to uniforms, we also provide workplace supplies including managed restroom supply services, first-aid supplies and safety products, floor mats, towels and linens.\nWe believe our customers value our services and products for a variety of reasons:\nOur full-service programs typically offer a lower-cost solution for customers than if they were serviced in-house, as evidenced by our historical experience and customer feedback, as we leverage our scale and network to achieve procurement and operating efficiencies.\nWe enable customers to focus on operating their core businesses as we take care of their needs for clean uniforms, fully stocked restrooms, complete first-aid kits and other workplace supplies.\nWe help customers establish corporate identity, foster a sense of team and belonging among employees, project a professional image and enhance brand awareness.\nOur uniforms are reusable and can be assigned to another employee (rather than being discarded) when employees transition to new opportunities.\nWe offer a variety of specialty garments that help customers:\n\u25e6adhere to applicable regulatory standards;\n\u25e6safeguard against contamination in the production or service of items such as food, pharmaceuticals and healthcare products;\n\u25e6operate in static-free or low-static environments;\n\u25e6enhance visibility and safety in work environments including construction, utility services, waste management and public safety; and\n\u25e6promote employee safety in workplace environments that involve heavy soils, heat, flame or chemicals in the production process.\nWe service our customers on a recurring basis, typically weekly, delivering clean uniforms and, in the same visit, picking up worn uniforms for inspection, cleaning and repair or replacement (illustrated in Figure B). In addition, we pick up used and soiled floor mats, towels and linens and replace them with clean products. We also restock restroom supplies, first-aid supplies and safety products as needed.\n__________________\nFigure B: Illustrative uniform services weekly process\nFor our cleanroom customers who operate highly regulated and/or contamination-free processes in the healthcare, pharmaceutical and technology industries, we provide advanced static dissipative garments, sterile garments, barrier apparel and cleanroom application accessories.\nWe market and sell our services and products through multiple channels including sales representatives, telemarketing sales channels, our delivery drivers (who we refer to as route service representatives), territory managers and digital platforms.\nOperations and Supply Chain\nWe operate a network of over 350 facilities including laundry plants, satellite plants, distribution centers and manufacturing plants along with a fleet of service vehicles that support over 3,400 pick-up and delivery routes. Our services and products are delivered to customers by route service representatives via delivery routes that originate from one of our laundry plants or satellite sites. Approximately 50% of our uniforms and linens are manufactured in our two manufacturing plants in Mexico. Our Mexican operations include approximately 189,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity and a 107,000 square foot distribution facility.\n__________________\nFigure C: U.S. and Canada geographic service footprint\nWe are committed to operating sustainably with a focus on working to minimize fuel usage on our routes and to minimize energy and water usage in our laundry plant facilities. Additionally, we repair and reuse garments whenever possible to maximize the life cycle of our uniforms and support the circular economy.\nWe source raw materials as well as finished goods from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. Certain of our raw materials and products are currently limited to a single supplier. We maintain a Corporate Social Compliance Policy and related Vendor Code of Conduct both of which require the international manufacturing of our private label garments to occur under safe, lawful and humane working conditions. To support our Corporate Social Compliance Policy, our international private label garment manufacturers confirm annually their commitment to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct. Further, the factories used to produce these products are subject to annual third-party social compliance audits.\nOur Competitive Advantages\nWe believe we have significant competitive advantages including our full-service uniform solution offering, size and scale, extensive network footprint, long-tenured customer relationships and experienced leadership team. Given our robust capabilities, scale and talent, we are well positioned to partner with customers for their future needs across a range of services, use cases and business strategies. Some of our key competitive strengths include:\nFull-Service Uniforms and Workplace Supplies Offering: We offer a full-service uniform solution including the ability to design, source, manufacture, customize, personalize, deliver, launder, sanitize, mend and replace uniforms on a regular and recurring basis. Our uniform offerings include shirts, pants, outerwear, gowns, scrubs, high visibility garments and flame-resistant garments, along with shoes and accessories. In addition to uniforms, we also provide workplace supplies including managed restroom supply services, first-aid supplies and safety products, floor mats, towels, linens and other workplace supplies.\nCritical Scale in Growing, Fragmented Industry: We believe the market opportunity for our services is\nsignificant and growing. We estimate our total addressable market to be approximately $48 billion as of March 31, 2023. Within the United States and Canada, we are the second largest provider in our industry, based on publicly reported information related to revenue, number of employees and facilities data for each of Cintas, Vestis and Unifirst. We believe our size and scale provide a competitive advantage in purchasing power, route density, operating efficiencies and ability to attract and retain talent as compared to smaller local and regional competitors.\nExtensive Network Footprint: We serve over 95% of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and every province in Canada. Our footprint enables us to serve large, national customers across the United States and Canada.\nLong-Tenured Customer Relationships: We deliver to over 300,000 customer locations and serve businesses which participate across numerous industries. We maintain long-term relationships with our customers due to the quality of our services and products, our ability to deliver on-time and our ability to provide workplace supplies and services that support our customers individual strategies and needs.\nA key differentiator in our service model is the relationship between our route service representatives and customers. We work to build relationships and trust through weekly, face-to-face interactions with our customers. Retaining existing customers affords us more opportunities to cross-sell high-value workplace supplies.\nExperienced Leadership Team: The Company is led by Kim Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer, Rick Dillon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Chris Synek, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. These executives have deep experience in their respective areas. They were hired to lead the Company as a standalone, independent company and are complemented by seasoned industry executives across the Companys commercial and operational functions as well as newly appointed leaders who bring functional expertise, diversity and depth to the Companys leadership team.\nMs. Scott has deep and relevant expertise with recurring revenue models having led and operated multiple businesses of this nature over the past 16 years. She also has extensive experience in logistics, route-based distribution and complex rental or subscription-based programs, including in her role as Chief Operating Officer of Terminix. Additionally, she has a broad operating background that includes plant management, logistics, procurement, engineering, acquisitions and large-scale integrations. She joined Aramark in October 2021 as President and CEO of Aramark Uniform Services to develop and launch an accelerated growth and value creation strategy for the company, while also preparing the Company to be a standalone, independent public company.\nMr. Dillon is a seasoned public company executive with more than 20 years of experience in finance leadership roles. Prior to joining Aramark, Mr. Dillon served as the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President of two publicly traded companies, Enerpac Tool Group and Century Aluminum. He joined Aramark in May 2022 to serve as Chief Financial Officer of Aramark Uniform Services and to prepare the Company to be a standalone, independent public company.\nMr. Synek has extensive expertise in leadership roles in related recurring revenue model businesses. Previously, Mr. Synek served as Chief Executive Officer of Neovia Logistics, and President, Transportation North America for XPO Logistics, Inc. Additionally, Mr. Synek spent the first 16 years of his career developing uniform, laundry and workplace services experience at Cintas Corporation, eventually moving on to increasing roles of responsibility at Allied Waste Industries and Republic Services and Tervita Corporation. He joined Aramark in September 2023 to serve as Chief Operating Officer of Aramark Uniform Services.\nOur executive leaders foster a culture of investing in our people, supporting their growth and development, instilling a sense of higher purpose, winning through teamwork with integrity and creating a safe environment for all. In addition, our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion continues to shape our teammate engagement and recruiting efforts.\nValue Creation Strategy\nAs an independent company, we are focused on the development, growth and expansion of our business, with increased flexibility to pursue independent strategic and financial plans, adapt quickly to the changing needs of our customers and sector dynamics, effectively allocate capital to invest in growth areas and accelerate decision-making processes. We are focused on long-term opportunities to make deliveries in our service network more effective, which we expect will drive revenue growth and margin expansion. Our new independence will enable sharper focus on our customers, which we believe will also enhance our competitive positioning and performance.\nOur strategy is focused on creating shareholder value through high-quality and profitable revenue growth that is underpinned by efficient operations and a performance-driven culture. We are pursuing the following key strategies to drive value creation and grow our business:\nHigh-Quality Revenue Growth\nGoing forward, our strategy will continue to focus on retaining customers, with an increased emphasis on increasing revenue per stop through cross-selling, investing in attractive sectors, margin accretive products and service offerings and adding new customers on existing routes to increase our route density. We believe that, by focusing on these areas, we will achieve higher growth rates with more attractive margin profiles.\nCustomer Retention: We serve an attractive, large and long-tenured customer base with services and products that generate recurring revenue streams that typically allow more predictability of revenue than non-recurring revenue business models. We continue to remain focused on retaining these customers, including by ensuring we are delivering new value through new or updated services and products. We will remain focused on modernizing the customer experience to make it easier for our customers to continue to do business with us. This includes investments in new technology, such as sophisticated, digital customer portals, as well as investments in our customer service process to enhance our route check-in process and predictive analytics that help us better anticipate customer service opportunities.\nIncreasing Revenue Per Stop Through Cross-Selling to Leverage Fixed Costs: On average, our current customers take advantage of approximately 30% to 40% of our full line of services and products. We believe there is a significant opportunity to increase our wallet share with our existing customers through cross-selling additional services and products, including compelling adjacent services such as first aid and managed restroom services. This is expected to result in high-margin growth with existing customers by increasing revenue per stop and leveraging our existing delivery costs. We have invested in tools to support our trusted and tenured route service representative teammates and we are incentivizing them to pursue these opportunities with our existing customer base.\nTargeting Attractive Sectors, Services and Products: We are implementing more targeted sales strategies to drive growth across high-value sectors, services and products. Using enhanced data analytics and insights will enable us to focus on customer wins that improve our revenue mix.\nIncreasing Route Density: We are establishing route density metrics to target sales along existing customer routes. We will focus on implementing analytical and geographical prospecting tools that will aid and reward our sales representatives for delivering growth that increases route density and lowers our overall cost to serve per route.\nEfficient Operations\nOur operations currently include significant cost inputs in areas such as labor, merchandise in service costs, plant operating costs and service-related costs. We are working to instill a continuous improvement mindset in our teammates by instituting disciplined, financial metrics and reporting, key performance indicator monitoring and strengthening our leadership in key functional areas such as supply chain, logistics and plant operations.\nIn our collaboration with new function leaders, we have identified key areas of opportunity to reduce our operating costs and expand margins across our business:\nNetwork Optimization: A comprehensive analysis of our plant network and customer flows (route movements from plant to customer) has revealed a significant opportunity throughout our network to lower our cost to serve. Further, we have identified a portfolio of initiatives related to routing and scheduling efficiencies and transport and logistics improvements. We believe we can deliver margin expansion through this flow optimization.\nWorkforce Management: We are working to reduce our labor costs by decreasing frontline turnover to improve plant productivity, reducing general and administrative costs and improving plant operations.\nMerchandise Inventory Management: We are focused on lowering merchandise in service costs across our system in order to improve the profitability of new and existing business. Examples include delivering higher levels of garment and product reuse to reduce the issuance of new products and supply chain procurement strategies to reduce purchasing costs.\nPerformance-Driven Culture\nFostering a performance-driven culture is essential to the delivery of high-quality revenue growth and margin expansion. We are focused on further strengthening our capabilities and enhancing competencies in functional areas that\nare core to the delivery of our strategy such as sales and marketing, pricing, procurement, logistics, technology, talent acquisition and retention and plant operations. We have invested across these areas over the past year and will continue to strengthen these teams to support our strategy. We will make decisions that are informed by data and implement performance measurements and incentives that are aligned with the achievement of our strategic objectives.\nHuman Capital Resources\nOur success begins with our people, and ensuring a safe workplace is our first priority. Investing in, developing and caring for our teammates is paramount to retaining our teammates. We believe serving our teammates in this manner significantly improves our ability to serve and retain customers, accelerate profitable growth and enhance productivity. This requires an unwavering commitment to safety, diversity and inclusion, professional growth opportunities and competitive total compensation and benefits that meet the needs of our teammates and their families.\nWe have approximately 20,000 teammates, primarily based in the United States, Canada and Mexico. As of September 29, 2023, approximately 10,500 of our teammates were represented by labor unions. We work to maintain productive working relationships with these unions.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that it is beneficial to align our diversity, equity and inclusion priorities with our business strategy.\nAs of September 29, 2023, 75% of our Board of Directors is from underrepresented groups, including females who represent 63% of our Board of Directors. Additionally, 80% of our named executive officers are from underrepresented groups including females, who represent 40% of our named executive officers; 67% of our executive officers are from underrepresented groups including females who represent 33% of our executive officers; and 45% of our senior leadership team are from underrepresented groups including females, who represent 32% of our senior leadership team. Continuing to increase diversity in executive and all levels of the leadership pipeline remains an organizational priority for the coming years. We will have multiple employee resource groups; examples include those supporting women, racially and ethnically diverse employees and the LGBTQ+ community.\nTalent Acquisition, Development and Retention. Hiring, developing and retaining teammates is critically important to our operations and we are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster growth, performance and retention. We sponsor training and education programs for our teammates, from hourly teammates to upper levels of management, designed to enhance leadership and managerial capability, help ensure quality execution of our programs, drive customer satisfaction and increase return on investment.\nCommunity Engagement. Through Aramarks legacy, we have a strong culture of community engagement. As we move forward as an independent, standalone company, we will continue to embrace that legacy and build upon it by developing a community engagement program unique to our business that is aligned with our strategy, teammates, the customers we serve and the communities where we operate.\nCompensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness. In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to our teammates. Our core health and welfare benefits are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions and include a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide programs designed to promote physical, emotional and financial well-being.\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business is subject to various federal, state, international, national, provincial and local laws and regulations, in areas such as environmental, labor, employment, immigration, privacy and data security, tax, transportation, health and safety, antitrust, anti-corruption, import/export, consumer protection, false claims and lobby and procurement laws. In addition, our facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state, provincial, local and international authorities. We have various controls and procedures designed to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our compliance requirements are subject to legislative changes, or changes in regulatory interpretation, implementation or enforcement. If we fail to comply with applicable laws, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, penalties, damages, reimbursement, injunctions, seizures, disgorgements or debarments from government contracts.\nOur business is subject to various environmental protection laws and regulations, including the United States Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and similar local, provincial, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the use, treatment, management, transportation, and disposal of wastes and hazardous materials.\nWe use and manage chemicals and hazardous materials as part of our operations. We are mindful of the environmental concerns surrounding the use, treatment, management, transportation and disposal of these chemicals and hazardous materials, and have taken and continue to take measures to comply with environmental protection laws and regulations. In particular, industrial laundries generate wastewater, air emissions and related wastes as part of operations relating to the laundering of garments and other merchandise. Residues removed from soiled garments and other merchandise laundered at our facilities and from detergents and chemicals used in our wash process may be contained in discharges to air and water (through sanitary sewer systems and publicly owned treatment works) and in waste generated by our wastewater treatment systems. Similar to other companies in our industry, our industrial laundries are subject to certain air and water pollution discharge limits, monitoring, permitting and recordkeeping requirements. Wastewater at our laundry facilities is treated as necessary to comply with local discharge requirements and permits prior to discharge to sanitary sewer systems or publicly owned treatment works. We also own or operate a limited number of aboveground and underground storage tank systems at some locations to store petroleum or propane for use in our operations. Certain of these storage tank systems are subject to performance standards, periodic monitoring, and recordkeeping requirements.\nGiven the regulated nature of some of our operations, we could face penalties and fines for non-compliance. In the past, we have settled, or contributed to the settlement of, actions or claims relating to the management of underground storage tanks and the handling and disposal of chemicals or hazardous materials, either on- or off-site. We may, in the future, be required to expend material amounts to rectify the consequences of any such events. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous materials located on or in or migrating from our owned or leased property or located at sites that we operated in the past or to which we have sent waste for off-site disposal, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws may impose liability without regard to our fault, knowledge or responsibility for the presence of such hazardous materials. We may not know whether our acquired or leased properties have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that our future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. We routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring. Based on these reviews and various estimates and assumptions, we determine our estimated costs. As of September 29, 2023, we do not anticipate any expenditures for environmental remediation that would have a material effect on our financial condition. While environmental compliance is not a material component of our costs, we invest in equipment, technology and operating expenses, primarily for water treatment and waste removal, on a regular basis in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations, to promote the safety of our teammates, customers, and communities and to enhance the sustainability of our operations.\nIntellectual Property\nWe have patents, trademarks, trade names and licenses that support the operation of our business. Historically, the Aramark brand, including its corporate starperson logo design, and the Aramark word mark have been used to market our business. In connection with the Separation, we will be repositioning our new Vestis brand to better represent our customer value proposition and value creation strategy as an independent, standalone uniform rental and workplace supplies company. We anticipate the repositioning of our brand will occur in stages, over time, and we intend to use trade advertising and targeted digital marketing to promote recognition of our brand.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (ESG)\nWe have been engaged in actively supporting environmental, social and governance (ESG) efforts. Below are key areas of focus the Company has undertaken and intends to continue to pursue:\nWe maintain a Corporate Social Compliance Policy and related Vendor Code of Conduct that address the international manufacturing of our private label garments under safe, lawful and humane working conditions. To support our Corporate Social Compliance Policy, our international private label garment manufacturers annually confirm their commitment to comply with our Vendor Code of Conduct, and the factories used to produce these products are subject to annual third-party social compliance audits.\nWe have made enhancements to our wash chemistry that allow us to conserve electricity, natural gas and water. Our most recent chemical enhancement has provided utility resource reductions with shorter washing machine run times (electricity), reduced water temperatures (natural gas) and fewer rinse cycles (water).\nWe focus on the efficient use of fossil fuels to reduce related emissions. We seek to increase route efficiency with technology and processes that reduce travel time, distance and fuel consumption. For example, our new telematics technology allows us to proactively reduce fuel usage by limiting idling through real-time, in-cab driver alerts.\nOur Board of Directors and executive leadership are committed to leading a socially responsible organization that supports the health of our planet, cares for our employees, invests in the communities we work in and conducts business in an ethical manner with appropriate governance. Our Board of Directors will oversee our ESG goals and objectives, and will support the implementation of our ESG priorities and commitments.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports as well as other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Our principal internet address is www.vestis.com where we make available free of charge our annual, quarterly and current reports, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The references to our website and the SEC's website are intended to be inactive textual references only and the contents of those websites are not incorporated by reference herein. Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K in evaluating Vestis and Vestiss common stock. Any of the following risks and uncertainties could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOperational Risks\nUnfavorable economic conditions have in the past adversely affected, are currently adversely affecting and in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nUnfavorable economic conditions may arise during times of national and international economic downturns, or may be attributed to natural disasters, calamities, public health crises, political unrest and global conflicts. Unfavorable economic conditions may also contribute to supply chain disruptions, geopolitical events, global energy shortages, major central bank policy actions including interest rate increases, public health crises or other factors. Unfavorable economic conditions could adversely affect the demand for our products and services. For example, in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were negatively affected by reduced employment levels at our customers locations and declining levels of business and customer spending. In addition, adverse economic conditions, including increases in labor costs, labor shortages, higher materials and other costs, supply chain disruptions, inflation and other economic factors could increase our costs of selling and providing the products and services we offer, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, the impact of inflation on various areas of our business, including labor and product costs, has recently affected our business, financial condition or results of operations, and we may not be able to mitigate any future impacts of inflation by increases in pricing for our goods and services. We are unable to predict any future trends in the rate of inflation, and if (and to the extent that) we are unable to recover higher costs in the event of future increases in inflation, such increases in inflation could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nConditions or events that adversely affect our current customers or sales prospects may cause such customers or prospects to restrict expenditures, reduce workforces or even to cease to conduct their businesses. Any of these circumstances would have the effect of reducing the number of employees utilizing our uniform services, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, financial distress and insolvency experienced by customers, especially larger customers, has in the past made it difficult and in the future could make it difficult for us to collect amounts we are owed and could result in the voiding, termination or modification of\nexisting contracts. For example, in response to the changed circumstances caused by shutdowns earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic, we worked with customers to renegotiate contracts in order to mitigate lost revenues caused by partial or full closure of customer premises. Similarly, financial distress or insolvency, if experienced by our key vendors and service providers such as insurance carriers, could significantly increase our costs.\nIncreases in fuel and energy costs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe prices of fuel and energy to run our vehicles, equipment and facilities are volatile and fluctuate based on factors outside of our control. For example, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has disrupted supply chains and caused increases in fuel prices. Our operating margins have been and may continue to be impacted by such increased fuel prices. Continuing or additional increases in fuel and energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or our results of operations.\nOur failure to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts on comparable terms and obtain new customer contracts could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain our current customers, renew our existing customer contracts and obtain new business on commercially favorable terms. Our ability to do so generally depends on a variety of factors, including the quality, price and responsiveness of our services, as well as our ability to market these services effectively and differentiate ourself from our competitors. In addition, customers are increasingly focused on and requiring us to set targets and meet standards related to environmental sustainability matters, such as greenhouse gas emissions, packaging, waste and wastewater. When we renew existing customer contracts, it is often on terms that are less favorable or less profitable for us than the then-current contract terms. In addition, we typically incur substantial start-up and operating costs and experiences lower profit margin and operating cash flows in connection with the establishment of new business, and in periods with higher rates of new business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience negative impact to our profit margin and our cash flows. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new business, renew existing customer contracts at the same or higher levels of pricing or that our current customers will not turn to competitors, cease operations, elect to in-source or terminate contracts with us. These risks may be exacerbated by current economic conditions due to, among other things, increased cost pressure at our customers, tight labor markets and heightened competition in a contracted marketplace. The failure to renew a significant number of our existing contracts, including on the same or more favorable terms, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the failure to obtain new business could have an adverse impact on our growth and financial results.\nNatural disasters, global calamities, climate change, political unrest and other adverse incidents beyond our control could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNatural disasters, including hurricanes and earthquakes, global calamities and political unrest have affected, and in the future could affect, our business, financial condition or results of operations. In the past, due to more geographically isolated natural disasters, such as wildfires in the western United States and hurricanes and extreme cold conditions in the southern United States, we experienced lost and closed customer locations, business disruptions and delays, the loss of inventory and other assets, and asset impairments. The effects of global climate change will likely increase the frequency and severity of such natural disasters and may also impact the availability of water resources, forests or other natural resources.\nIn addition, political unrest and global conflicts like the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine have disrupted, and in the future may further continue to disrupt, global supply chains and heighten volatility and disruption of global financial markets. While we do not have direct operations within Russia or Ukraine, the conflict involving these nations has heightened the disruption to our supply chain, triggered inflation in our labor costs and may increase our risk of cyberattacks. We do not have direct operations in the Middle East but the recent Israel-Hamas War and escalating tensions in the region may disrupt global markets and impact our supply chain. The impact of these global events on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, our response and governmental response to inflation, and the duration and severity of the conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East. Any terrorist attacks or incidents prompted by political unrest also may adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nCompetition in our industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe uniform apparel and workplace supply services industry is highly competitive. We face competition from major national competitors with significant financial resources. In addition, there are regional and local uniform suppliers whom we believe have strong customer loyalty. The primary areas of competition within the industry are price, design, quality of products and quality of services. While many customers focus primarily on quality of service, uniform rental is also a price-sensitive service and if existing or future competitors seek to gain customers or accounts by reducing prices, we may be required to lower prices, which would reduce our revenue and profits. Our industry competitors are also competitors for acquisitions, which may increase the cost of acquisitions or lower the number of potential targets. The uniform rental business requires investment capital for growth. Failure to maintain capital investment in this business would put us at a competitive disadvantage. In addition, to maintain a cost structure that allows for competitive pricing, it is important for us to source garments and other products internationally. To the extent we are not able to effectively source such products internationally and gain the related cost savings, we may be at a disadvantage in relation to some of our competitors. An increase in competition, from any of the foregoing or other sources, may require us to reduce prices and/or result in reduced profits and loss of market share, which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected if customers reduce their outsourcing or use of preferred vendors.\nOur business and growth strategies depend in large part on the continuation of a current trend toward outsourcing services. Customers will outsource if they perceive that outsourcing may provide quality services at a lower overall cost and permit them to focus on their core business activities. We cannot be certain this trend will continue or not be reversed or that customers that have outsourced functions will not decide to perform these functions themselves. Unfavorable developments with respect to either outsourcing or the use of preferred vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks associated with our suppliers and service providers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe raw materials we use in our business and the finished products we sell are sourced from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. We seek to require our suppliers and service providers to comply with applicable laws and otherwise meet our quality and/or conduct standards. In addition, customer and stakeholder expectations regarding environmental, social and governance consideration for suppliers are evolving. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and to access raw materials and finished products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge, especially with respect to suppliers located and goods sourced outside the United States.\nInsolvency or business disruption experienced by suppliers could make it difficult for us to source the items we need to run our business. Political and economic stability in the countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers failure to meet our standards, labor problems experienced by our suppliers, the availability of raw materials and labor to suppliers, cybersecurity issues, currency exchange rates, transport availability and cost, tariffs, inflation and other factors relating to the suppliers and the countries in which they are located are beyond our control. Certain of our raw materials and products are currently and may in the future be limited to a single supplier, and if such a supplier faces any difficulty in supplying the materials or products, we may not be able to find an alternative supplier in a timely manner or at all. Current global supply chain disruptions caused by the current macroeconomic environment, the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia/Ukraine conflict have resulted, and may continue to result, in delivery delays as well as lower fill rates and higher substitution rates for a wide-range of products. We do not have direct operations in the Middle East but the recent Israel-Hamas War and escalating tensions in the region may disrupt global markets and impact our supply chain. While we have continued to modify our business model in response to the current environment, including proactively managing inflation and global supply chain disruption, through supply chain initiatives and by implementing pricing, including temporary fees, as appropriate, to cover incremental costs, there is no guarantee that we will be able to continue to do so successfully or on comparable terms in the future if supply chain disruptions continue or worsen.\nDomestic foreign trade policies, tariffs and other impositions on imported goods, trade sanctions imposed on certain countries, the limitation on the importation of certain types of goods or of goods containing certain materials from other countries and other factors relating to foreign trade are beyond our control. If one of our suppliers were to violate the law, or engage in conduct that results in adverse publicity, our reputation may be harmed simply due to our association with that supplier. Drought, flood, natural disasters and other extreme weather events caused by climate change or other\nenvironmental conditions could also result in supply chain disruptions. These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to raw materials and finished products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur contracts may be subject to challenge by our customers, which, if determined adversely, could affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is contract-intensive, and we are party to many contracts with customers. From time to time, our customers may challenge our contract terms or our interpretation of our contract terms. These challenges could result in disputes between us and our customers. The resolution of these disputes in a manner adverse to our interests could negatively affect revenue and operating results. If a large number of our customer arrangements were modified in response to any such matter, the effect could be materially adverse to our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur expansion strategy involves risks.\nWe may seek to acquire companies or interests in companies, or enter into joint ventures that complement our business. Our inability to complete acquisitions, integrate acquired companies successfully or enter into joint ventures may render us less competitive. Our ability to engage in acquisitions, joint ventures and related business opportunities may be subject to additional limitations due to the Separation.\nAt any given time, we may be evaluating one or more acquisitions or engaging in acquisition negotiations. We cannot be sure that we will be able to continue to identify acquisition candidates or joint venture partners on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we make acquisitions, we also cannot be sure that any benefits anticipated from the acquisitions will actually be realized. Likewise, we cannot be sure we will be able to obtain necessary financing for acquisitions. Such financing could be restricted by the terms of our debt agreements or it could be more expensive than our current debt. The amount of such debt financing for acquisitions could be significant and the terms of such debt instruments could be more restrictive than our current covenants. In addition, our ability to control the planning and operations of our joint ventures and other less than majority-owned affiliates may be subject to numerous restrictions imposed by the joint venture agreements and majority stockholders. Our joint venture partners may also have interests which differ from ours.\nThe process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in operating, contract and supply chain difficulties, such as the failure to retain existing customers or attract new customers, maintain relationships with suppliers and other contractual parties, or retain and integrate acquired personnel. In addition, cost savings that we expect to achieve, for example, from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale or synergies, may take longer than expected to realize or may ultimately be smaller than we expect. Also, in connection with any acquisition, we could fail to discover liabilities of the acquired company for which we may be responsible as a successor owner or operator in spite of any investigation we make prior to the acquisition, or significant compliance issues which require remediation, resulting in additional unanticipated costs, risk creation and potential reputational harm. In addition, labor laws in certain countries may require us to retain more employees than would otherwise be optimal from entities we acquire. Such integration difficulties may divert significant financial, operational and managerial resources from our existing operations and make it more difficult to achieve our operating and strategic objectives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similarly, our business depends on effective information technology and financial reporting systems. Delays in or poor execution of the integration of these systems could disrupt our operations and increase costs, and could also potentially adversely impact the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting.\nPossible future acquisitions could also result in additional contingent liabilities and amortization expenses related to intangible assets being incurred, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business combinations represent a significant portion of our assets. If goodwill or other intangible assets were deemed to be impaired, we would need to take a charge to earnings to write down these assets to their fair value.\nOur international business faces risks that could have an effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe operate primarily in the United States and Canada. During fiscal 2023, approximately 91% of our revenue was generated in the United States and approximately 9% of our revenue was generated in Canada. In addition, we operate\nmanufacturing plants and a distribution center in Mexico that collectively employ approximately 2,000 personnel as of September 29, 2023. Our international operations are subject to risks that are different from those we face in the United States, including the requirement to comply with changing or conflicting national and local regulatory requirements and laws, as well as cybersecurity, data protection and supply chain laws; potential difficulties in staffing and labor disputes; managing and obtaining support and distribution for local operations; credit risk or financial condition of local customers; potential imposition of restrictions on investments; potentially adverse tax consequences, including imposition or increase of withholding, value-added tax (VAT) and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries; foreign exchange controls; local political and social conditions; and the ability to comply with the terms of government assistance programs.\nThe operating results of our international subsidiaries (which are currently primarily in Canada) are translated into U.S. dollars and such results are affected by movements in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Recently, the strength of the U.S. dollar has generally increased as compared to other currencies (including the Canadian dollar), which has had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our operating results as reported in U.S. dollars.\nWe own and operate facilities in Mexico. Violence, crime and instability in Mexico may have an adverse effect on our operations. We are not insured against such criminal attacks and there can be no assurance that losses that could result from an attack on our trucks or personnel would not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may continue to consider opportunities to develop our business in emerging countries over the long term. Emerging international operations present several additional risks, including greater fluctuation in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar; economic and governmental instability; civil disturbances; volatility in gross domestic production; and nationalization and expropriation of private assets.\nThere can be no assurance that the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor-Related Risks\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient qualified personnel or if labor costs increase.\nWe believe much of our future growth and success depends on the continued availability, service and well-being of entry level personnel. We have had and may continue to have difficulty in hiring and retaining qualified personnel, particularly at the entry level. We will continue to have significant requirements to hire such personnel. At times when the United States or other geographic regions experience reduced levels of unemployment or a general scarcity of labor as has been seen in recent periods, there may be a shortage of qualified workers at all levels. Given that our workforce requires large numbers of entry level and skilled workers and managers, a general difficulty finding sufficient employees or mismatches between the labor markets and our skill requirements can compromise our ability in certain areas of our businesses to continue to provide quality service or compete for new business. We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Compliance and claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Competition for labor has at times resulted in wage increases in the past and future competition could substantially increase our labor costs. Due to the labor-intensive nature of our businesses, a shortage of labor or increases in wage levels in excess of normal levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nContinued or further unionization of our workforce may increase our costs and work stoppages could damage our business.\nAs of September 29, 2023, approximately 10,500 of our employees were represented by labor unions and covered by over 200 collective bargaining agreements with various terms and dates of expiration. There can be no assurance that any current or future issues with our employees will be resolved or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions or our employees. A work stoppage or other limitations on our operations and facilities for any reason could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe continued or further unionization of our workforce could increase our overall costs and adversely affect our flexibility to run our business in the most efficient manner, to remain competitive and acquire new business. In addition,\nany significant increase in the number of work stoppages at any of our operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may incur significant liability as a result of our participation in multiemployer-defined benefit pension plans.\nA number of our locations operate under collective bargaining agreements. Under some of these agreements, we are obligated to contribute to multiemployer-defined benefit pension plans. As a contributing employer to such plans, should we trigger either a complete or partial withdrawal, or should the plan experience a mass withdrawal, we could be subject to withdrawal liability for our proportionate share of any unfunded, vested benefits which may exist for the particular plan. In addition, if a multiemployer-defined benefit pension plan fails to satisfy the minimum funding standards, we could be liable to increase our contributions to meet minimum funding standards. Also, if another participating employer withdraws from the plan or experiences financial difficulty, including bankruptcy, our obligation could increase. The financial status of a small number of the plans to which we contribute has deteriorated in the recent past and continues to deteriorate. We proactively monitor the financial status of these and the other multiemployer-defined benefit pension plans in which we participate. In addition, any increased funding obligations for underfunded multiemployer-defined benefit pension plans could have an adverse financial impact on us.\nLegal, Regulatory, Safety and Security Risks\nIf we fail to comply with requirements imposed by applicable law or other governmental regulations, we could become subject to lawsuits, investigations and other liabilities and restrictions on our operations that could significantly and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local levels in many areas of our business, such as employment laws, wage and hour laws, discrimination laws, immigration laws, human health and safety laws, import and export controls and customs laws, environmental laws, false claims or whistleblower statutes, tax codes, antitrust and competition laws, customer protection statutes, procurement regulations, intellectual property laws, supply chain laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-corruption laws, lobbying laws, motor carrier safety laws and data privacy and security laws. We are, from time to time, subject to varied and changing rules and regulations at the federal, state, international, national, provincial and local level, including vaccine and testing mandates, capacity limitations and cleaning and sanitation standards, which may in the future impact our operations across customer locations and business sectors.\nFrom time to time, government agencies have conducted reviews and audits of certain of our practices as part of routine inquiries of providers of services under government contracts, or otherwise. Like others in our industry, we also receive requests for information from government agencies in connection with these reviews and audits.\nWhile we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws, regulations or interpretations of these laws and regulations.\nGovernment agencies may make changes in the regulatory frameworks within which we operate that may require us to incur substantial increases in costs in order to comply with such laws and regulations. For example, during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses, such as ours, were subject to new, varied and evolving rules and regulations at all levels of government, including vaccine and testing mandates, capacity limitations, cleaning and sanitation standards and travel restrictions, which have impacted, and may in the future, materially impact our operations.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those referred to above, we may be subject to investigations, criminal sanctions or civil remedies, including fines, penalties, damages, reimbursement, injunctions, seizures, disgorgements or debarments from government contracts or the loss of the ability to operate our motor vehicles. The cost of compliance or the consequences of non-compliance, including debarments, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm.\nEnvironmental regulations may subject us to significant liability and limit our ability to grow.\nWe use and manage chemicals and hazardous materials as part of our operations. We are subject to various environmental protection laws and regulations, including the United States Federal Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and\nsimilar local, provincial, state, federal and international laws and regulations governing the use, treatment, management, transportation, and disposal of wastes and hazardous materials. We are mindful of the environmental concerns surrounding the use, treatment, management, transportation and disposal of these chemicals and hazardous materials, and have taken and continue to take measures to comply with environmental protection laws and regulations.\nIn particular, industrial laundries generate wastewater, air emissions and related wastes as part of operations relating to the laundering of garments and other merchandise. Residues removed from soiled garments and other merchandise laundered at our facilities and from detergents and chemicals used in our wash process may be contained in discharges to air and water (through sanitary sewer systems and publicly owned treatment works) and in waste generated by our wastewater treatment systems. Similar to other companies in our industry, our industrial laundries are subject to certain air and water pollution discharge limits, monitoring, permitting and recordkeeping requirements.\nWe also own or operate a limited number of aboveground and underground storage tank systems at some locations to store petroleum or propane for use in our operations. Certain of these storage tank systems are subject to performance standards, periodic monitoring and recordkeeping requirements. We also use and manage hazardous materials, chemicals and wastes in our operations from time to time. In the course of our business, we may be subject to penalties and fines and reputational harm for non-compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations, and we may settle, or contribute to the settlement of, actions or claims relating to the handling and disposal of wastes or hazardous materials. We may, in the future, be required to expend material financial amounts to rectify the consequences of any such events.\nIn addition, changes to environmental laws may subject us to additional costs or cause us to change aspects of our business. In particular, new laws and regulations related to climate change (including, but not limited to, certain requirements relating to the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions and associated business risks), could affect our operations or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on us. Under environmental laws, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous materials located on or in or migrating from our owned or leased property or located at sites that we operated in the past or to which we have sent waste for off-site disposal, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. Such laws may impose liability without regard to our fault, knowledge, or responsibility for the presence of such hazardous materials. There can be no assurance that locations that we own, lease, or otherwise operate or operated in the past, or that we may acquire in the future, have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon us under such laws or expose us to third-party actions such as tort suits. In addition, such regulations may limit our ability to identify suitable sites for new or expanded facilities. In connection with our present or past operations, including those by companies that we have acquired, hazardous substances may migrate from properties on which we operate or which were operated by our predecessors or companies we acquired to other properties. We may be subject to significant liabilities to the extent that human health is adversely affected or the value of such properties is diminished by such migration.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess each of our environmental sites to determine whether the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental conditions are probable and can be reasonably estimated as well as the adequacy of our reserves with respect to such costs. There can be no assurance that our reserves with respect to our environmental sites will be sufficient or that the costs of remediation and investigation will not substantially exceed our reserves as new facts, circumstances or estimates arise.\nUnanticipated changes in tax law could adversely impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions within which we conduct business. Considering the unpredictability of changes to tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, it is difficult to estimate the potential adverse impact of these changes on our business and financial results. Changes in tax laws or regulations in these jurisdictions could increase our effective tax rate, restrict our ability to repatriate undistributed foreign earnings, or impose new restrictions, costs or prohibitions that could reduce our net income and adversely affect our cash flows.\nAdditionally, we may be under examination by the taxing authorities for historical tax positions, and we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these audits. While we believe that our current tax provisions are appropriate, there can be no assurance that these items will be settled for the amounts accrued, that additional tax exposures will not be identified in the future or that additional tax reserves will not be necessary for any such exposure. Any increase\nin the amount of taxation incurred as a result of challenges to our tax filing positions could result in a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.\nOur operations and reputation may be adversely affected by disruptions to or breaches of our information systems or if our data is otherwise compromised.\nWe are increasingly utilizing information technology systems, including with respect to administrative functions, financial and operational data, ordering, point-of-sale processing and payment and the management of our supply chain, to enhance the efficiency of our business and to improve the overall experience of our customers. We maintain confidential, proprietary and personal information about, or on behalf of, our potential, current and former customers, employees and other third parties in these systems or engage third parties in connection with storage and processing of this information. Such information includes employee, customer and third-party data, including credit card numbers, social security numbers, healthcare information and other personal information.\nOur systems and the systems of our vendors and other third parties are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer or telecommunication failures, computer viruses, catastrophic events and implementation delays or difficulties, as well as usage errors by our employees or third-party service providers. These systems are also vulnerable to an increasing threat of rapidly evolving cyber-based attacks, including malicious software, attempts to deny access to systems or networks, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, including through phishing emails, attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information, the exploitation of software and operating vulnerabilities and physical device tampering/skimming at card reader units. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect for a long time and often are not recognized until after an attack is launched or occurs. As a result, we and such third parties may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. In addition, we or such third parties may decide to upgrade existing information technology systems from time to time to support the needs of our business and growth strategy and the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken.\nWe intend to maintain a global cybersecurity program governed by an information security management system aligned with ISO27001. We have established and maintain a cross-functional Cyber Governance Committee that will be responsible for prioritizing and managing evolving cyber risks. During the normal course of business, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-based attacks and other attempts to compromise our information systems, although none, to our knowledge, has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny damage to, or compromise or breach of, our systems or the systems of our vendors could impair our ability to conduct our business, result in transaction errors, result in corruption or loss of accounting or other data, which could cause delays in our financial reporting, and result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, significant legal and financial exposure, reputational damage, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures. Any such event could cause us to incur substantial costs, including costs associated with systems remediation, customer protection, litigation, lost revenue or the failure to retain or attract customers following an attack. The failure to properly respond to any such event could also result in similar exposure to liability. While we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain aspects of cyber risks, such insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, as cybersecurity risks evolve, such insurance may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The occurrence of some or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and reputation.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the United States and internationally as well as contractual obligations and other security standards, each designed to protect the personal information of customers, employees and other third parties that we collect and maintain. These laws and regulations are evolving to match changes in cyber-attacks and protection programs, which require us to review and amend the legal framework we have in place.\nBecause we accept debit and credit cards for payment from customers, we are also subject to various industry data protection standards and protocols, such as payment network security operating guidelines and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. In certain circumstances, payment card association rules and obligations make us liable to payment card issuers if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we hold is compromised, the liabilities for which could be substantial.\nThese laws, regulations and obligations are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and may be inconsistent across the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Additionally, the federal government and some states have adopted, are considering or in the future may adopt similar data protection laws. Our systems and the systems maintained or used by third parties and service providers to process data on our behalf may not be able to satisfy these changing legal and regulatory requirements, or may require significant additional investments or time to do so. If we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, we could be subject to significant litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions and we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and business.\nWe expect that stakeholder expectations relating to environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations may expose us to liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.\nWe, along with many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders, are increasingly focused on ESG considerations relating to our business, including greenhouse gas emissions, human and civil rights and diversity, equity and inclusion. New laws and regulations in these areas have been proposed and may be adopted, and the criteria used by regulators and other relevant stakeholders to evaluate our ESG practices, capabilities and performance may change rapidly, which in each case could require us to undertake costly initiatives or operational changes. Non-compliance with these emerging rules or standards or a failure to address regulator, stakeholder and societal expectations may result in potential cost increases, litigation, fines, penalties, production and sales restrictions, brand or reputational damage, loss of customers, suppliers and commercial partners, failure to retain and attract talent, lower valuation and higher investor activism activities. In addition, we may make statements about our ESG goals and initiatives through periodic financial and non-financial reports, information provided on our website, press statements and other communications. Managing these considerations and implementing these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, including increased costs, requires investments and often depends on third-party performance or data that is outside our control. We cannot guarantee that we will achieve any ESG goals and initiatives we may announce, satisfy all stakeholder expectations, or that the benefits of implementing or achieving these goals and initiatives will not surpass their projected costs. Any failure, or perceived failure, to achieve ESG goals and initiatives, as well as to manage ESG risks, adhere to public statements, comply with federal, state or international ESG laws and regulations or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business, including personal injury, customer contract, environmental and employment claims. Certain of these lawsuits or potential future lawsuits, if decided adversely to us or settled by us, may result in liability and expense material to our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nWe have debt obligations that could adversely affect our business and profitability and our ability to meet other obligations.\nWe entered into a Credit Agreement in fiscal 2023 and completed financing transactions and as a result of such transactions we have approximately $1,500 million of indebtedness. We entered into senior secured financing with a syndicate of banks, financial institutions and/or other institutional lenders, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. acting as the administrative agent and the collateral agent, in an aggregate amount of $1,800 million, consisting of the Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan Facilities mature no more than five years from the date thereof. Interest on the loans under the Credit Facilities is to be calculated by reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin, which in the case of any SOFR loan will include a customary spread adjustment. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for definitions for the Credit Agreement, Term Loan Facilities, Revolving Credit Facility, and Credit Facilities.\nThis significant amount of debt could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors, including:\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities;\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\nincreasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\nreducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\nlimiting our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise.\nTo the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the foregoing risks could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to refinance our debt.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly and potentially limit our ability to effectively refinance our indebtedness as it matures.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase and we do not hedge such variable rates, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed will remain the same, which will negatively impact our net income and operating cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness.\nAdditionally, our ability to refinance portions of our indebtedness in advance of their maturity dates depends on securing new financing bearing interest at rates that we are able to service. While we believe that we currently have adequate cash flows to service the interest rates currently applicable to our indebtedness, if interest rates were to continue to rise significantly, we might be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to meet our debt service obligations at such increased rates.\nIf our financial performance were to deteriorate, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our\nindebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. While we believe that we currently have adequate cash flows to service our indebtedness, if our financial performance were to deteriorate significantly, we might be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf, due to such a deterioration in our financial performance, our cash flows and capital resources were to be insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be\nsuccessful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, if we were required to raise additional capital in the current financial markets, the terms of such financing, if available, could result in higher costs and greater restrictions on our business. In addition, if we were to need to refinance our existing indebtedness, the conditions in the financial markets at that time could make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all. If such alternative measures proved unsuccessful, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. Our Credit Agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from any disposition of assets and to refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur Credit Agreement contains various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our and our restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:\nincur additional indebtedness, refinance or restructure indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares;\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of our capital stock;\nmake certain investments;\nsell certain assets;\ncreate liens;\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, our Credit Agreement requires us to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and, in the event of a significant deterioration of our financial performance, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy those ratios and tests. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement. Upon our failure to maintain compliance with these covenants that is not waived by the lenders under the Credit Agreement, the lenders under the credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit under such facilities. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the credit facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness. We have pledged a significant portion of our assets as collateral under the Credit Agreement. If the lenders under the credit facilities accelerate the repayment of borrowings, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings, as well as our unsecured indebtedness.\nRisks Related to the Separation\nWe have no history of operating as an independent company, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company and may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical information about Vestis in this 10-K refers to Vestis as operated by and integrated with Aramark. The historical financial information of Vestis included in this 10-K is derived from the Combined Financial Statements and accounting records of Aramark. Accordingly, the historical financial information included in this 10-K does not necessarily reflect the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows that we would have achieved as a separate, publicly traded company during the periods presented or those that we will achieve in the future primarily as a result of the factors described below:\nGenerally, our working capital requirements and capital for our general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and acquisitions, have historically been satisfied as part of the corporate-wide cash management\npolicies of Aramark. Following the completion of the Separation, our results of operations and cash flows may be more volatile, and we may need to obtain additional financing from banks, through public offerings or private placements of debt or equity securities, strategic relationships or other arrangements, which may or may not be available and may be more costly.\nPrior to the Separation, our business was operated by Aramark as part of its broader corporate organization, rather than as an independent company. Aramark or one of its affiliates performed various corporate functions for us, such as legal, treasury, accounting, auditing, human resources, information technology, investor relations and finance. Our historical and financial results reflect allocations of corporate expenses from Aramark for such functions, which are likely to be less than the expenses we would have incurred had we operated as a separate publicly traded company.\nHistorically, our business was integrated with the other businesses of Aramark and our business shared economies of scope and scale in costs, employees, vendor relationships and customer relationships. While Aramark has sought to minimize the impact on us when separating these arrangements, there is no guarantee these arrangements will continue to capture these benefits in the future.\nAfter the Separation, the cost of capital for our business may be higher than Aramarks cost of capital prior to the Separation.\nAs an independent public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and are required to prepare standalone financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. These reporting and other obligations will place significant demands on our management and administrative and operational resources. Moreover, to comply with these requirements, we anticipate that we will need to migrate our systems, including information technology systems, implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures, and hire additional accounting, finance, and information technology staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses related to these steps, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired.\nFollowing the separation, our financial profile has changed, and we are a smaller, less diversified company than Aramark prior to the Separation.\nThe Separation resulted in us being a smaller, less diversified company than Aramark. As a result, we may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the diversification of our revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish as a standalone company, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and our ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and service debt may be diminished. Following the Separation, we may also lose capital allocation efficiency and flexibility, as we no longer have access to cash flow from Aramark to fund our business.\nWe may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the Separation.\nWe may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected to result from the Separation, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. The Separation is expected to provide the following benefits, among others: (1) permitting us to more effectively pursue the distinct operating priorities and strategies of our respective businesses; (2) permitting us to allocate financial resources to meet the unique needs of our own business, which will allow us to intensify our focus on our distinct strategic priorities and to more effectively pursue our own distinct capital structures and capital allocation strategies; (3) allowing us to more effectively articulate a clear investment thesis to attract a long-term investor base suited to our business and facilitate our access to capital by providing investors with a distinct and targeted investment opportunity; (4) creating an independent equity security for Vestis, affording us direct access to the capital markets and enabling us to use our own industry-focused stock to consummate future acquisitions or other transactions; and (5) permitting us to more effectively recruit, retain and motivate employees through the use of stock-based compensation that more closely reflects and aligns management and employee incentives with specific growth\nobjectives, financial goals and business performance and allows incentive structures and targets to be better aligned with our business.\nWe may not achieve these and other anticipated benefits for a variety of reasons, including, among others: (1) the Separation will demand significant management resources and require significant amounts of managements time and effort, which may divert managements attention from operating and growing our business; (2) following the Separation, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than if we were still a part of Aramark because our business will be less diversified than Aramarks businesses prior to the completion of the Separation; (3) after the Separation, as a standalone company, we may be unable to obtain certain goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable as those Aramark obtained prior to completion of the Separation; (4) the Separation may require us to pay costs that could be substantial and material to our financial resources, including accounting, tax, legal and other professional services costs, recruiting and relocation costs associated with hiring key senior management and personnel new to us, tax costs and costs to separate information systems; and (5) under the terms of the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Aramark, we will be restricted from taking certain actions that could cause the Separation or certain related transactions to fail to qualify as tax-free to Aramark and Aramark stockholders, or could result in certain other taxes to Aramark, and these restrictions may limit us for a period of time from pursuing certain strategic transactions and equity issuances or engaging in other transactions that might increase the value of our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Separation, or if such benefits are delayed, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are unable to replace the services that Aramark currently provides to us under the transition services agreement on terms that are at least as favorable to us as the terms on which Aramark is providing such services, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe will engage in the process of creating our own, or engaging third parties separate from Aramark to provide, systems and services to replace many of the systems and services that Aramark currently provides to us under the transition services agreement, including, for example, information technology infrastructure and systems and accounting and reporting systems. We may incur temporary interruptions in business operations if we cannot transition effectively from Aramarks existing operating systems, databases and programming languages that support these functions to our own systems. The failure to implement the new systems and transition data successfully and cost-effectively could disrupt our business operations and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, our costs for the operation of these systems may be higher than the amounts reflected in our historical Combined Financial Statements.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject as a standalone publicly traded company following the Separation.\nOur financial results previously were included within the consolidated results of Aramark. We were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. As a result of the Separation, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act, including the requirements of Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. These reporting and other obligations place significant demands on our management and administrative and operational resources, including accounting resources.\nMoreover, in connection with our compliance with these requirements, we are migrating our systems, including information technology systems, implementing additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and hiring additional accounting and finance staff. We are incurring additional annual expenses related to these steps, and these expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are repositioning our brand to remove the Aramark name, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain customers.\nWe have historically marketed our products and services using the Aramark name and logo, which is a globally recognized brand with a strong reputation for high-quality products and services. Following the Separation, subject to limited exceptions, we are repositioning our brand and update, as applicable, our products and services using the Vestis name or other names and marks and removing the Aramark name and logo on our products and discontinuing its use in connection with our service offerings. These new names and brands may not benefit from the same recognition and association with product quality as the Aramark name, which could adversely affect our ability to attract and maintain our customers, who may prefer to use products with a more established brand identity.\nWe may be affected by restrictions under the tax matters agreement, including on our ability to engage in certain corporate transactions for a two-year period after the Separation, in order to avoid triggering significant tax-related liabilities.\nUnder current U.S. federal income tax law, a spin-off that otherwise qualifies for tax-free treatment can be rendered taxable to the parent corporation and its stockholders as a result of certain post-spin-off transactions, including certain acquisitions of shares or assets of the spun-off corporation. Under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Aramark, we are restricted from taking certain actions that could prevent the Separation and certain related transactions from being tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In particular, under the tax matters agreement, for the two-year period following the Separation we are subject to specific restrictions on our ability to pursue or enter into acquisition, merger, sale and redemption transactions with respect to our stock. These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business. In addition, under the tax matters agreement, we may be required to indemnify Aramark and its affiliates against any tax-related liabilities incurred by them as a result of the acquisition of our stock or assets, even if we do not participate in or otherwise facilitate the acquisition. Furthermore, we are subject to specific restrictions on discontinuing the active conduct of our trade or business, the issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our stock but excluding certain compensatory arrangements), and sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business. Such restrictions may reduce our strategic and operating flexibility.\nWe may be held liable to Aramark if we fail to perform under our agreements with Aramark which may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company and Aramark entered into various agreements, including a separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and other transaction agreements. If we do not satisfactorily perform our obligations under these agreements, we may be held liable for any resulting losses suffered by Aramark, subject to certain limits.\nOur agreements with Aramark may be on terms that are less beneficial to us than the terms may have otherwise been from unaffiliated third parties.\nThe agreements that we entered into with Aramark in connection with the Separation include the separation and distribution agreement, a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement and other transaction agreements. These agreements were prepared in the context of the Separation while we were still a wholly owned subsidiary of Aramark. Accordingly, during the period in which the terms of those agreements were prepared, we did not have an independent Board of Directors or a management team that was independent of Aramark. As a result, the terms of those agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arms-length negotiations between unaffiliated third parties.\nIf there is a determination that the Separation or certain related transactions are taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we could incur significant liabilities pursuant to our indemnification obligations under the tax matters agreement.\nAramark received a private letter ruling from the IRS and opinions of its outside tax advisors, in each case, satisfactory to the Aramark Board of Directors, regarding certain U.S. federal income tax matters relating to the Separation. The opinion of its outside tax advisors was based upon and relied on, among other things, various facts and assumptions, as well as certain representations, statements and undertakings of Aramark and us, including facts, assumptions, representations, statements and undertakings relating to the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses\nand other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations and statements were or become inaccurate or incomplete, or if any such undertaking is not complied with, Aramark may not be able to rely on the opinions of its outside tax advisors, and the conclusions reached therein could be jeopardized.\nNotwithstanding Aramarks receipt of the opinions of its outside tax advisors, the IRS could determine on audit that the Separation or certain related transactions are taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations, statements and undertakings upon which the opinions were based are incorrect or have been violated, or if it disagrees with any of the conclusions in the opinions. Accordingly, notwithstanding Aramarks receipt of the opinions of its outside tax advisors, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert that the Separation or certain related transactions do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In the event the IRS were to prevail in such a challenge, Aramark and Aramarks stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Under the tax matters agreement that we entered into with Aramark, we generally will be required to indemnify Aramark for any taxes incurred by Aramark that arise as a result of (i) any representations made by us being inaccurate; (ii) an acquisition of our stock or assets or (iii) any other action undertaken or failure to act by us. Any such indemnification could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nSatisfaction of indemnification obligations following the Separation could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPursuant to the separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements we entered into with Aramark in connection with the Separation, Aramark agrees to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we agree to indemnify Aramark for certain liabilities. Indemnities that we will be required to provide Aramark could negatively affect our business.\nThe indemnity from Aramark may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities if, for example, Aramark is not able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Aramark any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourself, requiring us to divert cash that would otherwise have been used in furtherance of our operating business. In addition, third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Aramark has agreed to retain. Each of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere can be no assurance that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nFrom time to time we may need to access the long-term and short-term capital markets to obtain financing. Although we believe that the sources of capital in place at the time of the separation will permit us to finance our operations for the foreseeable future on acceptable terms and conditions, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including, but not limited to: (1) our financial performance; (2) our credit ratings or absence of a credit rating; (3) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (4) the state of the economy. There can be no assurance, particularly as a new company, that we will have access to the capital markets on terms acceptable to us.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we do not enjoy the same benefits that we did as a part of Aramark.\nAs a result of the Separation, we are more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been if we were still a part of the Aramark organizational structure. As part of Aramark, we were able to enjoy certain benefits from Aramarks operating diversity, size, purchasing power, cost of capital, and opportunities to pursue integrated strategies with Aramarks other businesses. As an independent, publicly traded company, we do not have the same benefits. Additionally, as part of Aramark, we were able to leverage Aramarks historical reputation, performance and brand identity to recruit and retain key personnel to run and operate our business. As an independent, publicly traded company, we will need to develop new strategies, and it may be more difficult for us to recruit or retain such key personnel.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nYour percentage of ownership in Vestis may be diluted in the future.\nIn the future, your percentage ownership in Vestis may be diluted because of equity issuances for acquisitions, capital market transactions or otherwise, including any equity awards that we will grant to our directors, officers and employees. Our employees have stock-based awards that correspond to shares of our common stock after the Separation as a result of conversion of their Aramark stock-based awards and have been issued new Vestis stock awards. Such awards will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. From time to time, we will issue additional stock-based awards to our employees under our employee benefits plans.\nWe cannot guarantee the timing, declaration, amount or payment of dividends on our common stock.\nAfter the Separation, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per common share payable on January 4, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2023. However, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will continue to be within the discretion of our Board of Directors, and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. The aggregate amount of dividends paid by us and Aramark may differ from historical dividends paid by Aramark due to, among other matters, changes in the level of cash generated by our operations and changes in our capital needs. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nAnti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain, and Delaware law contains, provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids too expensive to the bidder and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover. These provisions are, among others:\nuntil the third annual stockholder meeting following the Separation, our Board of Directors will be divided into three classes, with each class consisting, as nearly as may be possible, of one-third of the total number of directors, which could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult;\nas long as the Board of Directors is classified, our directors can be removed by stockholders only for cause\nvacancies occurring on the Board of Directors can only be filled by a majority of the remaining members of our Board of Directors or by a sole remaining director;\nfor two years following the Separation, stockholders do not have the right to call a special meeting;\nstockholders do not have the ability to act by written consent;\nour Board of Directors has the power to designate and issue, without any further vote or action by the our stockholders, shares of preferred stock from time to time in one or more series; and\nstockholders have to follow certain procedures and notice requirements in order to present certain proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that you may favor. Section 203 provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with persons that acquire, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation may not engage in a business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares, for a three-year period following the date on which that person or any of its affiliates becomes the holder of more than 15% of the corporations outstanding voting stock.\nWe believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our Board of Directors and by providing the Board with more time to assess any acquisition proposal. These provisions are not intended to make us immune from takeovers; however, these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our Board of Directors determines is not in the best interests of Vestis and its stockholders. These provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. In addition, an acquisition or further issuance of our common stock could trigger the application of Section 355(e) of the Code, causing the Separation to be taxable to Aramark. Under the tax matters agreement, we are required to indemnify Aramark for the resulting tax, and this indemnity obligation might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designate the state courts within the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by Vestis stockholders, which could discourage lawsuits against Vestis and our directors and officers.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we (through approval of our Board of Directors) consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action brought on behalf of Vestis, (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director or officer or other employee of Vestis to Vestis or Vestiss stockholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against Vestis or any director or officer or other employee of Vestis arising pursuant to, or seeking to enforce any right, obligation or remedy under, any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the DGCL) or Vestiss amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws (as either may be amended from time to time), (4) any action asserting a claim against Vestis or any director or officer or other employee of Vestis governed by the internal affairs doctrine, which is a conflict of laws principle which recognizes that only one state should have the authority to regulate a corporations internal affairs or (5) any action as to which the DGCL (as it may be amended from time to time) confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. If and only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware dismisses any such action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such action may be brought in another state court sitting in the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware). This exclusive forum provision applies to all covered actions, including any covered action in which the plaintiff chooses to assert a claim or claims under federal law in addition to a claim or claims under Delaware law. However, the exclusive forum provision does not apply to actions asserting only federal law claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, regardless of whether the state courts in the State of Delaware have jurisdiction over those claims. Although we believe the exclusive forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with Vestis or its directors or officers, and it may be costlier for our stockholders to bring a claim in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware than other judicial forums, each of which may discourage such lawsuits against Vestis and its directors and officers.\nAlthough our amended and restated certificate of incorporation includes this exclusive forum provision, it is possible that a court could rule that this provision is inapplicable or unenforceable. Alternatively, if a court were to find this exclusive forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings described above, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.\nNone. Item 2. Properties.\nOur principal executive offices are currently leased at 500 Colonial Center Parkway, Suite 140, Roswell, GA 30076. As of September 29, 2023, we operated 367 sites including laundry plants, satellite plants, distribution centers and manufacturing plants that are located across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. We own 191 buildings, including distribution centers and satellite plants. We own 162 buildings in the United States and 29 buildings in Canada. We lease 176 premises, consisting of offices, laundry plants, satellite plants, manufacturing plants, and distribution centers. We lease 163 premises in the United States and 13 premises in Canada. No individual parcel of real estate owned or leased is of material significance to our total assets. Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nOn May 13, 2022, Cake Love Co. (Cake Love) commenced a putative class action lawsuit against AmeriPride Services, LLC (AmeriPride), a subsidiary of Vestis, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit was subsequently updated to add an additional named plaintiff, Q-Mark Manufacturing, Inc. (Q-Mark and, together with Cake Love, the Plaintiffs). Plaintiffs allege that the defendants increased certain pricing charged to members of the purported class without the proper notice required by service agreements between AmeriPride and members of the purported class and that AmeriPride breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of the purported class representing the amount of the allegedly improperly noticed price increases along with attorneys fees, interest and costs. The parties continue to engage in discovery. AmeriPride has moved for summary judgment related to Cake Love. We believe we have numerous defenses and intend to continue to vigorously defend the action. We cannot predict the outcome of this legal matter, nor can we predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on our combined statements of income and/or combined statements of cash flows. Accordingly, we have made no provisions for this legal matter in our combined financial statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nShares of our common stock began regular-way trading on October 2, 2023 and are quoted on the NYSE under the ticker symbol VSTS. Prior to October 2, 2023 there was no public market for our common stock. As of November 30, 2023, there were approximately 798 holders of record of our outstanding common stock. This does not include persons who hold our common stock in nominee or street name accounts through brokers or banks. From October 2, 2023 through November 30, 2023, the highest sales price for our common stock on the NYSE was $19.31 per share, and the lowest sales price for our common stock on the NYSE was $13.83 per share.\nDividends\nAfter the Separation, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.035 per common share payable on January 4, 2024 to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 15, 2023. However, the timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends will continue to be within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries, covenants associated with certain of our debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice, ability to access capital markets and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nAs of September 29, 2023, we did not maintain an equity compensation plan and none of our securities were available for issuance under an equity compensation plan. While the Board of Directors adopted the Vestis Corporation 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan in connection with the Spin-Off, no awards under it were outstanding as of September 29, 2023. Accordingly, no equity compensation plan information table is provided. Item 6. [ Reserved ]. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of Vestis Corporations (Vestis, the Company, our, we or us) financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 should be read in conjunction with our audited Combined Financial Statements and the notes to those statements. For additional information on the year ended October 1, 2021 and year-over-year comparisons to September 30, 2022, refer to \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our Form 10-12B/A filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on September 6, 2023.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements, such as our plans, objectives, opinions, expectations, anticipations, intentions, and beliefs, that are based upon our current expectations but that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in those forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors, Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report).\nAll amounts discussed are in thousands of U.S. dollars, except where otherwise indicated.\nCompany Overview\nWe are a leading provider of uniforms and workplace supplies across the United States and Canada, with over 75 years of experience in the workplace apparel and supplies industry. We provide a full range of uniform programs, managed restroom supply services, first aid supplies and safety products, as well as ancillary items such as floor mats, towels, and linens, to more than 300,000 customer locations across the United States and Canada. We compete with national, regional, and local providers who vary in size, scale, capabilities and product and service offering. Primary methods of competition include product quality, service quality and price. Notable competitors of size include Cintas Corporation and UniFirst Corporation, as well as numerous regional and local competitors. Additionally, many businesses\nperform certain aspects of our product and service offerings in-house rather than outsourcing them and leveraging the benefits of full-service programs.\nWith approximately 20,000 employees, we operate a network of over 350 facilities including laundry plants, satellite plants, distribution centers and manufacturing plants along with a fleet of service vehicles that support over 3,400 pick-up and delivery routes. We have two manufacturing facilities in Mexico with approximately 189,000 square feet of manufacturing capacity between both plants that produce approximately 50% of our uniforms and linens products. We source raw materials, finished goods, equipment, and other supplies from a variety of domestic and international suppliers. We leverage our broad footprint, supply chain, delivery fleet and route logistics capabilities to serve customers on a recurring basis, typically weekly, and primarily through multi-year contracts.\nOur full-service uniform offering (Uniforms) includes the design, sourcing, manufacturing, customization, personalization, delivery, laundering, sanitization, repair, and replacement of uniforms. Our uniform options include shirts, pants, outerwear, gowns, scrubs, high visibility garments, particulate-free garments, and flame-resistant garments, along with shoes and accessories. We service our customers on a recurring rental basis, typically weekly, delivering clean uniforms while, during the same visit, picking up worn uniforms for inspection, cleaning and repair or replacement. In addition to our weekly, recurring customer contracts, we offer customized uniforms through direct sales agreements, typically for large, regional, or national companies.\nIn addition to Uniforms, we also provide workplace supplies (Workplace Supplies) including managed restroom supply services, first aid supplies and safety products, floor mats, towels, and linens. Similar to our uniform offering, on a recurring rental basis, generally weekly, we pick up used and soiled floor mats, towels and linens, replacing them with clean products. We also restock restroom supplies, first aid supplies and safety products as needed.\nWe manage and operate our business in two reportable segments, United States and Canada. Both segments provide Uniforms and Workplace Supplies, as described above, to customers within their specific geographic territories.\nSeparation from and Relationship with Aramark\nOn September 30, 2023 (the \"Distribution Date\"), Aramark completed the previously announced spin-off of Vestis (the \"Spin-Off,\" or the Separation). The Separation was completed through a distribution of our outstanding common stock to stockholders of record of Aramarks common stock as of the close of business on September 20, 2023. Aramark stockholders of record received one share of Vestis common stock for every two shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of Aramark.\nFollowing the separation, certain functions that Aramark provided to us prior to the separation will continue to be provided to us by Aramark under a transition services agreement.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Combined Financial Statements reflect the combined historical results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 and the financial position as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 for Vestis. The Combined Financial Statements have been derived from Aramarks historical accounting records and were prepared on a standalone basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. The assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses of Vestis have been reflected in these Combined Financial Statements on a historical cost basis, as included in the Combined Financial Statements of Aramark, using the historical accounting policies applied by Aramark. Historically, separate financial statements have not been prepared for Vestis and it has not operated as a standalone business from Aramark. The historical results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Vestis presented in these Combined Financial Statements may not be indicative of what they would have been had we been an independent standalone public company, nor are they necessarily indicative of our future results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nOur business has historically functioned together with other Aramark businesses. Accordingly, we relied on certain of Aramarks corporate support functions to operate. The Combined Financial Statements include all revenues and costs directly attributable to us and an allocation of expenses related to certain Aramark corporate functions. These expenses have been allocated to us on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount or other drivers. We consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the\nutilization of services or the benefit received. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had we operated as an independent, standalone public entity, nor are they indicative of our future expenses.\nThe Combined Financial Statements include assets and liabilities that have been determined to be specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to us.\nOur cash flows within the United States segment are transferred to Aramark regularly as part of Aramarks centralized cash management program. Our cash flows within the Canada segment are reinvested locally. The cash and cash equivalents held by Aramark at the corporate level are not specifically identifiable to us and therefore were not allocated to any of the periods presented. Only cash amounts specifically attributable to us are reflected in the Combined Balance Sheets. Transfers of cash, both to and from Aramarks central cash management system, are reflected as a component of Net parent investment on the Combined Balance Sheets and in Net cash used in financing activities on the accompanying Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\nAramarks long-term borrowings and related interest expense, exclusive of certain financing lease obligations, have not been attributed to us for any of the periods presented because the borrowings are neither directly attributable to us nor are we the primary legal obligor of such borrowings. However, as of September 29, 2023, we incurred indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of $1,500 million, which have been included in the Combined Financial Statements (see Note 4. Borrowings to our Combined Financial Statements).\nAll intercompany transactions and balances within Vestis have been eliminated. Transactions between us and Aramark have been included in these Combined Financial Statements and are considered related party transactions (see Note 5. Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investments to our Combined Financial Statements).\nThe Provision for Income Taxes in the Combined Statements of Income has been calculated as if we filed a separate tax return and were operating as a standalone company. Therefore, income tax expense, cash tax payments and items of current and deferred income taxes may not be reflective of our actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the distribution.\nSources of Revenue\nWe generate and recognize over 93% of our total revenue from route servicing contracts on both Uniforms, which we generally manufacture, and Workplace Supplies, such as mats, towels, and linens that are procured from third-party suppliers. Revenue from these contracts represent a single-performance obligation and are recognized over time as services are performed based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method). We generate the remaining revenue primarily from the direct sale of uniforms to customers, with such revenue being recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied, typically upon the transfer of control of the promised product to the customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the services or products described above and is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCosts and Expenses\nOur costs and expenses are comprised of cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (hereafter referred to as cost of services provided), depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCost of services provided includes the costs associated with the recurring pickup, processing and delivery of products to rental customers, the amortized cost of merchandise in service for the rental business, and the cost of products sold to customers through our direct sales offerings.\nDepreciation and amortization expense reflects the cost of investments in our manufacturing plants, processing facilities, distribution centers and technology capabilities, and the amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions. More specifically, depreciation expense is related to processing operation assets such as washers, dryers, steam tunnels and related equipment, distribution centers and related product handling and storage equipment, company-owned and financed delivery vehicles, information technologies and other assets for which we expect to receive an economic benefit for greater than one year. The cost of these investments is depreciated on a straight-line basis over three to 40 years based upon the estimated useful life of the asset.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include costs attributable to our sales team and the administrative functions required to support our customers and our team members.\nInterest Expense and Other, net, is primarily comprised of interest expense recognized on financing leases, our share of the financial results for equity method investments and interest expense incurred under our Credit Agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Provision for Income Taxes represents federal, foreign, state, and local income taxes. Our effective tax rate differs from the statutory United States income tax rate due to the effect of state and local income taxes, the tax rate in Canada where we have operations, nontaxable gain on the sale of our equity investment in Sanikleen, a Japanese linen supply company, tax credits and certain nondeductible expenses.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nThe impact from foreign currency translation assumes constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the prior fiscal year period being used in translation for the comparable current year period. We believe that providing the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates on certain financial results can facilitate analysis of period-to-period comparisons of business performance.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period which ends on the Friday nearest to September 30th. The fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 were each 52-week periods.\nKey Trends Affecting Our Results of Operations\nWe serve the uniforms, mats, towels, linens, restroom supplies, first-aid supplies and safety products industry within the United States and Canada. This includes businesses that outsource these services through rental programs or direct purchases, as well as non-programmers, or businesses that maintain these services in-house. We believe that demand in this industry is largely influenced by macro-economic conditions, employment levels, increasing standards for workplace hygiene and safety and an ongoing trend of businesses outsourcing non-core, back-end operations. As a result of the diversity of our customers and the wide variety of industries in which they participate, demand for our products and services is not specifically linked to the cyclical nature of any one sector.\nRecent global events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. COVID-19 related disruptions negatively impacted our financial and operating results beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 through the first half of fiscal 2021. Our financial results started to improve during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continued to improve throughout fiscal 2022 as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, and operations reopened.\nIn addition, the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the recent Israel-Hamas War, regions in which we do not have direct operations, further disrupted global supply chains and heightened volatility and disruption of global financial markets. The ongoing volatility and disruption of financial markets caused by these global events, as well as other current global economic factors, triggered inflation in labor and energy costs and has driven significant changes in foreign currencies. The impact on our longer-term operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including our response and governmental response to inflation, the duration and severity of the ongoing volatility and disruption of global financial markets and our ability to effectively hire and retain personnel. Some of these future developments are outside of our control and are highly uncertain.\nWe continue to remain principally focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and everyone we serve, while simultaneously taking timely, proactive measures to adapt to the current environment. Throughout fiscal 2022, we saw continued improved profitability from customers reopening as COVID-19 restrictions eased as well as from effective management of operating costs and pricing including temporary fees to mitigate the effects of elevated inflation. We continue to evaluate and react to the effects of a prolonged global disruption, including items such as inflationary pressures on product and energy costs and greater labor challenges. These challenges have continued to impact our business during fiscal 2023. Our actions to mitigate the effects of inflation in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023 included operating cost reductions, reductions in discretionary spending and reductions in our non-operational footprint,\nalong with the implementation of targeted and strategic price increases under the terms of our customer contracts. We do not know whether we will be able to mitigate any future impacts of inflation with further increases in pricing for our goods and services. We continue to evaluate and react to take appropriate actions to mitigate the risk in these areas. See Risk Factors-Operational Risks-Unfavorable economic conditions have in the past adversely affected, are currently affecting and in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nThe following table presents an overview of our results on a combined basis with the amount of and percentage change between periods for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands).\nFiscal Year Ended Change Change\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 $ %\nRevenue $ 2,825,286 $ 2,687,005 $ 138,281 5.1 %\nOperating Expenses:\nCost of services provided(1)\n1,970,215 1,909,676 60,539 3.2 %\nDepreciation and amortization 136,504 134,352 2,152 1.6 %\nSelling, general and administrative expenses 500,658 450,734 49,924 11.1 %\nTotal Operating Expenses 2,607,377 2,494,762 112,615 4.5 %\nOperating Income 217,909 192,243 25,666 13.4 %\nGain on Sale of Equity Investment, net (51,831) - (51,831) (100.0 %)\nInterest Expense and Other, net 10 2,284 (2,274) (99.6 %)\nIncome Before Income Taxes 269,730 189,959 79,771 42.0 %\nProvision for Income Taxes 56,572 48,280 8,292 17.2 %\nNet Income $ 213,158 $ 141,679 $ 71,479 50.5 %\n______________________\n(1)Exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nConsolidated revenue of $2,825.3 million increased 5.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by sales volume growth and pricing actions, partially offset by the approximately $14.5 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates between years. Sales volume growth contributed approximately $77.7 million to the increase. Pricing accounted for the remainder of the increase, including actions taken to offset the impact of inflationary pressures and increased merchandise amortization on sales growth. This includes the impact of a temporary energy fee implemented late in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The revenue from the temporary energy fee was $26 million in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.\nCost of services provided increased 3.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to approximately $31.1 million of incremental amortization of rental merchandise in service assets and due to roughly $30.8 million of higher labor and energy costs from the continuation of inflationary pressures.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased 11.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase was primarily attributable to non-cash charges for the impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets and other costs ($7.7 million), incremental personnel and other expenses related to Aramarks intention to spin off its Uniforms segment ($27.1 million), severance charges ($7.6 million), incremental charges for bad debt ($9.3 million), and incremental personnel costs related to merit and inflation ($5.0 million), partially offset by a gain on the sale of land ($6.8 million) recorded in fiscal 2023 and savings from severance actions in fiscal 2023 ($3.3 million).\nOperating income of $217.9 million increased 13.4% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year driven by the growth in revenue offset by higher costs of services provided and selling, general and administrative expenses as noted above.\nOperating income as a percentage of revenue (operating income margin) increased from 7.2% in fiscal 2022 to 7.7% in fiscal 2023, an improvement of approximately 50 basis points.\nGain on Sale of Equity Investments, net increased $51.8 million in fiscal 2023 from the prior fiscal year. The increase was driven by the sale of our equity investment in Sanikleen, a Japanese linen supply company, for approximately $51.9 million.\nInterest Expense and Other, net, decreased $2.3 million in fiscal 2023 from the prior fiscal year.\nThe provision for income taxes for fiscal 2023 was recorded at an effective rate of 21.0% compared to an effective rate of 25.4% in fiscal 2022. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a nontaxable gain on the sale of our equity investment in Sanikleen in fiscal 2023.\nNet income of $213.2 million in fiscal 2023 represented an increase of $71.5 million, or 50.5% compared to the prior fiscal year.\nResults of Operations-United States Results\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nThe following table presents an overview of our United States reportable segment results with the amount of and percentage change between periods for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands).\nFiscal Year Ended Change Change\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 $ %\nRevenue $ 2,575,352 $ 2,447,027 $ 128,325 5.2 %\nSegment Operating Income 303,762 242,971 60,791 25.0 %\nSegment Operating Income % 11.8 % 9.9 %\nUnited States revenue increased 5.2% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was driven by sales volume growth and pricing actions. Sales volume growth in the U.S. contributed approximately $64.4 million to the increase. Pricing in the U.S. accounted for the remainder of the increase, including actions taken to offset the impact of inflationary pressures and increased merchandise amortization on sales growth. This includes the impact of a temporary energy fee implemented late in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, continuing through the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The revenue from the temporary energy fee was $26 million in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. Uniforms revenue for fiscal 2023 of approximately $1,068 million was essentially flat relative to fiscal 2022. Workplace Supplies revenue for fiscal 2023 of approximately $1,508 million increased roughly $128 million, or 9.3%, relative to fiscal 2022.\nSegment operating income of $303.8 million in fiscal 2023 increased 25.0% compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by:\nan approximate $118.8 million increase in operating income from the higher year-over-year revenue during fiscal 2023 relative to the prior fiscal year;\nan approximate $14.0 million in savings from permanent cost reduction actions taken earlier in fiscal year 2023; and\na $6.8 million gain on the sale of real estate property during fiscal 2023; partially offset by:\nincremental labor and energy costs of approximately $47.2 million linked to a significant inflationary environment;\nan approximate $27.1 million increase in rental merchandise amortization associated with incremental investments made in rental merchandise to support sales growth as we exited the COVID-19 pandemic;\nseverance costs of $7.6 million during fiscal 2023.\nSegment operating income margin improved approximately 190 basis points from 9.9% in fiscal 2022 to approximately 11.8% in fiscal 2023.\nResults of Operations-Canada Results\nFiscal 2023 Compared to Fiscal 2022\nThe following table presents an overview of our Canada reportable segment results with the amount of and percentage change between periods for the fiscal years 2023 and 2022 (dollars in thousands).\nFiscal Year Ended Change Change\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 $ %\nRevenue $ 249,934 $ 239,978 $ 9,956 4.1 %\nSegment Operating Income 13,707 18,008 (4,301) (23.9) %\nSegment Operating Income % 5.5 % 7.5 %\nCanada revenue increased 4.1% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year was driven by sales volume growth and pricing, offset by an approximate $14.4 million negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates between years. Uniforms revenue for fiscal 2023 of approximately $100 million was essentially flat relative to fiscal 2022. Workplace Supplies revenue for fiscal 2023 of approximately $150 million increased roughly $11 million, or 7.6%, relative to fiscal 2022.\nSegment operating income of 13.7 million decreased 23.9% in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily driven by:\nincremental labor and energy costs of approximately $7.2 million linked to a significant inflationary environment; and\nan approximate $4.2 million increase in rental merchandise amortization associated with incremental investments made in rental merchandise to support sales growth as we exited the COVID-19 pandemic; partially offset by:\nan approximate $7.2 million increase in operating income from the higher year-over-year revenue during fiscal 2023 relative to the prior fiscal year.\nSegment operating income margin decreased approximately 200 basis points from 7.5% in fiscal 2022 to 5.5% in fiscal 2023.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nHistorically, our business generated positive cash flows from operations. Cash flows within our United States operations were transferred to Aramark regularly as part of Aramarks centralized cash management program. This arrangement was used to manage liquidity of Aramark and fund the operations of our business as needed. This arrangement is not indicative of how we would have funded our operations had we been a standalone company separate from Aramark during the periods presented. Cash transferred to and from Aramarks cash management accounts are reflected within net parent investment as a component of Aramarks equity.\nThe cash and cash equivalents held by Aramark at the corporate level were not specifically identifiable to us and therefore were not allocated to any of the periods presented. The majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is from our Canadian operations. Third-party debt and the related interest expense of Aramark has not been allocated to us for any of the periods presented because Aramarks borrowings were not directly attributable to our standalone business.\nOn September 29, 2023, we entered into a senior secured financing in an aggregate amount of $1,800 million, consisting of the Term Loan Facilities and the Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan Facilities consist of a United States dollar denominated term loan A-1 tranche in the amount of $800 million (the \"Term Loan A-1), and a United States dollar denominated term loan A-2 tranche in the amount of $700 million (the \"Term Loan A-2\" and, together with the Term Loan A-1, the Term Loan Facilities). The Term Loan A-2 includes $8.75M of principal payments each quarter until the maturity date, in which the remaining unpaid principal amount is due. Additionally, the Revolving Credit Facility is available for loans in United States dollars and Canadian dollars with aggregate commitments of $300 million (the Revolving Credit Facility and, together with the Term Loan Facilities, the Credit Facilities).\nThe Term Loan A-1 will mature on September 29, 2025 (the Term A-1 Maturity Date) and the Term Loan A-2 will mature on the earlier of (i) September 29, 2028 and (ii) the date (the Springing Maturity Date) that is 4 months prior to the Term A-1 Maturity Date if any portion of the Term Loan A-1 (or indebtedness which extends, renews, refunds or replaces any portion of the Term Loan A-1) remains outstanding as of such date and has, as of such date, a scheduled maturity date prior to September 29, 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earliest of (i) September 29, 2028, (ii) the Springing Maturity Date, and (iii) the date of termination of all of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or the date on which the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility become due and payable or the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are terminated. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities will bear interest at rates calculated by reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or the Base Rate (as defined in the definitive credit agreement entered into with respect to the Credit Facilities (the Credit Agreement)), at the option of the Company, plus a margin, which initially will be 2.25% for SOFR loans and 1.25% for Base Rate loans and thereafter will fluctuate based on the Companys total net leverage ratio.\nThe Companys obligations under the Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the Companys existing and future wholly owned domestic material subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions. Borrowings under the Credit Facilities are secured by first priority liens on substantially all the assets of the Company and the guarantors, subject to certain customary exceptions.\nOn September 29, 2023, concurrent with consummation of the Separation, we made a cash distribution of approximately $1,457 million to Aramark.\nAs of September 29, 2023, we had approximately $36 million of cash and cash equivalents and $300 million of availability for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facility.\nThe table below summarizes our cash activity (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 256,977 $ 232,847\nNet cash used in investing activities (14,746) (86,133)\nNet cash used in financing activities (230,269) (162,543)\nReference to the audited Combined Statements of Cash Flows will facilitate understanding of the discussion that follows.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $257.0 million during fiscal 2023 and $232.8 million during fiscal 2022, respectively. The change was driven by net income in fiscal 2023 of $213.2 million compared to net income in fiscal 2022 of $141.7 million, as discussed in \"Results of Operations\" above, and unfavorable non-cash adjustments to net income between fiscal years of $77.3 million, which were primarily driven by a $26.1 million inventory charge in fiscal 2022 that did not recur in fiscal 2023 and due to a $51.8 million gain on sale of an equity investment in fiscal 2023. The change in net income inclusive of non-cash adjustments was offset by the change in cash from operating assets and liabilities of $30.0 million, which was primarily due to:\nIncrease in operating cash flows during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to the lower use of cash for rental merchandise in-service of $36.9 million as the result of the prior year period operations returning following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions;\nIncrease in operating cash flows during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to the lower use of cash from accounts receivables of $30.2 million as the prior year period had a higher use of cash from operations returning following the lifting of COVID-19 restrictions. Both periods were impacted by base and new business growth and timing of collections;\nIncrease in operating cash flows during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to a greater source of cash from accrued expenses of $23.5 million primarily due to growth in business operations, higher severance charges recorded in fiscal 2023 and timing of other payments; partially offset by:\nDecrease in operating cash flows during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to a lower source of cash from accounts payable of $64.3 million primarily due to the timing of disbursements.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $14.7 million during fiscal 2023 was $71.4 million lower during fiscal 2023 relative to fiscal 2022 primarily due to cash proceeds of $51.9 million related to the sale of our Sanikleen equity investment and due to the prior year use of $17.2 million of cash to fund the acquisition of certain businesses.\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nDuring fiscal 2023, cash provided by financing activities was impacted by the following:\ncash receipts related to newly issued debt of ($1,500.0 million);\ncash transferred to Aramark ($1,688.9 million);\npayments related to finance leases ($27.6 million); and\npayments related to debt issuance costs ($13.7 million).\nDuring fiscal 2022, cash used in financing activities was impacted by the following:\ncash transferred to Aramark ($134.5 million); and\npayments related to finance leases ($28.0 million).\nCovenant Compliance\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to: incur additional indebtedness; issue preferred stock or provide guarantees; create liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations; sell or dispose of assets; pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase its capital stock; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make investments, loans or advances; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to the Company from its restricted subsidiaries; amend material agreements governing our subordinated debt; repay or repurchase any subordinated debt, except as scheduled or at maturity; make certain acquisitions; change our fiscal year; and fundamentally change our business. The Credit Agreement contains certain customary affirmative covenants. The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default and other provisions that could require all amounts due thereunder to become immediately due and payable at the option of the lenders, if we fail to comply with the terms of the Credit Agreement or if other customary events occur.\nThe Credit Agreement requires us to maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness over unrestricted cash divided by Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, not to exceed 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2025, and not to exceed 4.50x for any fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2025, subject to certain exceptions. Consolidated total indebtedness is defined in the Credit Agreement as total indebtedness consisting of debt for borrowed money, finance leases, disqualified and preferred stock and advances under any Receivables Facility. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Credit Agreement as consolidated net income increased by interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, initial public company costs, restructuring charges, write-offs and noncash charges, non-controlling interest expense, net cost savings in connection with any acquisition, disposition, or other permitted investment under the Credit Agreement, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or unusual gains and losses, reimbursable insurance costs, cash expenses related to earn outs, and insured losses.\nThe Credit Agreement establishes a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, defined as Covenant Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense. The minimum Interest Coverage Ratio is required to be at least 2.00x for the term of the Credit Agreement.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other financial condition tests and covenants. Our continued ability to meet those financial ratios, tests and covenants can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet those ratios, tests and covenants.\nAt September 29, 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nFuture Liquidity and Contractual Obligations\nWe have historically relied on available cash, recurring cash flow provided by operations and Aramarks centralized cash management program to fund operations. Going forward we will primarily rely on cash and recurring cash flow provided by operations to fund our operations. We also have access to our $300 million Revolving Credit Facility and expect to have access to capital markets for additional funding. The cost and availability of debt financing will be influenced by market conditions and our future credit ratings.\nWe believe that we will meet known and likely future cash requirements through the combination of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances, available borrowings under our financing arrangements and access to capital markets.\nFollowing the Separation, our recurring cash needs are primarily directed toward working capital requirements to support ongoing business activities, investments in growth initiatives, capital expenditures, acquisitions, interest payments and repayment of borrowings. Our ability to fund these needs will depend, in part, on our ability to generate or raise cash in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory, and other factors that are beyond our control.\nThe following table summarizes our future obligations for long-term borrowings, estimated interest payments, finance leases, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, purchase obligations and other liabilities as of September 29, 2023 (dollars in thousands):\nPayments Due by Period\nContractual Obligations as of September 29, 2023 Total Less than\n1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than\n5 years\nLong-term borrowings(1)\n1,500,000 26,250 878,750 595,000 -\nEstimated interest payments(2)\n362,574 86,568 176,958 99,049 -\nFinance lease obligations 153,724 33,300 56,522 38,915 24,987\nOperating leases 73,525 22,274 28,841 13,260 9,150\nPurchase obligations(3)\n7,400 7,400 - - -\nOther liabilities(4)\n3,400 3,400 - - -\n$ 238,049 $ 66,374 $ 85,363 $ 52,175 $ 34,137\n______________________\n(1)Excludes the $11.1 million reduction to long-term borrowings from debt issuance costs\n(2)Interest payments on long-term debt includes interest due on outstanding debt obligations under our Credit Agreement. Payments related to variable debt are based on applicable rates at September 29, 2023 plus the specified margin in the Credit Agreement for each period presented.\n(3)Represents purchase commitments for inventory.\n(4)Includes severance.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited Combined Financial Statements included in this Annual Report. We have chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner.\nIn preparing our Combined Financial Statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that, among other things, affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change, and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance. If actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made, the reported results could be materially affected.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and changes to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate and recognize over 93% of our total revenue from route servicing contracts on both Uniforms, which we generally manufacture, and Workplace Supplies, such as mats, towels, and linens that are procured from third-party suppliers. Revenue from these contracts represent a single-performance obligation and are recognized over time as services are performed based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method). We generate our remaining revenue primarily from the direct sale of uniforms to customers, with such revenue being recognized when our performance obligation is satisfied, typically upon the transfer of control of the promised product to the customer.\nGoodwill\nAnnually, in our fiscal fourth quarter, we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level. This assessment may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Examples of qualitative factors include, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, entity-specific events, events affecting reporting units and sustained changes in our stock price. If results of the qualitative assessment indicate a more likely than not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, a quantitative test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value using discounted cash flow calculations of each reporting unit with its estimated net book value. Historically, Vestis has represented one reporting unit under Aramarks structure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed the annual impairment test for goodwill using a quantitative testing approach. Based on our evaluation performed, we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its respective carrying amount, and therefore, we determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nThe determination of fair value for the Vestis reporting unit includes assumptions, which are considered Level 3 inputs, that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows, the underlying margin projection assumptions, future growth rates and the discount rate. If our assumptions or estimates in our fair value calculations change or if future cash flows, margin projections or future growth rates vary from what was expected, this may impact our impairment analysis and could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and result in a decline in fair value that may trigger future impairment charges.\nWe believe that an accounting estimate relating to goodwill impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to change from time to time and the recognition of an impairment could have a significant impact on our Combined Statements of Income.\nLitigation and Claims\nFrom time to time, we and our subsidiaries are party to various legal actions, proceedings and investigations involving claims incidental to the conduct of our businesses, including actions by customers, employees, government entities and third parties, including under federal, state, international, national, provincial and local employment laws, wage and hour laws, discrimination laws, immigration laws, human health and safety laws, import and export controls and customs laws, environmental laws, false claims or whistleblower statutes, tax codes, antitrust and competition laws, customer protection statutes, procurement regulations, intellectual property laws, supply chain laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, lobbying laws, motor carrier safety laws, data privacy and security laws, or claims alleging negligence and/or breach of contractual and other obligations. We consider the measurement of litigation reserves as a critical accounting estimate because of the significant uncertainty in some cases relating to the outcome of potential claims or litigation and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of potential liability involved, coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from litigation or other claims. In determining legal reserves, we consider, among other issues:\ninterpretation of contractual rights and obligations;\nthe status of government regulatory initiatives, interpretations, and investigations;\nthe status of settlement negotiations;\nprior experience with similar types of claims;\nwhether there is available insurance; and\nadvice of counsel.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe encounter credit loss risks associated with the collection of receivables. We analyze historical experience, current general and specific industry economic conditions, industry concentrations, such as exposure to small and medium-sized businesses, the nonprofit healthcare sector, federal and local governments, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount in estimating credit losses. The accounting estimate related to the allowance for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from time to time and credit losses could potentially have a material impact on our results of operations.\nInventories and Rental Merchandise In Service\nWe record an inventory obsolescence reserve for obsolete, excess, and slow-moving inventory. In calculating our inventory obsolescence reserve, we analyze historical and projected data regarding customer demand within specific product categories and make assumptions regarding economic conditions within customer specific industries, as well as style and product changes. Our accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate because customer demand in certain industries can be variable and changes in our reserve for inventory obsolescence could materially affect our results of operations.\nRental merchandise in service is valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Rental merchandise in service is amortized over its useful life, which ranges from one to four years. The amortization rates are based on industry experience, intended use of the merchandise, our specific experience, and wear tests performed by us. These factors are critical to determining the amount of rental merchandise in service and related cost of services provided that are presented in the Combined Financial Statements. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating income if management makes significant changes to these estimates.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nWe defer employee sales commissions earned by our sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract. The deferred costs are amortized using the portfolio approach on a straight-line basis over the average period of benefit, approximately nine years, and are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis.\nNew Accounting Standards Updates\nSee Note 1 to the audited Combined Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting standards updates, including the expected dates of adoption. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This exposure results from revenues and profits denominated in foreign currencies being translated into U.S. dollars and from our legal entities entering into transactions denominated in a foreign currency other than their functional currency. We currently do not enter into financial instruments to manage this foreign currency translation risk. Approximately 9% of our consolidated revenue and profit are generated from foreign denominated revenue and profit.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk through fluctuations in interest rates on our debt obligations. Our outstanding Term Loan Facilities bear interest at variable rates. As a result, increases in interest rates could increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. We seek to manage exposure to adverse interest rate changes through our normal operating and financing activities, as well as through entering into interest rate derivative agreements. Excluding the impact of interest rate derivative agreements, each 1% increase in interest rates on the Term Loan Facilities would increase our annual interest expense by approximately $15 million based on the aggregate\nprincipal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facilities as of September 29, 2023. As of September 29, 2023, $1,500 million aggregate principal amount was outstanding under the Term Loan Facilities. Item 8.

Subsequent Events\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Vestis Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of Vestis Corporation (the \"Company\") as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the related combined statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and parents equity, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInsurance - Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAramark (the Parent) insures portions of its risk in general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation liability and property liability through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary, to enhance its risk financing strategies. The Parents reserves for retained costs associated with the Parents casualty program are estimated through actuarial methods, with the assistance of third-party actuaries, using loss development assumptions based on claims history. The Parent allocates certain costs associated to the captive insurance subsidiary to the Company. The Company does not recognize liabilities related to claims from general liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation liability and property liability on the combined balance sheets as the Parent's captive insurance subsidiary is the primary responsible party related to these obligations. The Parent's captive insurance subsidiary had estimated reserves of approximately $68.4 million and $61.7 million at September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, related to claims arising from the Company's operations.\nWe identified the valuation of insurance reserves and the allocation of associated costs to the Company as a critical audit matter because estimating projected settlement value of reported and unreported claims arising from the Companys operations involves significant estimation by management. This required high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the insurance reserves and the allocation of associated costs to the Company included the following, among others:\nWe evaluated the inputs used to estimate the insurance reserves by:\n\u25e6Reading the insurance policies and comparing the coverage and terms to the assumptions used.\n\u25e6Testing the underlying historical claims data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis.\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we:\n\u25e6Evaluated the actuarial method used to estimate the insurance reserves.\n\u25e6Compared prior-year assumptions of expected development and ultimate loss to actuals incurred during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of the insurance reserves.\n\u25e6Developed independent estimates of the insurance reserves, including loss data and industry claim development factors, and compared our estimates to recorded estimates.\nWe tested the allocation of costs associated to the captive insurance subsidiary to the Company.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nDecember 21, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2023.\nVESTIS CORPORATION\nCOMBINED BALANCE SHEETS\nSEPTEMBER 29, 2023 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2022\n(in thousands)\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 36,051 $ 23,736\nReceivables (net of allowances: 2023 -

NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nVestis Corporation (\"Vestis\", the \"Company\", we or us) is a carve-out business of Aramark (Aramark). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to Vestis, we, us, our, and the Company refer to (i) Aramarks uniform services business prior to the Separation and (ii) Vestis Corporation and its subsidiaries following the Separation.\nOn May 10, 2022, Aramark announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate its Uniform and\nCareer Apparel business. On September 30, 2023 (the \"Distribution Date\"), Aramark completed the previously announced spin-off of Vestis (the \"Spin-Off,\" or the Separation). The Separation was completed through a distribution of the Company's common stock to holders of record of Aramarks common stock as of the close of business on September 20, 2023 (the Distribution), which resulted in the issuance of approximately 131 million shares of common stock. Aramark stockholders of record received one share of Vestis common stock for every two shares of common stock, par value $0.01, of Aramark. As a result of the Distribution, the Company became an independent public company. Our common stock is listed under the symbol VSTS on the NYSE.\nVestis is a leading provider of uniforms and workplace supplies across the United States and Canada. The Company provides uniforms, mats, towels, linens, restroom supplies, first-aid supplies and safety products. The Companys customer base participates in a wide variety of industries, including manufacturing, hospitality, retail, food processing, pharmaceuticals, healthcare and automotive. The Company serves customers ranging from small, family-owned operations with a single location to large corporations and national franchises with multiple locations. The Companys customers value the uniforms and workplace supplies it delivers as its services and products can help them reduce operating costs, enhance their brand image, maintain a safe and clean workplace and focus on their core business. The Company leverages its broad footprint and its supply chain, delivery fleet and route logistics capabilities to serve customers on a recurring basis, typically weekly, and primarily through multi-year contracts. In addition, the Company offers customized uniforms through direct sales agreements, typically for large, regional or national companies.\nThe Company manages and evaluates its business activities based on geography and, as a result, determined that its United States and Canada businesses are its operating segments. The Companys operating segments are also its reportable segments. The United States and Canada reportable segments both provide a range of uniforms and workplace supplies programs. The Companys uniforms business (Uniforms) generates revenue from the rental, servicing and direct sale of uniforms to customers, including the design, sourcing, manufacturing, customization, personalization, delivery, laundering, sanitization, repair and replacement of uniforms. The uniform options include shirts, pants, outerwear, gowns, scrubs, high visibility garments, particulate-free garments and flame-resistant garments, along with shoes and accessories. The Companys workplace supplies business (Workplace Supplies) generates revenue from the rental and servicing of workplace supplies, including managed restroom supply services, first-aid supplies and safety products, floor mats, towels and linens.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Combined Financial Statements reflect the combined historical results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 and the financial position as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 for the Company and are denominated in United States (U.S.) dollars. The Combined Financial Statements have been derived from Aramarks historical accounting records and were prepared on a standalone basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses of the Company have been reflected in these Combined Financial Statements on a historical cost basis, as included in the consolidated financial statements of Aramark, using the historical accounting policies applied by Aramark. Historically, separate financial statements have not been prepared for the Company, and it has not operated as a standalone business from Aramark.\nThe Companys business has historically functioned together with other Aramark businesses. Accordingly, the Company relied on certain of Aramarks corporate support functions to operate. The Combined Financial Statements include all revenues and costs directly attributable to the Company and an allocation of expenses related to certain Aramark corporate functions (see Note 5. Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment). These expenses have been\nallocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount or other drivers. The Company considers these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services or the benefit received. However, the allocations may not be indicative of the actual expense that would have been incurred had the Company operated as an independent, standalone public entity, nor are they indicative of the Companys future expenses.\nFollowing the Separation, certain functions that Aramark provided to the Company prior to the separation are being provided to the Company by Aramark under a transition services agreement or using the Companys own resources or third-party service providers. The Company incurred certain one-time charges in its establishment as a standalone public company, and will incur ongoing additional costs associated with operating as an independent, publicly traded company. It is impracticable to estimate the costs that would have been incurred as a standalone public company during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021.\nThe Combined Financial Statements include assets and liabilities that have been determined to be specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to the Company.\nThe Companys cash flows within the United States segment are transferred to Aramark regularly as part of Aramarks centralized cash management program. The Companys cash flows within the Canada segment are reinvested locally. The cash and cash equivalents held by Aramark at the corporate level are not specifically identifiable to the Company and therefore were not allocated to any of the periods presented. Only cash amounts specifically attributable to the Company are reflected in the Combined Balance Sheets. Transfers of cash, both to and from Aramarks central cash management system, are reflected as a component of Net parent investment on the Combined Balance Sheets and in Net cash used in financing activities on the accompanying Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\nHistorically, Aramarks long-term borrowings and related interest expense, exclusive of certain financing lease obligations, have not been attributed to the Company for any of the periods presented because the borrowings are neither directly attributable to the Company nor is the Company the primary legal obligor of such borrowings. However, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement on September 29, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\") and borrowings under the Credit Agreement have been included in the Combined Financial Statements (see Note 4. Borrowings).\nAll intercompany transactions and balances within the Company have been eliminated. Transactions between the Company and Aramark have been included in these Combined Financial Statements and are considered related party transactions (see Note 5. Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment).\nThe Provision for Income Taxes in the Combined Statements of Income has been calculated as if the Company filed a separate tax return and was operating as a standalone company. Therefore, income tax expense, cash tax payments and items of current and deferred income taxes may not be reflective of the Companys actual tax balances prior to or subsequent to the distribution.\nFiscal Year\nThe Companys fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period which ends on the Friday nearest to September 30th. The fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021 were each 52-week periods.\nNew Accounting Standards Updates\nAdopted Standards (from most to least recent date of issuance)\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued an ASU which required that an entity provide certain annual disclosures when they have received government assistance. The guidance was effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company adopted the ASU prospectively and adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements.\nStandards Not Yet Adopted (from most to least recent date of issuance)\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued an ASU to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs, which may be referred to as reverse factoring, payables finance or structured payables arrangements. The guidance will require\nthat a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose the programs nature, activity and potential magnitude. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued an ASU which requires that an entity (acquirer) recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers as if it had originated the contracts. The guidance is effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements.\nOther new accounting pronouncements recently issued or newly effective were not applicable to the Company, did not have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements or are not expected to have a material impact on the Combined Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates and recognizes over 93% of its total revenue from route servicing contracts on both Uniforms, which the Company generally manufactures, and Workplace Supplies, such as mats, towels, and linens that are procured from third-party suppliers. Revenue from these contracts represent a single-performance obligation and are recognized over time as services are performed based on the nature of services provided and contractual rates (output method). The Company generates its remaining revenue primarily from the direct sale of uniforms to customers, with such revenue being recognized when the Companys performance obligation is satisfied, typically upon the transfer of control of the promised product to the customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for the services or products described above and is presented net of sales and other taxes we collect on behalf of governmental authorities.\nCertain customer route servicing contracts include terms and conditions that include components of variable consideration, which are typically in the form of consideration paid to a customer based on performance metrics specified within the contract. Some contracts provide for customer discounts or rebates that can be earned through the achievement of specified volume levels. Each component of variable consideration is earned based on the Companys actual performance during the measurement period specified within the contract. To determine the transaction price, the Company estimates the variable consideration using the most likely amount method, based on the specific contract provisions and known performance results during the relevant measurement period. When assessing if variable consideration should be limited, the Company evaluates the likelihood of whether uncontrollable circumstances could result in a significant reversal of revenue. The Companys performance period generally corresponds with the monthly invoice period. No significant constraints on the Companys revenue recognition were applied during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 or fiscal 2021. The Company reassesses these estimates during each reporting period. The Company maintains a liability for these discounts and rebates within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Combined Balance Sheets. Variable consideration can also include consideration paid to a customer at the beginning of a contract. This type of variable consideration is capitalized as an asset (in Other Assets on the Combined Balance Sheets) and is amortized over the life of the contract as a reduction to revenue in accordance with the accounting guidance for revenue recognition.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the Combined Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The Company utilizes key estimates in preparing the financial statements including environmental estimates, goodwill, intangibles, insurance reserves, income taxes and long-lived assets. These estimates are based on historical information, current trends and information available from other sources. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are classified\nbased upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. The hierarchical levels related to the subjectivity of the valuation inputs are defined as follows:\nLevel 1-inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets\nLevel 2-inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument\nLevel 3-inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe Companys financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, financing leases and borrowings. Management believes that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, financing leases and borrowings are representative of their respective fair values.\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe Companys assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of such assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value measurement of the assets are considered to be Level 3 measurements.\nAcquisitions\nThe Company had no business acquisitions during fiscal 2023. The Company completed business acquisitions with aggregate purchase price of approximately $17.2 million and $15.8 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively. The results of operations of these acquisitions have been included in the Companys combined financial results since their respective acquisition dates. These acquisitions were not significant in relation to the Companys combined financial results and, therefore, pro forma financial information has not been presented.\nMerger and Integration Costs\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company incurred merger and integration costs of $22.2 million as a result of the AmeriPride acquisition that occurred during fiscal year 2018. The expenses mainly related to costs for transitional employees and integration-related consulting costs and charges related to plant consolidations, mainly asset write-downs, the implementation of a new laundry enterprise resource planning system and other expenses.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes all changes to parents equity during a period, except those related to the net parent investment. Components of comprehensive income include net income, pension plan adjustments (net of tax) and changes in foreign currency translation adjustments (net of tax).\nThe summary of the components of comprehensive income is as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nPre-Tax Amount Tax Effect After-Tax Amount Pre-Tax Amount Tax Effect After-Tax Amount Pre-Tax Amount Tax Effect After-Tax Amount\nNet Income $ 213,158 $ 141,679 $ 74,270\nPension plan adjustments (884) 229 (655) 2,621 (924) 1,697 1,020 (665) 355\nForeign currency translation adjustments 2,251 (1,089) 1,162 (22,893) 1,122 (21,771) 6,079 283 6,362\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income 1,367 (860) 507 (20,272) 198 (20,074) 7,099 (382) 6,717\nComprehensive Income $ 213,665 $ 121,605 $ 80,987\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss consists of the following (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nPension plan adjustments $ (5,070) $ (4,414)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(26,103) (27,266)\n$ (31,173) $ (31,680)\nCurrency Translation\nThe Companys Canadian subsidiarys functional currency is the local currency of operations, and the net assets of its Canadian operations are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar results that arise from such translation are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in parents equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nReceivables\nReceivables represents amounts due from customers and is presented net of allowance for credit losses. Judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of receivables and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. The Company estimates and reserves for its credit loss exposure based on historical experience, current general and specific industry economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount in estimating credit losses. Credit loss expense is classified within Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Combined Statements of Income. When an account is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amounts recognized in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 relating to allowance for credit losses, which are netted against Receivables in the Combined Balance Sheets, are as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nBalance, beginning of year $ 29,100 $ 34,104\nAdditions: Charged to Income\n20,500 9,704\nReductions: Deductions from Reserves(1)\n(24,534) (14,708)\nBalance, end of year $ 25,066 $ 29,100\n__________________\n(1)Amounts determined not to be collectible and charged against the reserve and translation.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (principally the first-in, first-out method) or net realizable value. The Company records valuation adjustments to its inventories if the cost of inventory on hand exceeds the amount it expects to realize from the ultimate sale or disposal of the inventory. These estimates are based on managements judgment regarding future demand and market conditions and analysis of historical experience. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Companys reserve for inventory was approximately $18.7 million and $48.8 million, respectively. The inventory reserve is determined based on history and projected customer consumption and specific identification. During fiscal 2022, the Company decided to no longer sell certain personal protective equipment (PPE), which required inventory charges to reduce the carrying value of PPE to a zero net realizable value. The Company recorded $26.2 million in inventory charges within Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) in the Combined Statements of Income during fiscal 2022 to reflect the net realizable value of certain PPE inventory. No charges were recorded in fiscal 2023 related to PPE and the decrease in the inventory reserve from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by the write-off of the previously reserved PPE inventory.\nThe components of net inventories are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nRaw Materials $ 35,332 $ 23,463\nWork in Process 1,104 1,998\nFinished Goods 138,284 157,978\n$ 174,719 $ 183,439\nRental merchandise in service\nRental merchandise in service represents personalized work apparel, linens and other rental items in service. Rental merchandise in service is valued at cost less amortization, calculated using the straight-line method. Rental merchandise in service is amortized over its useful life, which primarily range from one to four years. The amortization rates are based on the Companys specific experience and wear tests performed by the Company. These factors are critical to determining the amount of rental merchandise in service and related Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) that are presented in the Combined Financial Statements. Material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating income if management makes significant changes to these estimates.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, the Company recorded $344.5 million, $313.4 million and $300.2 million, respectively, of amortization related to rental merchandise in service within Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) on the Combined Statements of Income.\nOther current assets\nOther current assets as presented in the Combined Balance Sheets is primarily comprised of prepaid insurance and prepaid taxes and licenses.\nProperty and Equipment and Operating Lease Right-of-use Assets\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis. When a decision has been made to dispose of property and equipment prior to the end of the previously estimated useful life, depreciation estimates are revised to reflect the use of the asset over the shortened estimated useful life. Gains and losses on dispositions are included in operating results. Maintenance and repairs are charged to current operations and replacements, and significant improvements that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized. The estimated useful lives for the major categories of property and equipment are 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements and three to 10 years for equipment. Depreciation expense during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $103.8 million, $103.3 million and $102.3 million, respectively.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed a strategic review of certain administrative locations, taking into account facility capacity and current utilization, among other factors. Based on this review, the Company vacated or otherwise reduced its usage at certain of these locations, resulting in an analysis of the recoverability of the assets associated with the locations. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $7.7 million within its United States segment, which is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Combined Statements of Income for fiscal 2023. The non-cash impairment charge consisted of operating lease right-of-use assets ($7.1 million) and other costs ($0.6 million).\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company completed the sale of a property for cash proceeds of $9.6 million. As a result, the Company recorded a gain on disposal of $6.8 million within the United States segment, which is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Combined Statements of Income for fiscal 2023.\nOther Assets\nOther assets as presented in the Combined Balance Sheets is primarily comprised of employee sales commissions, computer software costs, equity method investments, consideration payable to a customer at the beginning of the contract, noncurrent pension assets, preparation costs and long-term receivables.\nEmployee sales commissions represent commission payments made to employees related to new or retained business contracts (see Note 7. Revenue Recognition). Computer software costs represent capitalized costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use, and are amortized over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of three to 10 years.\nThe Company accounts for investments in unconsolidated entities where it exercises significant influence, but does not have control, using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company recognizes its share of the investees net income or loss. Equity method investments represent the 39% ownership interest in ARATEX, a Japanese uniform solutions company.\nOn September 22, 2023, the Company sold its 25% interest in Sanikleen, a Japanese linen supply company for $51.9 million in cash resulting in a pre-tax gain on sale of this equity investment of $51.8 million for fiscal 2023. The pre-tax gain is included in Gain on Sale of Equity Investment, net on the Combined Statements of Income.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities as presented in the Combined Balance Sheets is primarily comprised of current deferred income, taxes, insurance, environmental reserves (see Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies), rebates and a deferral related to the employer portion of social security taxes as permitted under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities as presented in the Combined Balance Sheets is primarily comprised of environmental reserves (see Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies), asset retirement obligations (see Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies) and noncurrent deferred income.\nInsurance\nAramark insures portions of its risk in general liability, automobile liability, workers compensation liability and property liability through a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary (the Captive), to enhance its risk financing strategies. The Captive is subject to regulations within its domicile of Bermuda, including regulations established by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA) relating to levels of liquidity and solvency as such concepts are defined by the BMA. The Captive was in compliance with these regulations as of September 29, 2023. Aramark allocates certain costs associated to the Captive to the Company. The Company does not recognize liabilities related to claims from general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation liability on the Combined Balance Sheets as Aramarks Captive subsidiary is the primary responsible party related to these obligations. Aramarks Captive insurance subsidiary had estimated reserves of approximately $68.4 million and $61.7 million at September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively, related to claims arising from the Companys operations. Aramarks reserves for retained costs associated\nwith Aramarks casualty program are estimated through actuarial methods, with the assistance of third-party actuaries, using loss development assumptions based on claims history. The Company entered into an independent property insurance policy and was no longer under Aramarks property insurance policy effective June 1, 2023. No liabilities have been incurred as of September 29, 2023 under the new property insurance policy.\nEnvironmental Matters\nCapital expenditures for ongoing environmental remediation and compliance measures were recorded in Property and Equipment and related expenses were included in the normal operating expenses of conducting business. The Company accrued for environmental-related activities for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs could be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. Accrued amounts were primarily recorded on an undiscounted basis (see Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies).\nIncome Taxes\nThe Companys operations are included in the tax returns of Aramark. Aramark remits funds to or receives refunds from governmental jurisdictions on behalf of the Companys operations related to income taxes. In the future, as a standalone entity, the Company will file tax returns on its own behalf. Income taxes are presented in the Combined Financial Statements, whereas current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities of Aramark are attributed to the Company in a manner that is systematic, rational and consistent with the asset and liability method prescribed by the accounting guidance for income taxes. The income tax provision of the Company is prepared using the separate return method, which applies the accounting guidance for income taxes to the standalone financial statements as if the Company was a separate taxpayer and a standalone enterprise. The Company believes the assumptions supporting the allocation and presentation of income taxes on a separate return basis are reasonable.\nThe Company has reviewed its needs in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings of its Canadian subsidiary and continues to invest earnings outside of the United States to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property and equipment needs. As a result, the Company is permanently reinvested with respect to all of its historical foreign earnings related to its Canadian subsidiary of $28.9 million and $17.2 million as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, respectively. The foreign withholding tax associated with remitting these earnings is immaterial as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022. Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of its Canadian subsidiary that are indefinitely reinvested.\nAramark conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a number of tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, including foreign, the Company records accruals for uncertain tax positions, based on the technical support for the positions, past audit experience with similar situations and the potential interest and penalties related to the matters. The effects of tax adjustments and settlements from taxing authorities are presented in the Combined Financial Statements in the period to which they relate as if the Company was a separate filer.\nAramark maintains valuation allowances where it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances are included in the tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, Aramarks management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, carryback and carryforward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of the realization of a deferred tax asset.\nNet Parent Investment\nNet parent investment in the Combined Balance Sheets is presented in lieu of stockholders equity and represents Aramarks historic investment in the Company, the accumulated net earnings after taxes of the Company and the net effect of the transactions with the allocations from Aramark. All transactions reflected in Net parent investment in the accompanying Combined Balance Sheets have been considered as financing activities for purposes of the Combined Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor additional information, see Basis of Presentation above and Note 5. Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment.\nInterest Expense and Other, net\nInterest Expense and Other, net as presented in the Combined Statements of Income is primarily comprised of interest expense recognized on financing leases (see Note 8. Leases) and the Companys share of the financial results for its equity method investment. There was minimal interest expense incurred to date under the new Credit Agreement entered on September 29, 2023. See Note 4. Borrowings for additional detail.\nImpact of COVID-19\nCOVID-19 adversely affected global economies, disrupted global supply chains and labor force participation and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. COVID-19 related disruptions negatively impacted the Companys financial and operating results beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2020 through the first half of fiscal 2021. The Companys financial results started to improve during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continued to improve throughout fiscal 2022 as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted and operations re-opened.\nThe CARES Act provided for deferred payment of the employer portion of social security taxes through the end of calendar 2020, with 50% of the deferred amount due December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% due December 31, 2022. Deferred social security taxes of $16.6 million were paid during both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023.\nRegarding our operations within Canada, the Canadian government provided companies with various forms of relief from COVID-19, including labor related tax credits. These labor related tax credits were generally earned if companies retained employees on their payroll, rather than furloughing or terminating employees as a result of the business disruption caused by COVID-19. The Company qualified for these tax credits. The Company recorded approximately $0.4 million and $17.9 million of labor related tax credits within Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively. The Company does not expect to receive additional tax credits related to COVID-19 relief at this time.\nThe Company accounts for these labor related tax credits as a reduction to the expense that they were intended to compensate in the period in which the corresponding expense was incurred and there was reasonable assurance the Company would both receive the tax credits and comply with all conditions attached to the tax credits.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nDuring fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the Company executed finance lease transactions. The present value of the future rental obligations was $42.6 million, $28.9 million and $27.6 million for the respective periods, which is included in Property and Equipment, at cost and Noncurrent Financing Lease Obligations on the Combined Balance Sheets. The increase in fiscal 2023 was primarily driven by increasing the amount of finance lease transactions executed in connection with the Companys plan.\nNOTE 2. SEVERANCE:\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company approved headcount reductions to streamline and improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of operational and administrative functions. As a result of these actions, severance charges of $7.6 million were recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2023. As of September 29, 2023, the Company had an accrual of approximately $3.4 million related to unpaid severance obligations.\nDuring fiscal 2021, the Company approved action plans to streamline and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations, including a series of facility consolidations and closures. As a result of these actions, severance charges of $9.0 million were recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) on the Combined Statements of Income for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the unpaid obligations for severance and related costs as of September 29, 2023, which are included in Accrued payroll and related expenses on the Combined Balance Sheets.\n(dollars in thousands) September 30, 2022 Charges Payments and Other September 29, 2023\nFiscal 2023 Severance $ - $ 7,588 $ (4,174) $ 3,414\nFiscal 2021 Severance $ 3,448 $ - $ (3,448) $ -\nTotal $ 3,448 $ 7,588 $ (7,622) $ 3,414\nThe following table summarizes the unpaid obligations for severance and related costs as of September 30, 2022, which are included in Accrued payroll and related expenses on the Combined Balance Sheets.\n(dollars in thousands) October 1, 2021 Charges Payments and Other September 30, 2022\nFiscal 2021 Severance $ 9,092 $ - $ (5,644) $ 3,448\nFiscal 2020 Severance 157 - (157) -\nTotal $ 9,249 $ - $ (5,801) $ 3,448\nNOTE 3. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS:\nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized and is subject to an impairment test that is conducted annually or more frequently if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events indicates that potential impairment exists. Based on Aramarks historical structure, goodwill for the Company is retained within one reporting unit. The annual impairment test is performed as of the end of the fiscal month of August. If results of the qualitative assessment indicate a more likely than not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed, a quantitative test is performed by comparing the estimated fair value, calculated using a discounted cash flow method, of the reporting unit with its estimated net book value. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the annual impairment test for goodwill was performed by Aramark using a quantitative testing approach and no impairment was identified.\nThe determination of fair value for the reporting unit includes assumptions, which are considered Level 3 inputs, that are subject to risk and uncertainty. The discounted cash flow calculations are dependent on several subjective factors, including the timing of future cash flows, the underlying margin projection assumptions, future growth rates and the discount rate. If assumptions or estimates in the fair value calculations change or if future cash flows, margin projections or future growth rates vary from what was expected, this may impact the impairment analysis and could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and result in a decline in fair value that may trigger future impairment charges.\nChanges in total goodwill during fiscal 2023 are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 30, 2022 Acquisitions Translation September 29, 2023\nUnited States $ 896,237 $ - $ - $ 896,237\nCanada 67,138 - 168 67,306\nTotal $ 963,375 $ - $ 168 $ 963,543\nChanges in total goodwill during fiscal 2022 are as follows (in thousands):\nOctober 1, 2021 Acquisitions Translation September 30, 2022\nUnited States $ 896,237 $ - $ - $ 896,237\nCanada 68,659 - (1,521) 67,138\n$ 964,896 $ - $ (1,521) $ 963,375\nOther intangible assets consist of (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nGross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount Gross Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Amount\nCustomer relationship assets $ 383,869 $ (161,773) $ 222,096 $ 383,801 $ (135,748) $ 248,053\nTrade names 16,512 - 16,512 16,211 - 16,211\n$ 400,381 $ (161,773) $ 238,608 $ 400,012 $ (135,748) $ 264,264\nDuring fiscal 2022, the Company acquired customer relationship assets with a value of $15.1 million. Customer relationship assets are being amortized principally on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit with a weighted average life of approximately 14 years. The Canadian Linen trade name, which is our sole trade name, is an indefinite lived intangible asset and is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The Company utilized the relief-from-royalty method, which considers the discounted estimated royalty payments that are expected to be avoided as a result of the trade name being owned. The Companys annual trade name impairment test was completed by Aramark for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, which did not result in an impairment charge. Amortization of other intangible assets for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was approximately $26.0 million, $25.9 million and $25.0 million, respectively.\nBased on the recorded balances at September 29, 2023, total estimated amortization of all acquisition-related intangible assets for fiscal years 2024 through 2028 are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 25,918\n2025 26,333\n2026 25,927\n2027 25,666\n2028 24,263\nNOTE 4. BORROWINGS:\nLong-term borrowings, net, are summarized in the following table (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023\nSenior secured term loan facility, due September 2025 $ 800,000\nSenior secured term loan facility, due September 2028 700,000\nTotal principal debt issued 1,500,000\nUnamortized debt issuance costs (11,057)\nLess - current portion (26,250)\nLong-term borrowings, net of current portion $ 1,462,693\nCredit Agreement\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement on September 29, 2023 (the \"Credit Agreement\"). The Credit Agreement includes senior secured term loan facilities consisting of the following as of September 29, 2023:\nA United States dollar denominated term loan A-1 tranche to the Company in the amount of $800 million (\"Term Loan A-1\"),\nA United States dollar denominated term loan A-2 tranche to the Company in the amount of $700 million (\"Term Loan A-2\"). The Term Loan A-2 includes $8.75M of principal payments each quarter until the maturity date in which the remaining unpaid principal amount is due.\nThe Company used approximately $1,457 million of the proceeds of the senior secured term loans to transfer cash to Aramark in connection with the separation and distribution. The Company recorded approximately $11.1 million of debt issuance costs related to the term loans. Debt issuance costs are presented as a reduction of debt in the Combined Balance Sheets and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the related debt using the effective interest method.\nThe Credit Agreement also includes a revolving credit facility available for loans in United States dollars and Canadian dollars with aggregate commitments of $300 million as of September 29, 2023. As of September 29, 2023, there was $300 million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility. The Company's revolving credit facility includes a $50 million sublimit for swingline loans. The Company's revolving credit facility includes a $30 million sublimit for letters of credit. The revolving credit facility may be drawn by the Company as well as by certain foreign subsidiaries. Each foreign borrower is subject to a sublimit of $100 million with respect to borrowings under the revolving credit facility. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the senior secured credit facilities, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the revolving credit facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The revolving credit facility is subject to a commitment fee ranging from a rate of 0.20% to 0.30% per annum. The actual rate within the range is based on a Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Additionally, the Company recorded approximately $2.6 million of debt issuance costs related to the revolving credit facility which are recorded as an asset in the Combined Balance Sheets and are amortized as a component of interest expense over the term of the related revolving credit facility using the effective interest method.\nThe Term Loan A-1 will mature on September 29, 2025 (the Term A-1 Maturity Date) and the Term Loan A-2 will mature on the earlier of (i) September 29, 2028 and (ii) the date (the Springing Maturity Date) that is 4 months prior to the Term A-1 Maturity Date if any portion of the Term Loan A-1 (or indebtedness which extends, renews, refunds or replaces any portion of the Term Loan A-1) remains outstanding as of such date and has, as of such date, a scheduled maturity date prior to September 29, 2028. The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on the earliest of (i) September 29, 2028, (ii) the Springing Maturity Date, and (iii) the date of termination of all of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility or the date on which the loans under the Revolving Credit Facility become due and payable or the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility are terminated.\nThe applicable margin on the Term Loan A-1 and the Term Loan A-2 for fiscal 2024 is 2.25% with respect to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) borrowings, subject to a floor of 0.00%. The applicable margin on the Term Loan A-1 and the Term Loan A-2 for fiscal 2025 and thereafter ranges from 1.50% to 2.50% based on the Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan A-1 and the Term Loan A-2 as of September 29, 2023 was 7.74%.\nThe Company carries debt at historical cost and discloses fair value. As of September 29, 2023, the book value of the Companys debt approximated fair value as the debt was issued on September 29, 2023.\nPrepayments\nThe Credit Agreement may be prepaid at any time. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with:\n100% of the net cash proceeds of all non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property subject to certain exceptions and customary reinvestment rights; provided, further, that such prepayment shall only be required to the extent net cash proceeds exceeds the greater of (a) $30,000,000 and (b) 7.5% of Covenant Adjusted EBITDA;\n100% of the net cash proceeds of all casualty events with respect to any equipment, fixed assets, or real property; provided, further, that such prepayment shall only be required to the extent proceeds related to the event in excess $10 million are not reinvested within the reinvestment period; and\n100% of the net cash proceeds of any incurrence of debt, but excluding proceeds from certain debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.\nGuarantees\nAll obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and, subject to certain exceptions, substantially all of the Companys existing and future wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by (i) pledges of 100% of the capital stock\nof the Companys domestic subsidiaries, (ii) pledges of 65% of the capital stock of the Companys foreign subsidiaries, and (iii) a security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all tangible assets of the Company or any of the Guarantors.\nCovenants\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Companys ability and the ability of its restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; issue preferred stock or provide guarantees; create liens on assets; engage in mergers or consolidations; sell or dispose of assets; pay dividends, make distributions or repurchase its capital stock; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make investments, loans or advances; create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to the Company from its restricted subsidiaries; amend material agreements governing the Companys subordinated debt; repay or repurchase any subordinated debt, except as scheduled or at maturity; make certain acquisitions; change the Companys fiscal year; and fundamentally change the Companys business. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary affirmative covenants, such as financial and other reporting, and certain events of default.\nThe Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a maximum Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness over unrestricted cash divided by Covenant Adjusted EBITDA, not to exceed 5.25x for any fiscal quarter ending prior to March 31, 2025, and not to exceed 4.50x for any fiscal quarter ending on or after March 31, 2025, subject to certain exceptions. Consolidated total indebtedness is defined in the Credit Agreement as total indebtedness consisting of debt for borrowed money, finance leases, disqualified and preferred stock and advances under any Receivables Facility. Covenant Adjusted EBITDA is defined in the Credit Agreement as consolidated net income increased by interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, initial public company costs, restructuring charges, write-offs and noncash charges, non-controlling interest expense, net cost savings in connection with any acquisition, disposition, or other permitted investment under the Credit Agreement, share-based compensation expense, non-recurring or unusual gains and losses, reimbursable insurance costs, cash expenses related to earn outs, and insured losses.\nThe Credit Agreement establishes a minimum Interest Coverage Ratio, defined as Covenant Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense. The minimum Interest Coverage Ratio is required to be at least 2.00x for the term of the Credit Agreement.\nAt September 29, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nDebt Maturities\nAt September 29, 2023, annual maturities on long-term borrowings maturing in the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\n2024 $ 26,250\n2025 843,750\n2026 35,000\n2027 35,000\n2028 560,000\nThereafter -\nTotal 1,500,000\nNOTE 5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND PARENT COMPANY INVESTMENT\nCorporate Allocations\nThe Companys Combined Financial Statements include general corporate expenses of Aramark, which were not historically allocated to the Company for certain support functions that are provided on a centralized basis by Aramark and are not recorded at the Company level, such as expenses related to finance, supply chain, human resources, information technology, share-based compensation, insurance and legal, among others (collectively, General Corporate Expenses). For purposes of these Combined Financial Statements, General Corporate Expenses have been allocated to the Company.\nGeneral Corporate Expenses are included in the Combined Statements of Income in Selling, general and administrative expenses with the impact related to Aramarks gasoline, diesel and natural gas derivative agreements included in Cost of services provided. These expenses have been allocated to the Company on the basis of direct usage where identifiable, with the remainder allocated on a pro rata basis of revenues, headcount or other drivers. Management believes the assumptions underlying the Combined Financial Statements, including the assumptions regarding allocating General Corporate Expenses from Aramark, are reasonable. Nevertheless, the Combined Financial Statements may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect the Companys combined results of operations, financial position and cash flows had it been a standalone public company during the periods presented. Actual costs that would have been incurred if the Company had been a standalone public company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure.\nDuring the years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, General Corporate Expenses allocated to the Company were $24.4 million, $37.5 million and $30.6 million, respectively.\nTransactions with the Parent\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company provides uniforms to certain food and support services contracts of Aramark in the United States and Canada, the terms of which are at fair market value. During the years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, these related party revenues were $54.6 million, $47.6 million and $36.0 million, respectively, with related costs of $49.7 million, $43.3 million and $33.9 million, respectively. Amounts receivable from Aramark for such revenues as of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022 were $1.2 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nParent Company Investment\nAll significant intercompany transactions between the Company and Aramark have been included in the Combined Financial Statements. The total net effect of these intercompany transactions is reflected in the Combined Statements of Cash Flows as a financing activity and in the Combined Balance Sheets as Net parent investment.\nNOTE 6. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS:\nAramark enters into contractual derivative arrangements to manage changes in market conditions related to exposure to fluctuating gasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel prices at the Company. Derivative instruments utilized during the period include gasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel agreements. All derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet of Aramark at fair value at the end of each quarter. The counterparties to Aramarks contractual derivative agreements are all major international financial institutions. Aramark is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties. Aramark continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of its counterparties, and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nAramarks contractual derivative arrangements have not been included within the Companys Combined Balance Sheets as the Company did not enter into such arrangements. The corresponding impact on earnings related to the contractual derivative arrangements have been allocated to the Company as the arrangements relate to gasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel utilized within the Companys operations.\nDerivatives not Designated in Hedging Relationships\nAramark entered into a series of pay fixed/receive floating gasoline and diesel fuel agreements based on the Department of Energy weekly retail on-highway index and natural gas agreements based on the Henry Hub New York Mercantile Exchange index in order to limit its exposure to price fluctuations for gasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel mainly for the Companys operations. As of September 29, 2023, Aramark has contracts for approximately 7.2 million gallons outstanding through June of fiscal 2024 related to the Company. Aramark does not record its gasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel agreements as hedges for accounting purposes. The impact on earnings related to the change in fair value of these unsettled contracts related to the Company was a gain of $1.6 million for fiscal 2023, a loss of $4.6 million for fiscal 2022 and a gain of $3.9 million for fiscal 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the location of loss (gain) for the Companys derivatives not designated as hedging instruments in the Combined Statements of Income (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nIncome Statement Location September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nGasoline, diesel and natural gas fuel agreements Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) $ 3,488 $ (3,212) $ (7,220)\nNOTE 7. REVENUE RECOGNITION:\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents revenue disaggregated by revenue source (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nUnited States:\nUniforms $ 1,067,825 $ 1,067,815 $ 1,076,264\nWorkplace Supplies 1,507,527 1,379,212 1,174,492\nTotal United States 2,575,352 2,447,027 2,250,756\nCanada:\nUniforms $ 100,403 $ 100,787 $ 100,517\nWorkplace Supplies 149,531 139,191 105,304\nTotal Canada 249,934 239,978 205,821\nTotal Revenue $ 2,825,286 $ 2,687,005 $ 2,456,577\nContract Balances\nThe Company defers sales commissions earned by its sales force that are considered to be incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract. The deferred costs are amortized using the portfolio approach on a straight-line basis over the average period of benefit, approximately nine years, and are assessed for impairment on a periodic basis. Determination of the amortization period and the subsequent assessment for impairment of the contract cost asset requires judgment. The Company expenses sales commissions as incurred if the amortization period is one year or less. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company has $104.4 million and $99.0 million, respectively, of employee sales commissions recorded as assets within Other Assets on the Companys Combined Balance Sheets. During the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, the Company recorded $20.1 million, $19.2 million and $18.0 million, respectively, of expense related to employee sales commissions within Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income.\nNOTE 8. LEASES:\nThe Company has lease arrangements primarily related to real estate, vehicles and equipment, which generally have terms of one to 30 years. Finance leases primarily relate to vehicles. The Company assesses whether an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, upon inception of the related contract. A right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases).\nAs a result of adopting ASC 842 on September 28, 2019 (the first day of fiscal 2020), the Company recognized operating lease liabilities and operating lease right-of-use assets on its Combined Balance Sheets. Operating lease right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use the underlying assets for the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease liabilities and\noperating lease right-of-use assets are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the estimated present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Deferred rent, tenant improvement allowances and prepaid rent are included in the operating lease right-of-use asset balances. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components are combined with the related lease components and accounted for as lease components for all classes of underlying assets.\nVariable lease payments, which primarily consist of real estate taxes, common area maintenance charges, insurance costs and other operating expenses, are not included in the operating lease right-of-use asset or operating lease liability balances and are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred. The Companys lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain they will be exercised or not, respectively. Options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of exercise are recognized as part of the operating lease right-of-use asset and operating lease liability balances.\nThe Company is required to discount its future minimum lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the incremental borrowing rate. As the Companys leases typically do not provide an implicit rate, the present value of our lease liability is determined using Aramarks incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement based on the geographic location of the lease and the remaining lease term. The incremental borrowing rate is calculated using a base line rate plus an applicable margin.\nThe following table summarizes the location of the operating and finance leases in the Companys Combined Balance Sheets (in thousands), as well as the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate:\nLeases Balance Sheet Location September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nAssets:\nOperating Operating Lease Right-of-use Assets $ 57,890 $ 72,567\nFinance Property and Equipment, net 121,930 99,294\nTotal lease assets $ 179,820 $ 171,861\nLiabilities:\nCurrent\nOperating Current operating lease liabilities $ 19,935 $ 20,899\nFinance Current maturities of financing lease obligations 27,659 20,482\nNoncurrent\nOperating Noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities 46,084 54,017\nFinance Noncurrent Financing Lease Obligations 105,217 86,783\nTotal lease liabilities $ 198,895 $ 182,181\nWeighted average remaining lease term (in years)\nOperating leases 4.7 5.1\nFinance leases 5.7 5.7\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases 4.4 % 3.6 %\nFinance leases 4.3 % 3.9 %\nThe following table summarizes the location of lease related costs in the Combined Statements of Income (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nLease Cost Income Statement Location September 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nOperating lease cost(1):\nFixed lease costs Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) / Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 23,119 $ 25,376 $ 27,698\nVariable lease costs Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) / Selling, general and administrative expenses 9,888 9,114 7,529\nShort-term lease costs Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) / Selling, general and administrative expenses 8,175 6,371 5,430\nFinance lease cost(2):\nAmortization of right-of-use-assets Depreciation and amortization 30,360 29,135 28,162\nInterest on lease liabilities Interest Expense and Other, net 4,174 3,205 3,399\nNet lease cost $ 75,716 $ 73,201 $ 72,218\n__________________\n(1)Excludes sublease income, which is immaterial.\n(2)Excludes variable lease costs, which are immaterial.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the period reported is as follows (in thousands):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows from operating leases(1)\n$ 24,208 $ 25,189 $ 27,102\nOperating cash flows from finance leases 4,174 3,205 3,399\nFinancing cash flows from finance leases 27,601 28,042 29,917\nLease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases 12,640 20,416 19,107\nFinance leases $ 42,581 $ 28,895 $ 27,578\n__________________\n(1)For fiscal 2023, excludes cash paid for variable and short-term lease costs of $9.9 million and $8.2 million, respectively, that are not included within the measurement of lease liabilities.

EMPLOYEE PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS:\nDefined Contribution Retirement Plans\nIn the United States and Canada, the Company maintains qualified contributory defined contribution retirement plans for all Company employees meeting certain eligibility requirements, with Company contributions to the plans based on earnings performance or salary level. The total expense of the above plans for Company employees for fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 was $9.1 million, $8.7 million and $8.6 million, respectively, which were recorded in Cost of services provided (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) and Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income.\nMultiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe Company contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements (CBAs) that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following respects:\n1.Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n2.If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\n3.If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nThe Companys participation in these plans for fiscal 2023 is outlined in the table below. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employee Identification Number (EIN) and the three-digit plan number, if applicable. Unless otherwise noted, the most recent Pension Protection Act (PPA) zone status available in 2023 and 2022 is for the plans two most recent fiscal year-ends. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plans actuary. Among other factors, plans in the critical and declining zone are generally less than 65% funded and projected to become insolvent in the next 15 or 20 years depending on the ratio of active to inactive participants, plans in the critical zone are generally less than 65% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. The FIP/RP Status Pending/Implemented column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (FIP) or a rehabilitation plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented. The contributions columns represent the recurring, required contributions made by the Company, which are typically based upon the number of employees participating\nwithin the plan. The last column lists the expiration date(s) of the CBA(s) to which the plans are subject. There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 contributions.\nPension Protection Act Zone Status Contributions by the Company (in thousands)\nPension Fund EIN/Pension Plan Number 2023 2022 FIP/RP Status Pending/ Implemented 2023 2022 2021 Surcharge Imposed Range of Expiration Dates of CBAs\nNational Retirement Fund 13-6130178/ 001 Critical Critical Implemented $ 2,994 $ 2,400 $ 2,545 No 3/25/2022 - 7/31/2026\nCentral States SE and SW Areas Pension Plan 36-6044243/ 001 Critical Critical and Declining Implemented 4,213 3,971 3,842 No 6/24/2022 - 9/22/2028\nRetail, Wholesale and Department Store International Union and Industry Pension Fund(1) 63-0708442/ 001 Critical and Declining Critical and Declining Implemented 413 408 425 No 4/18/2025 - 5/22/2026\nLocal No. 731, I.B. of T.

Judgment is required in determining the effective tax rate and in evaluating the tax return positions. Reserves are established when positions are more likely than not to be challenged and not sustained. Reserves are adjusted at each financial statement date to reflect the impact of audit settlements, expiration of statutes of limitation, developments in tax law and ongoing discussions with tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the income tax provision.\nAs of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the components of Deferred Income Taxes are as follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty and equipment $ 62,295 $ 63,148\nOther intangible assets including goodwill 77,603 70,982\nRental merchandise in service 80,579 66,572\nOperating Lease Right-of-use Asset 14,025 18,625\nEmployee compensation and benefits 10,806 14,119\nOther 12,019 7,954\nGross deferred tax liability 257,327 241,400\nDeferred tax assets:\nAccruals and allowances 16,939 18,200\nOperating lease liabilities 16,086 19,304\nNOL/credit carryforward and other 6,655 2,070\nGross deferred tax asset 39,680 39,574\nNet deferred tax liability $ 217,647 $ 201,826\nAs of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits follows (in thousands):\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nBalance, beginning of year $ 2,963 $ 2,854 $ 2,560\nAdditions based on tax positions taken in the current year 554 109 432\nAdditions for tax positions taken in prior years 875 - -\nReductions for remeasurements, settlements and payments - - (138)\nBalance, end of year $ 4,392 $ 2,963 $ 2,854\nThe Company has $1.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.2 million accrued for interest and penalties as of September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively, in the Combined Balance Sheets. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in \"Provision for Income Taxes\" on the Combined Statements of Income.\nGenerally, a number of years may elapse before a tax reporting year is audited and finally resolved. With few exceptions, Aramark is no longer subject to United States federal, state or local examinations by tax authorities before 2015. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of or resolution of a particular tax matter, Aramark does not anticipate any adjustments resulting from United States federal, state or foreign tax audits that would result in a material change to the financial condition or results of operations. Adequate amounts are established for any adjustments that may result from examinations for tax years after 2015. However, an unfavorable settlement of a particular issue may impact the Company.\nNOTE 11. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION:\nThe Company had no share-based compensation plans as of September 29, 2023. Certain employees of the Company have historically participated in Aramarks Stock Incentive Plan (Aramark Stock Plan).\nAll awards granted under Aramark Stock Plan are approved by Aramarks Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or another committee authorized by Aramarks Board of Directors. As such, all related equity account balances, other than allocations of share-based compensation expense (see Note 5. Related Party Transactions and Parent Company Investment), remain at the Aramark level. The following disclosure represents share-based compensation\nattributable to the Company based on the awards and terms previously granted to Company employees under Aramarks share-based payment plans and is representative of only those employees who are dedicated to the Company. Share-based compensation expense allocated to the Company for Aramark corporate employees who are not dedicated to the Company are included as a component of General Corporate Expenses. The allocation of share-based compensation expense for Aramark corporate employees was $3.9 million, $4.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nThe following table summarizes the share-based compensation expense (reversal) and related information for Time-Based Options (TBOs), Time-Based Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), Performance Stock Units (PSUs) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) classified as Selling, general and administrative expenses on the Combined Statements of Income (in thousands).\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nTBOs $ 1,125 $ 1,064 $ 2,319\nRSUs(1)\n8,013 8,992 8,310\nPSUs(2)\n866 451 -\nESPP(3)\n597 2,609 1,201\n$ 10,601 $ 13,116 $ 11,830\nTaxes related to share-based compensation $ 2,568 $ 2,729 $ 2,751\n__________________\n(1)Share-based compensation expense for RSUs decreased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to a decrease in annual grants issued in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 and due to an increase in the vesting period from three years to four years for fiscal 2023 grants.\n(2)Share-based compensation expense related to PSUs increased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to the issuance of new 2023 PSU grants. No PSUs were issued in fiscal 2021.\n(3)Share-based compensation expense related to the ESPP decreased during fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 as Aramark suspended its ESPP beginning in the second quarter of 2023.\nNo compensation expense was capitalized. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Aramark applied a forfeiture assumption of approximately 6.4% per annum in the calculation of such expenses. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, Aramark increased its estimated forfeiture assumption to 9.0% per annum based on actual forfeiture activity, which remained in effect throughout fiscal 2021, 2022 and 2023.\nThe below table summarizes the unrecognized compensation expense as of September 29, 2023 related to non-vested awards and the weighted-average period they are expected to be recognized:\nUnrecognized Compensation Expense\n(in thousands) Weighted-Average Period\n(Years)\nTBOs $ 1,989 2.7\nRSUs 9,425 2.5\nPSUs 2,567 2.5\nTotal $ 13,981\nStock Options\nTime-Based Options\nAramarks annual TBO grants for fiscal 2023 were awarded in November 2022, while Aramarks annual TBO grants for fiscal 2022 were awarded in November 2021 and Aramarks annual TBO grants for fiscal 2021 were awarded early in September 2020. The fiscal 2023 grants and TBO grants prior to September 2020 vest solely based upon continued employment over a four-year time period. The fiscal 2022 and 2021 TBO grants vest solely based upon continued employment over a three-year time period. All TBOs remain exercisable for 10 years from the date of grant.\nThe fair value of the TBOs granted was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of Aramarks stock price over the expected term of the stock options. The expected life represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is calculated using the simplified method, as permitted under SEC rules and regulations, due to the method providing a reasonable estimate in comparison to actual experience. The simplified method uses the midpoint between an options vesting date and contractual term. The risk-free rate is based on the United States Treasury security with terms equal to the expected life of the option as of the grant date. Compensation expense for TBOs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period during which employees perform related services.\nThe table below presents the weighted average assumptions and related valuations for TBOs.\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nExpected volatility 42 % 41 % 41 %\nExpected dividend yield 1.00% - 1.19% 1.18% - 1.29% 1 %\nExpected life (in years) 6.25 6.00 6.00\nRisk-free interest rate 3.65% - 4.21% 1.35% - 2.96% 1 %\nWeighted-average grant-date fair value $ 16.9 $ 13.4 $ 12.4\nA summary of TBO activity is presented below:\nOptions Shares\n(000s) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Aggregate Intrinsic Value\n($000s) Weighted-Average Remaining Term\n(Years)\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 700 $ 35.48\nGranted 128 $ 40.09\nExercised (379) $ 34.87\nForfeited and expired (99) $ 38.75\nOutstanding at September 29, 2023 350 $ 36.89 $ 458 5.9\nExercisable at September 29, 2023 171 $ 34.83 $ 454 3.0\nExpected to vest at September 29, 2023 158 $ 38.84 $ 4 8.7\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nTotal intrinsic value exercised (in thousands) $ 2,040 $ 3,054 $ 2,842\nTotal fair value that vested (in thousands) 1,106 1,681 1,742\nTime-Based Restricted Stock Units\nAramarks annual RSU grants for fiscal 2023 were awarded in November 2022, while Aramarks annual RSU grants for fiscal 2022 were awarded in November 2021 and Aramarks annual RSU grants for fiscal 2021 were awarded early in September 2020. For RSU grants awarded in fiscal 2023 or prior to September 2020, the RSU agreement provides that 25% of each grant will vest and be settled in shares on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date, subject to the participants continued employment with Aramark through each such anniversary. For RSU grants awarded during or subsequent to September 2020 and prior to fiscal 2023, the RSU agreement provides that 33% of each grant will vest and be settled in shares on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to the participants continued employment with Aramark through each such anniversary. The grant-date fair value of RSUs is based on the fair value of Aramarks common stock. Participants holding RSUs will receive the benefit of any dividends paid on shares in the form\nof additional RSUs. The unvested units are subject to forfeiture if employment is terminated other than due to death, disability or retirement, and the units are nontransferable while subject to forfeiture.\nRestricted Stock Units Units\n(000s) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 557 $ 35.94\nGranted 231 $ 40.23\nVested (266) $ 35.29\nForfeited (106) $ 36.38\nOutstanding at September 29, 2023 416 $ 38.56\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 29, 2023 September 30, 2022 October 1, 2021\nTotal fair value that vested (in thousands) $ 9,396 $ 7,084 $ 9,714\nPerformance Stock Units\nUnder the Aramark Stock Plan, Aramark is authorized to grant PSUs to its employees. A participant is eligible to become vested in a number of PSUs equal to a percentage, higher or lower, of the target number of PSUs granted based on the level of Aramarks achievement of the performance condition. During fiscal 2020, Aramark granted PSUs subject to the level of achievement of adjusted revenue growth, adjusted operating income growth, return on invested capital and a total shareholder return multiplier for the cumulative performance period of three years and the participants continued employment with Aramark. During fiscal 2022, Aramark granted PSUs subject to the level of achievement of adjusted revenue growth, adjusted operating income growth and a total shareholder return multiplier for the cumulative performance period of three years and the participants continued employment with Aramark. Aramark also granted PSUs during fiscal 2022 subject to the level of achievement of actual return on invested capital for the cumulative performance period of three years and the participants continued employment with Aramark. During fiscal 2023, Aramark granted PSUs subject to the level of achievement of adjusted revenue growth, cumulative adjusted earnings per share, return on invested capital and a total shareholder return multiplier for the cumulative performance period of three years and the participants continued employment with Aramark which was increased to four years for fiscal 2023 grants. Aramark is accounting for the fiscal 2023 grants as performance-based awards, with a market condition, valued utilizing the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model, which calculates multiple potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome. The grant-date fair value of the PSUs is based on the fair value of Aramarks common stock. No share-based compensation expense was recorded during fiscal 2022 or 2021 related to PSUs awards granted during fiscal 2020 as the performance targets for the awards were not met.\nPerformance Stock Units Units\n(000s) Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value\nOutstanding at September 30, 2022 97 $ 40.17\nGranted 56 $ 48.64\nVested - $ -\nForfeited (64) $ 44.97\nOutstanding at September 29, 2023 89 $ 44.53\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nOn February 2, 2021, Aramarks stockholders approved the Aramark 2021 ESPP. The ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10% of their eligible pay toward the quarterly purchase of Aramarks common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 85% of the lesser of the (i) fair market value per share of Aramarks common stock as determined on the purchase date or (ii) fair market value per share of Aramarks common stock as determined on the first trading day of the quarterly offering period. Purchases under the ESPP are made in March, June, September, and December. Aramark suspended its ESPP beginning in the second quarter of 2023.\nNOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nThe Company has capital and other purchase commitments of approximately $7.4 million at September 29, 2023, primarily in connection with commitments for the purchase of raw materials from vendors.\nFrom time to time, the Company and its subsidiaries are a party to various legal actions, proceedings and investigations involving claims incidental to the conduct of their business, including actions by customers, employees, government entities and third parties, including under federal, state, international, national, provincial and local employment laws, wage and hour laws, discrimination laws, immigration laws, human health and safety laws, import and export controls and customs laws, environmental laws, false claims or whistleblower statutes, tax codes, antitrust and competition laws, customer protection statutes, procurement regulations, intellectual property laws, supply chain laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, lobbying laws, motor carrier safety laws, data privacy and security laws, or alleging negligence and/or breaches of contractual and other obligations. Based on information currently available, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, established reserves and other resources, the Company does not believe that any such actions are likely to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, in the event of unexpected further developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the Companys business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is involved with environmental investigation and remediation activities at some of its currently and formerly owned sites (including sites which were previously owned and/or operated by businesses acquired by the Company). The Company initially provides for estimated costs of environmental-related activities relating to its past operations and third-party sites for which commitments or clean-up plans have been developed and when such costs can be reasonably estimated based on industry standards and professional judgment. These estimated costs, which are mostly undiscounted, are determined based on currently available facts regarding each site. If the reasonably estimable costs can only be identified as a range and no specific amount within that range can be determined more likely, the minimum of the range is used. The Company continuously assesses its potential liability for investigation and remediation-related activities and adjusts its environmental-related accruals as information becomes available upon which more accurate costs can be reasonably estimated. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company has $6.8 million and $6.3 million, respectively, recorded as liabilities within Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $17.3 million and $18.0 million, respectively, recorded as liabilities within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Companys Combined Balance Sheets.\nThe Company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The Company has identified certain conditional asset retirement obligations at various current and closed facilities. These obligations relate primarily to asbestos abatement, underground storage tank closures and restoration of leased properties to the original condition. Using investigative, remediation and disposal methods that are currently available to the Company, the estimated costs of these obligations were accrued. As of September 29, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company has $12.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively, recorded as liabilities within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Companys Combined Balance Sheets.\nOn May 13, 2022, Cake Love Co. (Cake Love) commenced a putative class action lawsuit against AmeriPride Services, LLC (AmeriPride), a subsidiary of Vestis, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota. The lawsuit was subsequently updated to add an additional named plaintiff, Q-Mark Manufacturing, Inc. (Q-Mark and, together with Cake Love, the Plaintiffs). Plaintiffs allege that the defendants increased certain pricing charged to members of the purported class without the proper notice required by service agreements between AmeriPride and members of the purported class and that AmeriPride breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of the purported class representing the amount of the allegedly improperly noticed price increases along with attorneys fees, interest and costs. The parties continue to engage in discovery. AmeriPride has moved for summary judgment related to Cake Love. The Company believes it has numerous defenses and intends to continue to vigorously defend the action. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this legal matter, nor can it predict whether any outcome will have a material adverse effect on the combined statements of income and/or combined statements of cash flows. Accordingly, the Company has made no provisions for this legal matter in the combined financial statements.\nNOTE 13. BUSINESS SEGMENTS:\nThe Company manages and evaluates its business activities based on geography and, as a result, determined that its United States and Canada businesses are its operating segments. The United States and Canada operating segments both provide a full range of uniform programs, managed restroom supply services and first-aid and safety products, as well as ancillary items such as floor mats, towels and linens. The Companys operating segments are also its reportable segments. Corporate includes administrative expenses not specifically allocated to an individual segment. The Company evaluates the performance of each operating segment based on several factors of which the primary financial measure is operating income. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1.\nCOVID-19 had a negative impact on revenue, operating income, capital expenditures and other identifiable assets for all segments in fiscal 2021.

On October 2, 2023, the Company began trading as an independent, publicly traded company under the stock symbol VSTS on the NYSE.\nIn connection with the Separation, the Company entered into or adopted several agreements that provide a framework for the relationship between the Company and Aramark, including, but not limited to the following:\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement - governs the rights and obligations of the parties regarding the\ndistribution following the completion of the separation, including the transfer of assets and assumption of liabilities, and establishes certain rights and obligations between the Company and Aramark following the Distribution, including procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.\nTransition Services Agreement - governs services between the Company and Aramark and their respective affiliates to provide each other on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, administrative, information technology and cybersecurity support services and certain finance, treasury, tax and governmental function services.

The directors designated as Class I directors have terms expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders following the separation, and will be up for re-election at that meeting for a two-year term to expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the separation. The directors designated as Class II directors have terms expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders following the separation and will be up for re-election at that meeting for a one-year term to expire at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the separation. The directors designated as Class III directors have terms expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the separation. Commencing with the third annual meeting of stockholders following the separation, directors will be elected annually and for a term of office to expire at the next annual meeting of stockholders, and our Board of Directors will thereafter no longer be divided into classes. Before our Board of Directors is declassified, it would take at least two annual meeting of stockholders to be held for any individual or group to gain control of our Board of Directors.\nLynn McKee and Doug Pertz are Class I directors, Tracy Jokinen, Mary Anne Whitney and Ena Williams are Class II directors and Richard Burke, Phillip Holloman and Kim Scott are Class III directors.\nDirector Independence\nProviding objective, independent judgment is at the core of our Board of Directors oversight function.

Decisions as to the compensation of those who currently serve as our executive officers were made by Aramark, as described in Item 11. Executive Compensation.\nCompensation Discussion and Analysis\nAs of September 29, 2023, we were a subsidiary of Aramark and were not yet an independent company and our compensation committee was not yet been formed. Following the Separation, we have our own executive officers and our own Compensation and Human Resources Committee of our Board of Directors (the Vestis Compensation Committee). The following individuals serve as executive officers of Vestis in the positions set forth below effective as of the Separation and are considered our named executive officers for our 2023 fiscal year:\nKim Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer\nRick Dillon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nTimothy Donovan, Executive Vice President, Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel\nAngela Kervin, Executive Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer\nGrant Shih, Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer\nThe following sections of this Compensation Discussion and Analysis describe Aramarks executive compensation philosophy, the executive compensation program elements applicable to the Aramark named executive officers for fiscal 2023, and certain Aramark executive compensation plans, policies and practices, as well as certain aspects of our anticipated executive compensation arrangements following the Separation.\nFor purposes of this section, as a general matter, references to named executive officers or NEOs are to Aramarks named executive officers, and references to our named executive officers or Vestis NEOs refer to the executive officers of Vestis identified above. Since the Vestis named executive officers are not Aramark named executive officers, some of the information described herein is not directly applicable to the determinations of their historic compensation, and we have sought to note that where relevant.\nAramarks Executive Compensation Design\nAramarks executive compensation program is designed to retain and motivate executives and reward achievement of Aramarks performance goals aligned with value created for its shareholders. This is important because its performance is very much dependent on the talents, skills and engagement of its leadership team. Aramark generally measures its performance by growth in sales, earnings and free cash flow, and these metrics are reflected in its incentive plans. By focusing on these performance metrics, Aramark believes its incentive plans will drive broader shareholder value creation. Aramark ties its executives long-term interests with those of its shareholders through equity compensation awards in respect of Aramark common stock. The equity is typically delivered in the form of performance stock units (PSUs), stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). PSUs typically have made up 50% of the grant to provide value only to the extent long-term performance objectives are achieved. Aramarks executives are also measured by their individual contributions to Aramarks success, and this is a consideration in base salary adjustment decisions. We expect to follow the design of Aramarks executive compensation program as of immediately following the Separation although the make-up of the mix of long-term incentive equity awards will differ where all Vestis executive officers will receive the annual long-term incentive equity awards in the form and mix of PSUs (50%), stock options (25%) and RSUs (25%) for fiscal 2024.\nAramarks Executive Compensation Principles and Operating Framework\nAramarks executive compensation program is overseen by its Compensation and Human Resources Committee, a committee of the Board of Directors of Aramark (the Aramark Compensation Committee) to support Aramarks business strategy. The following are the compensation principles and operating framework of its executive compensation program for fiscal 2023, which are the principles and operating framework of our compensation policy for our executive officers following the Separation:\nExecutive Compensation Guiding Principles\nPay for Performance\nShareholder Alignment\nAttract and Retain Key Talent\nThe vast majority of executive pay is at-risk and performance-based with metrics aligned to Aramarks strategy and long-term shareholder value creation. Aramarks approach strikes a balance between achieving both short- and long-term performance objectives.\nPrograms align executives interests with those of its shareholders. The majority of executive pay is provided through equity and linked to stock price. Aramark also maintains stock ownership guidelines for all named executive officers reinforced with conditional holding requirements for executives who have not met their guideline.\nAramark provides competitive pay and benefits to attract and retain talented, high-performing executives with specific skill sets and relevant experience to drive Aramarks business, create shareholder value and develop future leaders.\nGeneral Executive Compensation Operating Framework\nRisk Management\nGovernance Considerations\nAffordability/Shareholder Dilution\nAramark manages risk in incentive programs, while ensuring alignment between pay and performance, and with shareholder interests.\nAramark considers applicable requirements, as well as its corporate values and behavioral expectations, in designing its incentive structures and making compensation decisions.\nAramark conducts recurring reviews that balance goals and objectives of the program with fiscal soundness and shareholder dilution.\nExecutive Compensation Program and Practices Overview\nAramarks executive compensation program adheres to the following high governance standards, which we adhere to following the Separation.\nWhat We Do\nWhat We Dont Do\n\u00fc Risk Mitigation - Multiple metrics and measurement periods in incentives mitigate risk that executives will be motivated to pursue results related to one metric\n\u00fc Compensation Recoupment Policy - Robust clawback policy for pay in certain circumstances\n\u00fc Stock Ownership Guidelines - Aramarks NEOs and directors are subject to ownership guidelines with conditional holding requirements\n\u00fc Double-Trigger Change-in-Control Provisions - Both a change-in-control and termination are required for equity vesting acceleration and other benefits to apply\n\u00fc Annual Say-on-Pay Vote - Aramark seeks annual shareholder feedback on our executive pay program and directly engages with its shareholders on executive pay matters\n\u00fc Annual Evaluation - Aramark annually reviews its executive pay program to ensure it continues to align with market\n\u00fc Independent Advisor - Independent consultant provides advice directly to the Aramark Compensation Committee\n\u00fc Multiple LTI Vehicles - Use of PSUs, stock options, and RSUs provides a balanced approach that focuses executives on key financial achievements (PSUs), direct shareholder alignment (stock options), and retention and alignment with shareholders (RSUs)\nx No Guaranteed Bonuses - Aramarks annual bonus plans are performance-based and do not include any minimum payment levels or guarantees\nx No Executive Pensions or Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan\nx No Hedging and Restriction on Pledging - Aramark prohibits directors and employees from engaging in hedging and prohibits directors and named executive officers from pledging Aramark shares without specific pre-approval1\nx No Dividends on Unvested Equity Awards - Aramark does not pay dividends or dividend equivalents on equity awards prior to vesting\nx No Repricing or Exchange of Underwater Stock Option\nx No Tax Gross-Ups - Aramark does not provide gross-ups on benefits or perquisites in any employment agreements\nx No Recycling of Shares withheld for taxes\n__________________\n(1) There are certain limited exceptions to the prohibition on hedging and requirements with respect to pledging.\nDetailed Compensation Program Discussion\nCompensation Program Design\nOverview of Aramarks Compensation Components\nAs illustrated below, the principal components of Aramarks executive compensation program for fiscal 2023 are base salary, an annual cash incentive and long-term equity incentives, which will be the principal components of our executive compensation program following the Separation although the make-up of the mix of long-term incentive equity awards will differ where all Vestis executive officers will receive the annual long-term incentive equity awards in the form and mix of PSUs (50% with performance measures linked directly to Vestis strategic operating plan), stock options (25%) and RSUs (25%) which vest over three years for fiscal 2024.\nElement\nVehicle/Description\nLink to Aramark Strategy\nBase Salary\nCash\nBase salaries are determined based on scope of responsibility, experience and performance\nTo attract and compensate high-performing and experienced leaders at a competitive level based on market (both internal and external)\nAnnual Incentives\nCash\n100% evaluated on a formulaic basis relative to pre-established financial performance goals\nTo motivate and reward executives for achieving annual corporate, business, and function goals in key areas of financial performance\nFiscal 2023 Long-Term Incentives (LTI) granted in 2022\nPerformance Stock Units: CEO - 50%\nOther NEOs - 30%\nFocuses executives on the achievement of specific long-term performance goals directly aligned with Aramarks strategic operating plans.

Vests equally over four years.\nBase Salary\nBase salary reflects the value of the executive position and attributes the executive brings to the position, including tenure, experience, skill level and performance. The Vestis Compensation Committee will review annual base salaries for our executive officers each year in order to ensure alignment with current market levels. The Vestis Compensation Committee will take into account numerous factors when making its determination, including the executive officers experience relative to industry peers, competitive market data, time in his or her position, individual performance, future potential and leadership qualities. The 2023 annual base salary of each Vestis named executive officer is set forth in the table below.\nVestis Executive Officer\nJob Title\n2023 Salary\nKim Scott\nPresident, CEO\n$ 775,000\nRick Dillon(1)\nEVP, CFO\n$ 618,000\nTimothy Donovan(2)\nEVP, CLO, General Counsel\n$ 525,000\nAngela Kervin(3)\nEVP, CHRO\n$ 450,000\nGrant Shih\nEVP, CTO\n$ 380,000\n__________________\n(1) Reflects Mr. Dillons salary effective December 17, 2022, reflecting a merit increase of +3.0% over his previous annual base salary of $600,000.\n(2) Reflects Mr. Donovans salary effective December 17, 2022, reflecting a merit increase of +5.0% over his previous annual base salary of $500,000.\n(3) Reflects Ms. Kervins salary effective January 1, 2023, upon her promotion to Chief Human Resources Officer. Prior to that her annual base salary was $290,732 effective December 17, 2022 reflecting a merit increase of +6.0% over her previous annual base salary of $274,275.\nMs. Scotts annual base salary increased to $850,000 upon the Separation per the terms of the Scott Offer Letter (which is independent of further compensation actions taken by the Compensation Committee in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 in connection with its annual compensation review for all executive officers, pursuant to which her base salary was increased to $925,000 effective upon date of Separation).\nTarget Annual Incentives\nAramarks annual cash incentive is designed to drive and reward performance and is based on financial objectives established by the Aramark Compensation Committee at the beginning of each fiscal year. The incentive targets for each of Aramarks named executive officers are established based on market competitive data (see -Market Benchmarking) related to each executives role. Annual incentive targets as a percentage of base salary are provided in the table below. Actual earned payouts can vary from 0% to 200% of target.\nSimilar to Aramark, we will administer an annual incentive plan designed to reward the achievement of specific financial objectives results measured over one fiscal year (or, as applicable, a portion of a fiscal year). Each Vestis named executive officer is assigned an annual incentive target expressed as a percentage of base salary which is expected to be\nestablished based on market competitive data. The specific target bonus for each of our named executive officers for fiscal year 2023 under the Aramark annual incentive plan is listed in the table below.\nFiscal 2023\nVestis Executive Officer\nJob Title\nTarget\nKim Scott\nPresident, CEO\n100 %\nRick Dillon\nEVP, CFO\n75 %\nTimothy Donovan\nEVP, CLO and General Counsel\n60 %\nAngela Kervin(1)\nEVP, CHRO\n35 %/ 60 %\nGrant Shih(2)\nEVP, CTO\n50 %\n__________________\n(1) The amount of award for fiscal 2023 is subject to pro ration based on the effective date of Ms. Kervins promotion effective January 1, 2023. For periods prior to January 1, 2023, Ms. Kervins target bonus percentage of her annual base salary was 35%.\n(2) The amount of award for fiscal 2023 is subject to pro ration based on the effective date of Mr. Shihs employment of January 9, 2023.\nMs. Scotts target annual bonus increased to 125% of base salary upon the Separation and approval of Vestis Board of Directors, as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter.\nFiscal 2023 Annual Incentive Outcomes\nThe Aramark annual incentive plan for fiscal 2023 for the Vestis NEOs used the same performance metrics that were used for Aramark NEOs, except that they were measured against the performance of the Aramark Uniform Services business rather than Aramark as a whole. The performance metrics below are not reconcilable to Vestis GAAP results as they are based on the results of the Aramark Uniform Services business as a segment of Aramark and as reported by Aramark. These are not presented as a measure of financial performance of Vestis.\n__________________\n(1) Net New Sales is an internal Aramark statistical metric used to evaluate our new sales and retention performance. The calculation is defined as the annualized value of gross new business less the annualized value of lost business. It is a discrete metric that measures annualized revenue gained in year from new customers less annualized revenue lost following customer quits within year. It excludes the impact of increases and decreases in revenue with existing customers. For example, additional revenue generated from cross-selling to existing customers is excluded from the metric.\n(2) Adjusted Operating Income margin represents adjusted operating income as reported by Aramark divided by sales. Adjusted operating income represents operating income adjusted for amortization expense of acquired intangibles; share-based compensation expense; severance and other charges; separation related charges; and gain, losses, settlements and other items impacting comparability.\n(3) Free Cash Flow represents net cash provided by operating activities as reported by Aramark less net purchases of property and equipment and other.\nIn November 2023, the Vestis Compensation Committee reviewed the actual results of our business as a segment of Aramark versus the performance metrics established by Aramark for our named executive officers. Based on this review, the Vestis Compensation Committee determined that the Vestis executive officers earned annual incentive award payouts for fiscal 2023 as set forth in the table below.\nVestis Executive Officer\nJob Title\nBase\nSalary\nx\nTarget Award %\nx\nActual Earned %\n=\nActual Payout (3)\nKim Scott\nPresident, CEO\n$ 775,000 100 % 81.0 % $ 627,792\nRick Dillon\nEVP, CFO\n$ 618,000 75 % 81.0 % $ 375,460\nTimothy Donovan\nEVP, CLO and General Counsel\n$ 525,000 60 % 81.0 % $ 255,167\nAngela Kervin(1)\nEVP, CHRO\n$ 450,000 35 %/60 % 81.0 % $ 184,363\nGrant Shih(2)\nEVP, CTO\n$ 380,000 50 % 81.0 % $ 115,116\n__________________\n(1) The amount of the award was prorated based on Ms. Kervins promotion effective January 1, 2023. Ms. Kervins annual base salary was $450,000 effective January 1, 2023. Prior to that her base salary was $290,732 effective December 17, 2022 reflecting a merit increase of +6.0% over her previous annual base salary of $274,275.\n(2) The amount of the award was prorated at 74.8% based on the effective date of Mr. Shihs employment of January 9, 2023.\n(3) The recalculation of the actual payout compared to the actual payout presented in the table above may vary slightly due to rounding.\nFiscal 2024 Annual Incentive Performance Metrics and Weightings\nThe Vestis annual incentive plan for fiscal 2024 will be based on Adjusted EBITDA dollars (50%) and Revenue Growth dollars (50%). EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization of intangible assets and stock compensation expense. Adjustments will be made for items not indicative of normal operating performance. Revenue growth is defined as revenues before the impact of foreign currency or acquisitions. This change in revenue growth metric from the Aramark metric of Net New to revenue growth dollars allows us to accurately reflect our growth performance inclusive of revenue generated from cross selling to existing customers.\nLong Term Incentives (LTI)\nLong Term Incentive Grant Targets\nAramarks long-term equity incentive plan is designed to focus executives on the achievement of specific long-term performance goals directly aligned with Aramarks strategic operating plans. We intend that our long-term equity plan will also be designed to align the interests of our executives with the achievement of long-term growth and performance following the Separation.\nFor fiscal year 2023 the Aramark Compensation Committee approved LTI awards composed of a mix of PSUs, RSUs and options to provide a long-term incentive component to the pay mix of its NEOs. The total annual grants by Aramark to the Vestis named executive officers during fiscal year 2023 are as follows:\nVestis Executive Officer\nJob Title\nFiscal 2023 Grant\n(November 17, 2022)\nLTI Grant Value\nKim Scott\nPresident, CEO\n$ 1,750,000\nRick Dillon\nEVP, CFO\n$ 850,000\nTimothy Donovan\nEVP, CLO and General Counsel\n$ 600,000\nAngela Kervin\nEVP, CHRO\n$ 135,000\nMs. Scotts annual long-term incentive equity award target was increased after the Separation and approval by Vestis Board of Directors, as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter, to a target value of at least $3,600,000. Further, as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter, the Vestis Board of Directors approved a one-time long-term incentive equity award for Ms. Scott with a value of $1,850,000 granted in the form of Vestis equity awards on October 2, 2023 in connection with the Separation, representing a make whole annual equity grant as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter.\nFiscal 2023 Long Term Incentive Grant Allocations (granted in November 2022)\nFor Ms. Scott, her fiscal LTI award was comprised of 50% PSUs, where 60% of the resulting payout (if any) was to be earned based on three-year compound adjusted revenue growth performance (20%), three-year cumulative adjusted earnings per share performance (20%) and fiscal 2025 return on invested capital performance (20%), and where 40% of the resulting payout (if any) was to be earned based on Aramarks TSR performance relative to the fiscal 2023 performance peer group where the total number of PSUs earned would vest at the end of our fiscal 2026 performance year (representing a 4-year cliff vesting period). The remainder of the fiscal 2023 LTI award for Ms. Scott was comprised of time-vesting stock options (30%) and time-vesting RSUs (20%) where each vest evenly over a four year vesting period.\nFor our other named executive officers, the fiscal 2023 LTI award was comprised of PSUs (30%) with the same performance metrics and mix as outlined above for Ms. Scott, time-vesting stock options (30%) and time-vesting RSUs (40%).\nFiscal 2024 Long Term Incentive Grants\nThe Vestis Long-Term Incentive Plan for 2024 will be comprised of PSUs (50%), time vesting RSU (25%), and time vesting Stock Options (25%). The PSUs will cover the three-year performance period including Fiscal Years\n2024-2026. The resulting payout, subject to performance targets being met, will be based on Cumulative Adjusted EBITDA dollars (50%), Cumulative Adjusted Free Cash Flow Conversion % (50%) and a modifier based on the total return to the Companys shareholders relative to the performance of the established peer group. The performance targets align with the long-term strategic goals for the company outlined during its September 2023 Analyst Day.\nThe LTI awards granted to our named executive officers were adjusted in connection with the Separation as described under Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Compensation Determinations Related to the Separation.\nHire, Promotion and Retention Equity Awards\nUpon their hire or promotion or to ensure their retention, our named executive officers received equity awards during fiscal year 2023 as follows:\nVestis Executive Officers\nJob Title\nReason for Grant\nGrant Date Value\nAward Type\nGrant Date\nAngela Kervin\nEVP, CHRO\nPromotion\n$ 365,000 Stock options, RSUs, PSUs\n3/1/2023\nTreatment of Long Term Incentive Grants upon the Separation\nThe treatment of Aramark PSUs, stock options and RSUs in connection with the Separation is summarized in this Annual Report under the heading Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation in Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nOther Compensation Components\nThe Aramark Compensation Committee provides additional benefits to the Aramark named executive officers that are customary for executives of similar rank to enable its executives to focus on its business and enhance their commitment to Aramark. It is currently expected that we will provide arrangements and programs similar to the following benefits:\nSeverance Arrangements and Payments upon a Change of Control: Similar to the Aramark NEOs, our named executive officers have employment agreements for indefinite periods terminable by either party, and in most cases our executives are entitled to certain payments and benefits in connection with certain terminations of employment. These provisions are intended to align executive and shareholder interests by enabling executives to consider corporate transactions that are in the best interests of the shareholders and our other constituents without concern over whether the transactions may jeopardize the executives own employment. These employment agreements are described below under Employment Agreements-Potential Post-Employment Benefits and Restrictive Covenants.\nEquity awards agreements with Aramarks named executive officers that provide for other payments in connection with a change of control contain a double trigger in order for the executive to receive compensation, meaning that awards will be accelerated only if the executives employment terminates within a certain period following the change of control. Equity award agreements granted by Aramark to our named executive officers are subject to these same terms.\nPerquisites: Aramark provides its named executive officers with other benefits that the Aramark Compensation Committee believes are reasonable and encourage retention and include those listed below. The costs of these benefits constitute a small percentage of a named executive officers total compensation. We offer many of these same benefits to the Vestis named executive officers:\npremiums paid on life insurance;\ndisability insurance;\nannual executive physical program;\nreceipt of a taxable car allowance and to the extent applicable, no cost parking at a garage near Aramark offices;\nfinancial planning services of up to $7,500 per fiscal year; and\nmatching charitable contributions of up to $10,000 per fiscal year.\nMarket Benchmarking\nThe Aramark compensation program is structured to enable Aramark to maintain its competitive position for key executive talent. To establish market competitive compensation practices for all named executive officers, the Aramark Compensation Committee refers, in part, to peer group data and survey data. The Aramark Compensation Committee worked with its independent consultant, Meridian Compensation Partners LLC (Meridian) to develop its Compensation Peer Group as well as a Performance Peer Group which is used in determining relative total shareholder return performance for the PSUs subjective to relative TSR performance. We will use benchmarking data and survey data with the guidance of independent consultants.\nSurvey Data Used by Aramark\nIn evaluating the compensation of certain of its named executive officers, the Aramark Compensation Committee also references survey data. In fiscal 2023, the Aramark Compensation Committee referred to peer group data and a subset of the Willis Towers Watson 2022 CDB General Industry Executive Compensation Survey that is size-adjusted through regression analysis based on its revenue, to perform a market check of the individual components of compensation and total compensation. Aramark does not consider any specific company included in the survey to be a material factor in the review of the compensation of its named executive officers. When making pay decisions, the Aramark Compensation Committee generally targets a reasonable range around the market median of survey data but retains flexibility to position employees above or below median based on employee experience, skill-set and performance.\nPerformance Peer Group for Total Shareholder Return for Aramark\nIn 2019, the Aramark Compensation Committee worked with Meridian to create a Performance Peer Group to be used in determining relative total shareholder return performance for the PSUs subjective to relative TSR performance. For the fiscal 2023 PSUs, the Performance Peer Group has remained relatively unchanged from fiscal 2020 and consists of companies in the Compensation Peer Group as well as a broader list of organizations that compete with us for investor capital and face similar business dynamics and challenges. The fiscal 2023 Performance Peer Group consists of the following companies:\n2022 and 2023 Performance Peer Group for Aramark\n(Relative TSR Peer Group for Fiscal 2022 - 2024 and Fiscal 2023 - 2025 PSUs)\n1.

Companies included as Vestis peers consist of 18 public companies in similar industries (uniforms, apparel, textile, restaurant and other diversified support services).\n1.

Urban Outfitters, Inc.\nCompensation Governance Policies\nIndependence of the Compensation Consultant\nThe Aramark Compensation Committees independent compensation consultant is selected and retained by the committee to advise on executive and director compensation and it is not intended that the consultant will do any other work for Aramark. The independent compensation consultant is Meridian. The Vestis Compensation Committee will also use the services of Meridian as its independent compensation consultant.\nRole of Independent Compensation Consultant\nThe Aramark Compensation Committees independent compensation consultant provides the Aramark Compensation Committee with general services related to executive and director compensation, and associated governance each year. These services include market intelligence, compensation trends, suggestions about compensation program design, general views on specific requests to the committee from management regarding compensation program design or decisions, the review of the peer group, benchmarking executive pay relative to the peer group and the broader market for executive talent, and an analysis of the risk profile of the compensation system. We will use an independent compensation consultant for similar services.\nRisk Mitigation Policies\nStock Ownership Guidelines\nTo align the interest of each executive officer with those of the shareholders, Vestis has implemented stock ownership guidelines for the Vestis executive officers as follows:\nAramark Named Executive Officer\nStock Ownership Guideline(1)\nCEO\n6x annual base salary\nCEO Direct Reports\n3x annual base salary\n__________________\n(1) Prior to attainment, absolute value is determined annually based on the then-current salary and the prior fiscal years average of month-end stock closing prices.\nFor purposes of determining compliance with the guidelines, shares included are limited to those that are (i) directly or indirectly beneficially owned (held indirectly, such as through family trusts or by immediate family members) or (ii) unvested restricted or deferred stock units. Therefore, unexercised vested and unvested stock options and unearned or unvested PSUs are not considered when determining compliance with the guidelines.\nThe guidelines require that the specified amount be attained by the fifth anniversary of the later of the Separation and the date the named executive officer became subject to their current ownership guideline. If a named executive officer has not attained the guideline amount by such date, one half of all shares delivered upon vesting of awards held by such named executive officer (net of withholding for tax obligations) must be retained until the guideline amount has been attained.\nAramark has a similar policy for its executive officers.\nProhibitions on Hedging and Restrictions on Pledging\nAramark and Vestis maintain a Securities Trading Policy that restricts pledging and prohibits its directors, officers and employees from engaging in hedging, speculative or other transactions that hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of its stock (including swaps, forwards, options, futures, collars, exchange funds and other derivative transactions or arrangements). This policy applies to all executive officers and directors subject to certain limited exceptions.\nClawback Policy\nThe Vestis Compensation Committee adopted an incentive compensation recoupment policy where the company can recover certain incentive compensation (annual incentive bonus and performance-based long term incentives) in the event of an accounting restatement that resulted in an overpayment of erroneously awarded compensation, regardless of whether the executives actions contributed to such accounting restatement. The new Vestis incentive compensation recoupment policy was adopted in accordance with the New York Stock Exchange listing rules and will apply to all executive officers and such other officers as designated by the Vestis Compensation Committee.\nThe Aramark Compensation Committee and the Aramark Board of Directors approved a robust incentive compensation recoupment, or clawback policy for executive officers and the direct reports of the Aramark chief executive officer in fiscal 2015.\nCompensation Risk Disclosure\nAs part of its responsibility to set appropriate executive compensation, the Aramark Compensation Committee annually considers balance in the compensation program and its impact on Aramarks risk management profile. The Vestis Compensation Committee will follow the same process following the Separation.\nSpecifically, in fiscal 2023, the Aramark Compensation Committee considered whether the mix of performance-based pay, the performance metrics and the degree of difficulty of the performance goals was sufficient to encourage management to strive for strong performance without encouraging risk taking beyond established risk parameters. The Aramark Compensation Committee also considered the input of its independent compensation consultant, Meridian, regarding the risk profile of the compensation program as well as various factors that would mitigate risks associated with Aramarks compensation program. These factors include: an effective balance between the cash and equity mix and short- and long-term focus; the use of multiple performance metrics; substantial stock ownership guidelines; a clawback policy; an anti-hedging policy; and independent committee oversight of the compensation programs.\nAfter discussing these matters, the Aramark Compensation Committee determined that in relation to fiscal 2023, Aramarks compensation program was appropriately structured and did not motivate individuals or groups to take risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Aramark. Following the Separation, the Vestis Compensation Committee is responsible for making such determination with respect to our compensation program.\nCompensation Decisions Related to the Separation\nIn-flight Performance Stock Units for fiscal years ended 2022 and 2023\nImmediately following the end of fiscal 2023, Aramark completed the spin-off of Vestis into a standalone public company. In order to ensure ongoing focus and alignment with Aramark's strategic goals, on October 13, 2023 pursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Incentive Plan, the Aramark Compensation Committee approved amendments to the performance goals and performance periods for the PSUs that were then outstanding. The performance measures applicable to each PSU were retained however the performance goals were adjusted to reflect pre and post Separation performance, using the original three-year strategic plans utilized to set the original targets.\nThe PSUs granted in fiscal 2022 were originally subject to performance targets based on Aramark performance for the three-year period ending September 27, 2024. To account for the Separation, 67% of these PSUs became subject to new adjusted performance targets and an adjusted performance period for the two-year period ended September 29, 2023, reflecting pre-Separation Aramark performance (Performance Period 1). The remaining 33% of these PSUs are subject to new adjusted performance targets for the one-year period ending September 27, 2024, reflecting performance of Vestis post-Separation (Performance Period 2). The Relative TSR modifier measurement period was shortened to align with Performance Period 1.\nIn November 2023, following the completion of Performance Period 1, the Aramark Compensation Committee determined that 117.7% (of target) for Ms. Scott, and 132.1% (of target) for Mr. Dillon, Mr. Donovan and Ms. Kervin, of the PSUs subject to Performance Period 1 for the NEOs were earned based upon the level of achievement attained relative to the amended targets for Performance Period 1. The PSUs earned with respect to Performance Period 1 for all the Vestis NEOs are now subject to time-based vesting and will vest on the original vesting date of September 27, 2024.\nIn addition to the removal of the Relative TSR modifier, new performance measures for Performance Period 2 were established by the Vestis Compensation Committee in November 2023 where such new targets will be based on Vestis results achieved for fiscal year 2024 that generally to align with Vestis strategic plan on a post-Separation basis.\nThe targets for the PSUs granted in fiscal 2023 which were subject to performance targets for the three-year period ending September 26, 2025, were also established by the Vestis Compensation Committee in November 2023 where such new targets will be based on Vestis results achieved for the two-year period ended October 3, 2025 that generally align with Vestis strategic plan on a post-Separation basis, in addition to the removal of the Relative TSR modifier. Any portion of the PSUs granted in fiscal 2023 that become earned, will vest on the original vesting date of October 2, 2026, subject to such executive officers' continued employment with the company.\nEquity Award Adjustments\nPursuant to the terms of the Third Amended and Restated 2013 Stock Incentive Plan and as a result of the Separation, all outstanding equity awards were adjusted to reflect the Separation. Aramark employees with outstanding equity awards at the time of the Separation continued to hold Aramark equity awards. Aramark equity awards held by Vestis employees at the time of the Separation were converted to Vestis equity awards. The outstanding equity awards were adjusted in a manner intended to preserve the intrinsic value as measured immediately before and immediately after the spin-off (and with respect to options, based on the aggregate spread value).\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION TABLES\nFISCAL 2023 SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE\nThe following tables, narratives and footnotes discuss the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and our next three most highly compensated executive officers serving at the end of fiscal year 2023, who are referred to as named executive officers (or NEOs):\nName and Principal Position Year Salary (1)\nBonus\nStock Awards (2)\nOption Awards (3)\nNon-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation (4)\nChange in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Earnings\nAll Other Compensation (5)\nTotal\nKim Scott\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n2023 $ 775,000 - $ 1,225,058 $ 525,014 $ 627,792 - $ 29,044 $ 3,181,908\nRick Dillon\nEVP and Chief Financial Officer\n2023 $ 613,846 - $ 595,043 $ 255,016 $ 375,460 - $ 269,170 $ 2,108,535\nTimothy Donovan\nEVP, Chief Legal Officer and General Counsel\n2023 $ 519,231 - $ 420,023 $ 180,010 $ 255,167 - $ 30,709 $ 1,405,140\nAngela Kervin\nEVP and Chief Human Resources Officer\n2023 $ 403,322 - $ 350,126 $ 150,014 $ 184,363 - $ 24,205 $ 1,112,030\nGrant Shih\nEVP and Chief Technology Officer\n2023 $ 270,385 $ 100,000 - - $ 115,116 - $ 12,631 $ 498,132\n__________________\n(1) Salary reflects actual salary paid to each NEO during fiscal year ending September 29, 2023.\n(2) Includes the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units granted in fiscal year 2023 computed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation.

The awards vest between 50% and 200% of target amount based on actual performance during the performance period, assuming the threshold performance requirement is met. Performance Stock Units are not eligible to vest prior to the end of the performance period, and vest provided that the NEO is still employed on such dates with certain exceptions (disability, retirement or death). See Potential Post-Employment Benefits. Performance stock units accrue dividend equivalent units that are delivered only upon vesting of the underlying shares and such dividend equivalent units are included in the table. See Item 11. Compensation Discussion and Analysis - Compensation Decisions Related to the Separation.\n(3) Restricted stock units granted during fiscal year 2023 are time vesting and which vest 25% at the end of each of the first four years from the date of grant. Restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2022 and prior years are also time vesting and which vests 33% at the end of each of the first three years subject to the NEO's continued employment with the company, with certain exceptions (disability, retirement or death). See Potential Post-Employment Benefits. The number of restricted stock units listed includes dividend equivalents accrued with respect to such award.\n(4) If a participants service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates due to retirement (as defined in each grant agreement as age 62 and 5 years of service), the installment of stock options and restricted stock units that are scheduled to vest on the next vesting date following such termination will immediately vest. With regards to performance stock units, a participant is eligible to vest in a portion of the award proportionate to the timing of the retirement and performance period (subject to achievement of the performance targets). In addition, if a participants service with the Company or any of its subsidiaries terminates due to retirement with notice (as defined in each grant agreement), the outstanding unvested equity awards will remain outstanding and eligible to vest on their original terms (with vesting of performance based equity incentives to remain subject to the achievement of the relevant performance conditions), without regard to a requirement that the executive remain in service with the Company. Additionally, in such event of retirement with notice, any vested stock options would remain exercisable for up to three years following the later of such retirement with notice or\napplicable vesting date. For information on the value of equity awards which would have vested upon retirement as of the end of fiscal 2023, see the table of estimated payments presented in Potential Post-Employment Benefits.\nOPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED FOR FISCAL 2023\nThe following table sets forth information regarding the number of shares acquired, and the value realized as a result of option exercises by NEOs and the value of any stock awards that vested for an NEO during fiscal year 2023. Prior to the Separation, our NEOs received equity awards denominated in shares of Aramark common stock. The share amounts set forth below reflect the original award denominated in shares of Aramark common stock and do not give effect to the conversion of the award in connection with the Separation.\nOption Awards\nStock Awards\nName\nNumber of Shares Acquired on Exercise\nValue Realized on Exercise (1)\nNumber of Shares Acquired on Vesting (2)(3)\nValue Realized On Vesting\nKim Scott\n26,883 $ 50,801 31,445 $ 790,982\nRick Dillon\n- - 2,336 $ 66,484\nTimothy Donovan\n- - 3,017 $ 82,737\nAngela Kervin\n- - 6,941 $ 205,368\nGrant Shih\n- - - -\n__________________\n(1) Value realized upon Exercise and Vesting of any stock options during the fiscal year is calculated based upon the closing price of Aramark common stock on the NYSE on the exercise date.\n(2) This column includes restricted stock units that have vested during the fiscal year. For restricted stock units the number of shares acquired on vesting includes dividend equivalents and reflects the number of Aramark restricted stock units prior to Separation.\n(3) For each NEO, shares actually delivered upon vesting of restricted stock units were net of amounts withheld related to taxes.\nPOTENTIAL POST EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS\nOur named executive officers may be eligible to receive certain benefits in the event their employment is terminated; (1) upon their retirement, disability or death, (2) by the company without cause (or by the executive in certain cases of good reason), or (3) in certain circumstances following a change of control. The amount of benefits will vary based on the reason for the termination and the provisions of each executive officers offer letter and employment agreement as outlined below.\nThe following sections present a discussion and calculations, as of September 29, 2023, of the estimated benefits each named executive officer would receive upon these various termination events. Although the calculations are intended to provide reasonable estimates of the potential benefits, they are based on numerous assumptions discussed in the footnotes to the table and may not represent the actual amount an executive would receive if a termination event were to occur.\nOffer Letters\nAramark has entered into offer letters with the Vestis named executive officers with respect to their positions with Vestis, which were assumed by Vestis and continue in effect following the Separation.\nKim Scott Offer Letter\nMs. Scott is party to an offer letter, dated September 20, 2021 (the Scott Offer Letter) with respect to her employment as President and Chief Executive Officer, Vestis, commencing October 10, 2021.

In addition, pursuant to the Donovan Offer Letter, Mr. Donovans new hire and subsequent equity awards will contain similar continued vesting and exercise terms as would apply upon retirement, if Mr. Donovans employment is terminated due to certain qualifying events including by us other than for cause, or by him for good reason.\nIn addition, the Donovan Offer Letter provides that Mr. Donovan will be entitled to enter into an employment agreement, the material terms of which are described below under the heading -Employment Agreements-Tim Donovan Employment Agreement.\nAngela Kervin Offer Letter\nMs. Kervin is party to an offer letter, dated December 22, 2022, with an effective date of January 1, 2023, with respect to her promotion to the position of Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, Vestis (the Kervin Offer Letter).

Following the Separation and subject to the approval of the Aramark Compensation Committee, the offer letters provide the equity awards will be converted into awards with respect to Vestis common stock in accordance with the terms of the Aramark equity plan and applicable tax rules. See Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation in Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nThe offer letters also provide for a car allowance of $1,100 per month, reimbursement of $7,500 for financial planning services, matching charitable contributions of up to $10,000 per fiscal year, four weeks of vacation, and with respect to Ms. Kervin and Mr. Dillon, coverage under the Aramark executive leadership relocation policy, which includes a tax gross-up for certain expenses.\nEmployment Agreements\nPotential Post-Employment Benefits and Restrictive Covenants\nEach of our executive officers has entered into an agreement with Aramark relating to employment and post-employment competition, which we refer to as employment agreements. The employment agreements entitle our executive officers to benefits upon certain terminations of employment and subject our executive officers to restrictive covenants pertaining to confidentiality, competitive activities, non-solicitation and assignment of certain works of authorship, inventions and intellectual property. The employment agreements were assigned by Aramark to Vestis effective as of the Separation.\nKim Scott Employment Agreement\nUnder Ms. Scotts employment agreement, dated September 20, 2021, if after the distribution Ms. Scotts employment is terminated (i) by us for any reason other than cause, (ii) by Ms. Scott for good reason, or (iii) by Ms. Scott due to a\ncompany breach termination (as such terms are defined in her employment agreement), then subject to the execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims, Ms. Scott will receive:\nseverance payments equal to her monthly base salary for 18 months made in the course of our normal payroll cycle (the applicable payment period, the severance pay period);\npro rata bonus provided for the year of termination at the time of the regular payment based on actual performance outcomes;\ntarget bonus multiplied by 1.5 payable in substantially equal installments in accordance with the normal payroll cycle over the severance pay period;\nparticipation in our basic medical and life insurance programs during the period over which she receives severance payments, with her share of premiums deducted from the severance payments;\ncontinuation of her monthly car allowance payments if provided at the time of termination, during the severance period;\nreimbursement for professional outplacement services incurred during the applicable severance pay period, in an amount not to exceed 10% of her base salary at the time of the termination; and\nvesting of outstanding equity awards as specified under the applicable plans and agreements, which would include the full vesting of her make-whole equity awards as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter.\nMs. Scotts employment agreement also contains a double trigger change of control termination provision. If, during the two-year period following a change of control (as defined in her employment agreement), her employment is terminated by us without cause (or her employment is terminated prior to such change of control either at the request of a party to the change of control transaction or otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of such change of control which subsequently occurs) or she resigns with good reason (as defined in her employment agreement), she will receive:\ncash severance benefits based on a multiple of two times her base salary and two times her target bonus payable over a two-year period according to our normal payroll cycle;\na lump sum payment equal to the portion of her target bonus attributable to the portion of the fiscal year served prior to termination, plus any earned but unpaid amounts;\ncontinued medical, life and disability insurance at our expense (for a two-year period following termination);\noutplacement counseling in an amount not to exceed 10% of her base salary;\ncontinued payment of her monthly car allowance payments, if provided at the time of termination, for a period of 24 months; and\nvesting of outstanding equity awards (or retirement plan benefits) as specified under the applicable plans and agreements, which would include the full vesting of her make-whole equity awards as set forth in the Scott Offer Letter.\nIf any payments in connection with a change of control would constitute excess parachute payments that are subject to excise taxes under Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, such payments will be subject to a reduction to avoid any such excise taxes that may be due, if such reduction results in Ms. Scott retaining a greater after-tax amount than if Ms. Scott received the full unreduced amount and paid all taxes (including the excise taxes) due.\nRick Dillon Employment Agreement\nUnder Mr. Dillons employment agreement, dated February 25, 2022, if after the distribution Mr. Dillons employment is terminated by us for any reason other than cause, then subject to the execution and nonrevocation of a release of claims, Mr. Dillion will receive:\nseverance payments equal to his monthly base salary for 12 months made in the course of our normal payroll cycle;\npro rata bonus provided for the year of termination at the time of the regular payment based on actual performance outcomes;\ntarget bonus payable in substantially equal installments in accordance with the normal payroll cycle over the severance pay period;\nparticipation in our basic medical and life insurance programs during the period over which he receives severance payments, with his share of premiums deducted from the severance payments;

The actual amount of compensation and benefits payable in any termination event can only be determined at the time of the termination of each NEOs employment with the company.\nPOTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE OF CONTROL\nName Retirement\nRetirement with Notice\nDeath\nDisability\nTermination for Cause\nTermination Without Cause (1)\nChange Of Control (2)\nKim Scott\n- - - - - - -\nCash Payment (Lump Sum) - - $ 1,000,000 - - $ 775,000 $ 775,000\nCash Payment (Over Time) - - - - - $ 2,325,000 $ 3,100,000\nAcceleration of Unvested Equity(3)\n- - $ 1,066,883 $ 1,066,883 - $ 683,339 $ 2,769,234\nBenefit Continuation(4)\n- - - - - $ 39,181 $ 76,467\nTotal - - $ 2,066,883 $ 1,066,883 - $ 3,822,520 $ 6,720,701\nRick Dillon\n- - - - - - -\nCash Payment (Lump Sum) - - $ 1,000,000 - - - -\nCash Payment (Over Time) - - - - - $ 1,081,500 -\nAcceleration of Unvested Equity(3)\n- - $ 180,958 $ 180,958 - - $ 760,001\nBenefit Continuation(4)\n- - - - - $ 29,722 -\nTotal - - $ 1,180,958 $ 180,958 - $ 1,111,222 $ 760,001\nTimothy Donovan\n- - - - - - -\nCash Payment (Lump Sum) - - $ 1,000,000 - - - -\nCash Payment (Over Time) - - - - - $ 840,000 -\nAcceleration of Unvested Equity(3)\n- - $ 132,872 $ 132,872 - - $ 672,812\nBenefit Continuation(4)\n- - - - - $ 29,722 -\nTotal - - $ 1,132,872 $ 132,872 - $ 869,722 $ 672,812\nAngela Kervin\n- - - - - - -\nCash Payment (Lump Sum) - - $ 1,000,000 - - - -\nCash Payment (Over Time) - - - - - $ 720,000 -\nAcceleration of Unvested Equity(3)\n- - $ 116,493 $ 116,493 - - $ 826,774\nBenefit Continuation(4)\n- - - - - $ 26,121 -\nTotal - - $ 1,116,493 $ 116,493 - $ 746,121 $ 826,774\nGrant Shih\n- - - - - - -\nCash Payment (Lump Sum) - - $ 1,000,000 - - - -\nCash Payment (Over Time) - - - - - $ 570,000 -\nAcceleration of Unvested Equity(3)\n- - - - - - -\nBenefit Continuation(4)\n- - - - - $ 29,722 -\nTotal - - $ 1,000,000 - - $ 599,722 -\n__________________\n(1) Termination Without Cause means termination without cause (as defined in employment arrangements, if applicable) in the absence of a change of control.\n(2) Cash payments and benefit continuation included in this column will only be paid to or received by the named executive officers if they are terminated without cause (or, if applicable, resign for good reason) following a change of control (or they are terminated prior to such change of control either at the request of a party to the change of control transaction or otherwise in connection with or in anticipation of such change of control which subsequently occurs.). Equity awards granted under the Aramark 2013 Stock Plan vest if the NEO is terminated without cause (or, if applicable, resigns for good reason) during the two-year period following the change of control. With regard to performance-based equity, valuation is based on achieving target performance.\n(3) Represents acceleration of unvested stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock units that would vest upon the occurrence of the specified event. Calculations are based upon the closing price of Aramark common stock on the NYSE as of September 29, 2023 (representing the pre-Separation Aramark closing price of $34.70).\n(4) Benefit continuation assumes the cost of benefits in connection with termination of employment for Health Insurance Premiums, Dental Insurance Premiums, Vision Insurance Premiums based on insurance premium rates in effect at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nDirector Compensation\nDuring 2022 and 2023, we were not an independent public company and did not pay any compensation to non-employee directors. Vestis non-employee director compensation program is in effect as of immediately following the Separation and is set forth below. Vestis non-employee director compensation program will be subject to review and modification by Vestis Board of Directors or a committee thereof from time to time.\nAnnual Retainer\nVestis non-employee director compensation program provides the following: (1) an annual cash retainer equal to $100,000 paid in four equal installments quarterly, in arrears; and (2) an annual grant of Vestis equity with a grant date value equal to $140,000, which is generally granted on the date of Vestis annual meeting of stockholders for so long as the\ndirector remains a member of Vestis Board of Directors. On October 2, 2023, directors received an initial pro-rated grant in respect of the period following the Separation and ending on January 31, 2024 and will receive an annual grant on February 1, 2024. Annual grants will vest subject to the directors continued service on Vestis Board of Directors on the date of the subsequent annual meeting of stockholders (with the initial pro-rated annual grant to vest on January 31, 2024). For the pro-rated grant made on October 2, 2023, and the shares in respect thereof are generally deliverable on the first day of the seventh month following the date the non-employee director ceases to serve on Vestis Board of Directors. We expect that, with respect to future annual grants, directors will be entitled to elected whether to take delivery of the shares upon vesting or to defer delivery pursuant to our newly established deferred compensation plan.\nSpecial Grant\nIn consideration for the independent advisory services provided by certain directors through the date of the Separation, upon the Separation such directors received a special grant of deferred stock units on October 2, 2023 with a grant date value equal to an amount determined by multiplying (1) the number of full and partial months from and including January 2023 to and including the month in which the Separation occurred by (2) $20,000, which deferred stock units were fully vested on the date of grant and are deliverable on the first day of the seventh month following the date the non-employee director ceases to serve on Vestis Board of Directors.\nDIRECTOR COMPENSATION TABLE FOR FISCAL 2023\nThe following table details the compensation paid to our nonemployee directors for fiscal year 2023:\nName Fees Earned or Paid in Cash Fees Earned or Paid in Stock (1)\nStock Awards\nAll Other Compensation Total\nPhillip Holloman - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\nDoug Pertz - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\nRichard Burke - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\nTracy Jokinen - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\nLynne McKee - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\nMary Anne Whitney - $ 40,000 - - $ 40,000\nEna Williams - $ 180,000 - - $ 180,000\n__________________\n(1) Includes Advisory Board Director Fees of $20,000 per month earned during the service period prior to the Spin-off (representing 9 months of service for Mr. Holloman, Pertz, Burke and Mrs. McKee and Williams, and representing 2 months of service for Mrs. Whitney). Pre-Separation Director Fees were paid in the form of Vestis Deferred Stock Units Granted on October 2, 2023 and are immediately vested upon the grant date.\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nOn November 28, 2023, the Vestis Compensation Committee adopted the Vestis Deferred Compensation Plan (the Deferred Compensation Plan). Under the Deferred Compensation Plan, non-employee directors will be able to elect to defer all or a portion of their annual retainer, chair fees and annual equity compensation payable to the director pursuant to restricted stock unit awards or similar awards under the Companys 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Similarly, eligible executives (including the Companys executive officers) may elect to defer all or a portion of their base salaries, annual incentives and equity compensation attributable to performance stock units and restricted stock units award(s) or similar awards under the LTIP. Such deferral elections must be made in advance in accordance with rules and procedures determined under the Deferred Compensation Plan and will include an election as to the time and form of payment of deferred amounts.\nAll amounts deferred under the Plan will be credited to either an equity account, which is denominated in shares of Company common stock, or a deferral account, which is denominated in US dollars. Under the Plan, deferrals of remuneration and compensation payable in cash are credited to deferral accounts and deferrals of equity-based awards are credited to equity accounts. Equity accounts are also credited with additional stock units (dividend equivalent units) in the event that dividends are paid with respect to shares of the Companys common stock. Transfers between deferral accounts and equity accounts are not permitted.\nAmounts credited to equity accounts (including dividend equivalent units related to deferred equity awards) are subject to the same vesting conditions as would have applied had the stock-based award not been deferred. Deferral accounts under the Plan are credited with earnings at a rate equal to Moodys Corporate Baa Bond Index rate as of the month of October for the year preceding the year to which the rate applies or based on such other hypothetical investments\ndetermined by the administrator from time to time. Amounts payable from a participants deferral account will be settled in cash. Amounts credited to equity accounts are settled in shares of the Companys common stock from the shares reserved under the LTIP (with cash being issued for any fractional share amounts distributed).\nThe right of each participant to receive payments or distributions under the Plan is that of a general, unsecured creditor of the Company. The Deferred Compensation Plan is effective as of January 1, 2024 and will apply to deferrals of remuneration and compensation otherwise payable for periods after (or equity-based awards granted after) December 31, 2023.\nVestis Corporation 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nThe material terms of the Vestis Corporation 2023 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the Plan) are summarized below.\nThe purpose of the Plan is to provide a means through which Vestis and its affiliates may attract and retain key personnel and to provide a means whereby Vestis directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors can acquire and maintain an equity interest in Vestis, or be paid incentive compensation, which may (but need not) be measured by reference to the value of Vestis common stock, thereby strengthening their commitment to Vestis welfare and aligning their interests with those of Vestis stockholders. Employees and directors of Vestis or any of its affiliates as well as certain consultants or advisors to Vestis or any of its affiliates are eligible to participate in the Plan (collectively, Eligible Persons). The Plan is administered by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee.\nThe types of awards that may be granted under the Plan are incentive stock options (ISOs), nonqualified stock options (NQOs, which together with ISOs are referred to collectively as Options), stock appreciation rights (SARs), and full value awards (including restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units) (Full Value Awards).\nThe Plan provides that the total number of shares of Vestis common stock that may be issued under the Plan is the sum of (a) the number of shares of Vestis common stock subject to awards that have been converted from Aramark awards, including, in the case of performance-based awards, the number of shares that may be delivered if the maximum performance metrics are satisfied, and (b) 15 million, in each case, subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Plan.\nThe Plan provides that the sum of any cash compensation or other compensation and the value of any awards granted to an outside director as compensation for services as a director during the period beginning on the date of one regular annual meeting of Vestis shareholders until the date of the next regular annual meeting of Vestis stockholders may not exceed $1 million. The Vestis Committee may make exceptions to this limit for individual directors in exceptional circumstances.\nThe exercise price for any outstanding Option or the strike price of a SAR may not be decreased after the date of grant.\nIn the event of a corporate transaction involving Vestis (including, without limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination or exchange of shares), the Compensation and Human Resources Committee shall adjust the terms of the Plan and awards to preserve the benefits or potential benefits of the Plan or the awards as determined in its sole discretion.\nUnless otherwise specifically prohibited under applicable laws or by the rules and regulations of any applicable governmental agencies or national securities exchange, or unless otherwise provided by the Vestis Compensation and Human Resources Committee in the award agreement, in a participants employment agreement or other individual service agreement with Vestis or an affiliate in an individual severance or other similar agreement between Vestis (or an affiliate) and a participant, the following rules will apply to awards under the Plan in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Plan):\n(a) Upon a Change of Control, (i) any performance conditions applicable to Full Value Awards outstanding under the Plan as of the date of the Change of Control will be deemed to have been achieved at the target level of performance for the performance period in effect on the date of the Change of Control and such awards shall thereafter not be subject to any performance conditions, unless the awards will be continued after the Change of Control and the Vestis Committee reasonably determines that, from and after the Change of Control, performance applicable to Full Value Awards can be determined with respect to the performance period in effect on the date of the Change of Control on substantially the same basis as applied immediately prior to the Change of Control.\n(b) If, upon a Change of Control, then-outstanding awards under the Plan are continued under the Plan or are assumed by a successor to Vestis and/or awards in other shares or securities are substituted for then-outstanding awards under the Plan (which continued, assumed, and/or substituted awards are referred to collectively herein as Replacement Awards), then: (i) each participants Replacement Awards will continue in accordance with their terms; and (ii) with respect to any participant whose termination date has not occurred as of the Change of Control, if the participants termination date occurs by reason of a covered terminated within two years following the Change of Control, then (1) all of the participants outstanding Replacement Awards that are Full Value Awards will be fully vested upon his or her termination date and generally will be settled or paid within 30 days after the termination date, and (2) in the case of any Replacement Awards that are Options or SARs, the Replacement Award will be fully vested and exercisable as of the termination date and the exercise period will extend for 24 months following the termination date or, if earlier, the expiration date of the Option or SAR.\n(c)If, upon a Change of Control, awards are not continued or replaced, all then-outstanding awards will become fully vested upon the Change of Control and will be canceled in exchange for a cash payment or other consideration generally provided to stockholders in the Change of Control equal to the then-current value of the award, determined as though the award was fully vested and exercisable (as applicable) and any restrictions applicable to such award had lapsed immediately prior to the Change of Control; provided, however, that in the case of an Option or SAR, the amount of such payment may be equal to the excess of the aggregate per share consideration to be paid with respect to the cancellation of the Option or SAR over the aggregate exercise price of the Option or SAR (but not less than zero). For the avoidance of doubt, in the case of any Option or SAR with an exercise price that is greater than the per share consideration to be paid with respect to the cancellation of the Option or SAR, the consideration to be paid with respect to cancellation of the Option or SAR may be zero.\nAny awards under the Plan and any shares of Vestis common stock or cash issued pursuant to the Plan shall be subject to Vestis compensation recovery, clawback, and recoupment policies as in effect from time to time.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nAgreements with Aramark\nPrior to the Separation, we were wholly owned by Aramark. Following the Separation, we and Aramark operate separately, each as an independent public company.\nPrior to the Separation, we and Aramark entered into the separation and distribution agreement. We also entered into various other agreements that outline the terms and conditions of the separation and distribution and provide a framework for our relationship with Aramark after the Separation, such as the transition services agreement, tax matters agreement and the employee matters agreement.\nThe summaries of each of the agreements listed above are qualified in their entireties by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, forms of which are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report.\nSeparation and Distribution Agreement\nTransfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities\nThe separation and distribution agreement identifies the assets transferred, the liabilities assumed and the contracts transferred to each of us and Aramark as part of the Separation of us from Aramark into an independent, publicly traded company, and provides for when and how these transfers and assumptions occur. In particular, the separation and distribution agreement provides that, among other things, subject to the terms and conditions contained therein:\ncertain assets related to us, which this Annual Report refers to as the Vestis Assets, are retained by or transferred to us or one of our subsidiaries. Subject to certain exceptions, assets that are exclusively related to us are Vestis Assets;\ncertain liabilities related to us or the Vestis Assets, which this Annual Report refers to as the Vestis Liabilities, are retained by or transferred to us. Subject to certain exceptions, liabilities that arise out of or are resulting from us, including liabilities of various legal entities that are subsidiaries of us following the separation, are Vestis Liabilities; and\nall of the assets and liabilities (including whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than the Vestis Assets and the Vestis Liabilities (such assets and liabilities, other than the Vestis Assets and the Vestis Liabilities, this Annual Report refers to as the Aramark Assets and Aramark Liabilities, respectively) are retained by or transferred to Aramark.\nExcept as expressly set forth in the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement, neither us nor Aramark made any representation or warranty as to the assets, business or liabilities transferred or assumed as part of the Separation, as to any approvals or notifications required in connection with the transfers, as to the value of or the freedom from any security interests of any of the assets transferred, as to the absence or presence of any defenses or right of setoff or freedom from counterclaim with respect to any claim or other asset of either of us or Aramark, or as to the legal sufficiency of any document or instrument delivered to convey title to any asset or thing of value transferred in connection with the separation. All assets were transferred on an as is, where is basis, and the respective transferees bear the economic and legal risks that any conveyance prove to be insufficient to vest in the transferee good and marketable title, free and clear of all security interests, that any necessary consents or governmental approvals are not obtained, or that any requirements of law, agreements, security interests or judgments are not complied with.\nInformation in this Annual Report with respect to the assets and liabilities of the parties following the Separation is presented based on the allocation of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, unless the context otherwise requires. The separation and distribution agreement provides that in the event that the transfer of certain assets and liabilities (or a portion thereof) to us or Aramark, as applicable, did not occur prior to the Separation, then until such assets or liabilities (or a portion thereof) are able to be transferred, we or Aramark, as applicable, will hold such assets on behalf and for the benefit of the transferee, and will pay, perform and discharge such liabilities, for which the transferee will reimburse us or Aramark, as applicable, for all commercially reasonable payments made in connection with the performance and discharge of such liabilities.\nThe separation and distribution agreement also governs the rights and obligations of the parties regarding the distribution following the completion of the Separation. On the distribution date, Aramark distributed to its stockholders that hold Aramark common stock as of the record date for the distribution all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock (other than a number of shares of Vestis common stock (less than 1% of Vestis issued and outstanding shares of common stock upon the distribution) which were contributed to a donor advised fund in order to fund charitable contributions) on a pro rata basis on the basis of one Vestis share for every two Aramark shares held. Stockholders received cash in lieu of any fractional shares.\nClaims\nIn general, each party to the separation and distribution agreement assumes liability for all pending, threatened and unasserted legal matters arising from its own business or its assumed or retained liabilities and will indemnify the other party for any liability to the extent arising out of or resulting from such assumed or retained legal matters.\nReleases\nThe separation and distribution agreement provides that we and our affiliates release and discharge Aramark and its affiliates from all liabilities assumed by us as part of the separation, from all acts and events occurring or failing to occur, and all conditions existing, on or before the distribution date arising from us, the Vestis Assets and the Vestis Liabilities\nand from all liabilities existing or arising in connection with the implementation of the separation, except as expressly set forth in the separation and distribution agreement. Aramark and its affiliates release and discharge us and our affiliates from all liabilities retained by Aramark and its affiliates as part of the separation, from all acts and events occurring or failing to occur, and all conditions existing, on or before the distribution date arising from the Aramark Business, the Aramark Assets and the Aramark Liabilities, and from all liabilities existing or arising in connection with the implementation of the separation, except as expressly set forth in the separation and distribution agreement.\nThese releases do not extend to obligations or liabilities under any agreements between the parties that remain in effect following the separation, which agreements include the separation and distribution agreement and the other agreements described Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.\nIndemnification\nIn the separation and distribution agreement, we agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Aramark, each of their respective affiliates, and each of Aramarks affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents, from and against all liabilities arising out of or resulting from:\nthe Vestis Liabilities;\nOur failure or the failure of any other person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any of the Vestis Liabilities, in accordance with their respective terms, whether prior to, at or after the distribution;\nexcept to the extent arising from an Aramark Liability, any guarantee, indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding for the benefit of us by Aramark that survives the distribution;\nany breach by us of the separation and distribution agreement or any of the ancillary agreements; and\nany untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact in the Form 10-12B/A filed with the SEC on September 6, 2023 or other related disclosure document (as amended or supplemented), except for any such statements or omissions made explicitly in Aramarks name.\nAramark agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless us, each of our affiliates and each of our affiliates directors, officers, employees and agents from and against all liabilities arising out of or resulting from:\nthe Aramark Liabilities;\nthe failure of Aramark or any other person to pay, perform or otherwise promptly discharge any of the Aramark Liabilities in accordance with their respective terms whether prior to, at or after the distribution;\nexcept to the extent arising from a Vestis Liability, any guarantee, indemnification or contribution obligation, surety bond or other credit support agreement, arrangement, commitment or understanding for the benefit of Aramark by us that survives the distribution;\nany breach by Aramark of the separation and distribution agreement or any of the ancillary agreements; and\nany untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission of a material fact made explicitly in Aramarks name in the Form 10-12B/A filed with the SEC on September 6, 2023 or other related disclosure document (as amended or supplemented).\nThe separation and distribution agreement also establishes procedures with respect to claims subject to indemnification and related matters.\nIndemnification with respect to taxes, and the procedures related thereto, are governed by the tax matters agreement.\nInsurance\nThe separation and distribution agreement provides for the allocation between the parties of rights and obligations under existing insurance policies with respect to occurrences prior to the distribution and sets forth procedures for the administration of insured claims and related matters.\nFurther Assurances\nIn addition to the actions specifically provided for in the separation and distribution agreement, except as otherwise set forth therein or in any ancillary agreement, we and Aramark agreed in the separation and distribution agreement to use reasonable best efforts, prior to, on and after the distribution date, to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws, regulations and agreements to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by the separation and distribution agreement and the ancillary agreements.\nDispute Resolution\nThe separation and distribution agreement contains provisions that govern, except as otherwise provided in any ancillary agreement, the resolution of disputes, controversies or claims that may arise between us and Aramark related to the separation or distribution and that are unable to be resolved through good faith discussions between us and Aramark. If such efforts are not successful, one of the parties in dispute may submit the dispute, controversy or claim to nonbinding mediation and if such efforts are still not successful, either party may (i) commence binding arbitration if the amount in dispute is less than $100,000,000 and the dispute does not involve primarily non-monetary relief or (ii) commence litigation if the amount in dispute totals $100,000,000 or more or involves primarily non-monetary relief, in each case subject to or as otherwise set forth in the provisions of the separation and distribution agreement.\nExpenses\nExcept as expressly set forth in the separation and distribution agreement or in any ancillary agreement, the party incurring the expense will be responsible for all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the separation prior to the distribution date.\nOther Matters\nOther matters governed by the separation and distribution agreement include, among others, approvals and notifications of transfer, termination of intercompany agreements, shared contracts, financial information certifications, transition committee provisions, confidentiality, access to and provision of records, privacy and data protection, production of witnesses, privileged matters and financing arrangements.\nAmendment and Termination\nThe separation and distribution agreement provides that no provision of the separation and distribution agreement or any ancillary agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or modified by a party without the written consent of the party against whom it is sought to enforce such waiver, amendment, supplement or modification.\nAfter the distribution date, the separation and distribution agreement may not be terminated, except by an agreement in writing signed by both us and Aramark.\nTransition Services Agreement\nWe and Aramark entered into a transition services agreement in connection with the separation pursuant to which we and Aramark and our respective affiliates will provide each other, on an interim, transitional basis, various services, including, but not limited to, administrative, information technology and cybersecurity support services and certain finance, treasury, tax and governmental function services. The services will be provided in a manner consistent with past practices or otherwise how such services were currently performed within Aramark. The pricing is expected to be on a cost or cost-plus basis (based on actual costs incurred by the party rendering the services plus a fixed percentage) or an hourly rate. The party receiving each transition service will be provided with reasonable information that supports the charges for such transition service by the party providing the service.\nThe services commenced on the distribution date and terminate no later than 24 months following the distribution date. The receiving party may terminate any services by giving prior written notice to the provider of such services and paying any applicable wind-down charges.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the liabilities of each party providing services under the transition services agreement will generally be limited to the aggregate charges actually paid to such party by the other party in the prior 12 months (or such shorter period if 12 months have not elapsed) pursuant to the transition services agreement. The transition services agreement also provide that the provider of a service will not be liable to the recipient of such service for any lost profits, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, remote, speculative or similar damages.\nTax Matters Agreement\nIn connection with the separation, we and Aramark entered into a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights, responsibilities and obligations with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, the control of audits and other tax proceedings and other matters regarding taxes.\nThe tax matters agreement provides special rules that allocate tax liabilities in the event the distribution or certain related transactions fail to qualify as transactions that are tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes (other than any cash that Aramark stockholders receive in lieu of fractional shares). Under the tax matters agreement, we will generally agree to indemnify Aramark and its affiliates against any and all tax-related liabilities incurred by them relating to the distribution and certain related transactions, to the extent caused by any representation by us being incorrect or an acquisition of our stock or assets or by any other action undertaken or failure to act by us. This indemnification will apply even if Aramark has permitted us to take an action that would otherwise have been prohibited under the tax-related covenants described below.\nPursuant to the tax matters agreement, we agreed to covenants that contain restrictions intended to preserve the tax-free status of the distribution and certain related transactions. We may take certain actions prohibited by these covenants only if we obtain and provide to Aramark an IRS ruling or an opinion from a U.S. tax counsel or accountant of recognized national standing, in each case satisfactory to Aramark in its sole and absolute discretion, to the effect that such action would not jeopardize the tax-free status of these transactions, or if we obtain prior written consent of Aramark, in its sole and absolute discretion, waiving such requirement. We are barred from taking any action, or failing to take any action, where such action or failure to act adversely affects or could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the tax-free status of these transactions, for all relevant time periods. During the period ending two years after the date of the distribution, the tax matters agreement will include specific restrictions on our (i) discontinuing the active conduct of our trade or business; (ii) issuance or sale of stock or other securities (including securities convertible into our stock, but excluding certain compensatory arrangements); (iii) liquidating or merging or consolidating with any other person; (iv) amending our certificate of incorporation (or other organizational documents) or taking any other action, whether through a stockholder vote or otherwise, affecting the voting rights of our common stock; (v) sales of assets outside the ordinary course of business; and (vi) entering into any other corporate transaction which would cause us to undergo a 50% or greater change in its stock ownership in the aggregate.\nEmployee Matters Agreement\nWe and Aramark entered into an employee matters agreement in connection with the Separation to allocate liabilities and responsibilities relating to employment matters, employee compensation and benefits plans and programs and other related matters. The employee matters agreement governs certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to former employees of Aramark and current employees and non-employee directors of each company.\nThe employee matters agreement provides that, unless otherwise specified, each party is responsible for liabilities associated with current and former employees of such party and its subsidiaries for purposes of post-separation compensation and benefits matters.\nThe employee matters agreement also governs the terms of equity-based awards granted by Aramark prior to\nthe separation. See Treatment of Equity-Based Compensation below.\nTreatment of Equity-Based Compensation\nIn connection with the separation and distribution, Aramark equity-based awards that are outstanding immediately prior to the Separation either remained awards in respect of Aramark common stock or converted into awards in respect of Vestis common stock, in each case adjusted to reflect the separation and distribution. Generally, equity awards held by an individual who is an employee of Vestis following the separation and distribution (a Vestis Employee) was converted into awards in respect of Vestis common stock, and awards held by employees who remained employed by Aramark following the separation and distribution and former employees as of immediately prior to the Separation remained awards in respect of Aramark common stock. Specifically, awards held by Vestis Employees are treated as follows:\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs). Each RSU award with respect to Aramark common stock held by a Vestis Employee was converted into an RSU award with respect to Vestis common stock, with the number of shares of Vestis common stock subject to each such converted RSU award adjusted in a manner intended to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value of the Aramark RSU award as measured immediately before and immediately after the separation and distribution, subject to rounding. Such adjusted Vestis RSU award is otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as those that applied to the Aramark RSU award immediately prior to the separation and distribution.\nPerformance Stock Units (PSUs). Each PSU award with respect to Aramark common stock held by a Vestis Employee was converted into a PSU award with respect to Vestis common stock, with the number of shares of Vestis common stock subject to each such converted PSU award adjusted in a manner intended to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value of the Aramark PSU award at maximum as measured immediately before and immediately after the separation and distribution, subject to rounding. Such adjusted Vestis PSU award is otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions as those that applied to the Aramark PSU award immediately prior to the separation and distribution, other than with respect to the performance goals, which (i) for the first two years of the 2022-2024 performance period, was measured and established by the Compensation Committee of the Aramark Board of Directors in November 2023 and (ii) for all other performance years and periods applicable to the Vestis PSUs, was established by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Vestis Board of Directors in November 2023.\nStock Options. Each stock option to acquire a share of Aramark common stock held by a Vestis Employee following the Separation was converted into an award of stock options with respect to Vestis common stock. The exercise price of, and number of shares subject to, each such converted stock option award was adjusted in a manner intended to preserve the aggregate intrinsic value of the Aramark stock option award as measured immediately before and immediately after the Separation, subject to rounding. Such adjusted stock option award is otherwise subject to the same terms and conditions that applied to the original Aramark award immediately prior to the Separation.\nOther Arrangements\nWe entered into the following commercial agreements with Aramark and its related entities.\nUniform and Workplace Supplies Rental Services Agreements\nWe entered into agreements under which we provide uniform and workplace supplies rental services to Aramark businesses in the United States.

In connection with the separation, we expect to enter into a master agreement that governs the direct sale of uniforms and workplace supplies to Aramark in the United States and Canada.\nAvendra Agreements\nWe entered into an agreement under which we provide uniform and workplace supplies rental services to third party members of Avendra, an Aramark owned GPO, in the United States.

We recorded associated revenues of $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively, and made associated payments to Aramark of $3,000, $7,000 and zero for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively, in connection with such agreement. We intend for this agreement to continue after the separation.\nWe purchase certain products directly from third-party suppliers on terms negotiated by Avendra. These purchases were made by us as an affiliate of Aramark. We entered into an agreement under which we will continue to purchase products from third-party suppliers as a member of Avendra after the separation. We made payments to such third-party suppliers of $5.9 million, $5.3 million and $5.0 million for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively, in connection with such purchases made through Avendra. After the separation, we will pay Aramark a nominal procurement fee in connection with purchases made under this agreement.\nBreakroom Services Agreements\nWe entered into agreements under which we receive coffee and other breakroom-related services and supplies from Aramark Refreshment Services, a subsidiary of Aramark. We made associated payments to Aramark of $0.5 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the fiscal years ended September 29, 2023, September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, respectively, in connection with such agreements. We intend for these agreements to continue after the separation.\nProcedures for Approval of Related Persons Transactions\nWe have a written Related Person Transaction Approval Policy regarding the review, approval and ratification of transactions between Vestis and related persons of Vestis. This policy applies to any transaction or series of transactions in which Vestis or a subsidiary is a participant, the amount involved exceeds $120,000 and a Related Person (as defined in Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K) has a direct or indirect material interest; provided, however, that our Board of Directors determined that certain transactions not required to be reported pursuant to Item 404(a) of SEC Regulation S-K are not considered to be transactions covered by the policy. Under the policy, a related person transaction must be reported to our General Counsel and be reviewed and approved or ratified by the Audit Committee (or disinterested members of our Board of Directors) in accordance with the terms of the policy, prior to the effectiveness or consummation of the transaction, whenever practicable. The Audit Committee reviews all relevant information available to it about the potential related person transaction. The Audit Committee, in its sole discretion, may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate on the company or the Related Person in connection with the approval of the Related Person transaction. Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (\"Deloitte\") has served as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm since 2023. Set forth below is information relating to the aggregate fees billed by Deloitte for professional services rendered for fiscal 2023 as well as a description of each fee category. Due to the timing of the spin-off from Aramark, the Vestis full Board was not appointed and its committees were not fully constituted during most of fiscal 2023. As a result, the majority of the services presented in the table below were approved by Aramarks audit committee.\nFiscal 2023\n(in thousands)\nAudit Fees(1)\n$ 3,244\nAudit-related Fees\n-\nTax Fees\n-\nAll Other Fees\n-\nTotal\n$ 3,244\n(1) Audit fees include fees and expenses for procedures related to the audit of Vestis Form 10-12B/A registration statement for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, the audit of annual financial statements for the year ended September 29, 2023, and the review of interim financials for the year to date periods ended December 30, 2022, December 31, 2021, June 30, 2023 and July 1, 2022.\nPolicy for the Pre-Approval of Audit and Permissible Non-Audit Services\nThe Audit Committee annually reviews and pre-approves the services that may be provided by the Companys independent registered public accounting firm without obtaining further specific pre-approval from the Audit Committee.
