    "content": "ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.\nTHE COMPANY\n(1) Form and year of organization\nAS-IP Tech, Inc. (formerly ASI Entertainment, Inc.) was formed on April 29, 1998 as a Delaware corporation. The Company has an authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value of $0.0001 per share (the Common Stock) and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. All shares of Common Stock have equal voting rights, are non-assessable, and have one vote per share. The executive offices of the Company are located at 1/15 Castles Drive, Torquay, Victoria, 3228, Australia. The United States offices of the Company are located at 100 Park Ave, 16th Floor, New York, NY 10017. The Companys telephone number is +1 424-888-2212.\nBUSINESS\n(1) Principal products or services and their markets;\nThe Companys intellectual property comprises two product lines called fflya and BizjetMobile.\nfflya\nThe Company has launched a new standard in inflight connectivity for Low-Cost Airlines (LCAs). The justification is simple, LCA passengers on a budget wont pay for Wi-Fi.\nThe Company achieved this via a proprietary disruptive technology, and business model which has been validated by thousands of passengers inflight, sending tens of thousands of messages on Wizz Air, and can be summarised as follows:\nTechnical\n\u00b7Core revenue platform is messaging. Communication and social contact drives everything.\n\u00b7AS-IPs flight proven free messaging service, Email, SMS and WhatsApp are embedded into an airlines existing booking app providing immediate access to a huge database without app marketing costs.\n\u00b7Eliminates the high costs associated with conventional Wi-Fi installations by creating an ultra-low-cost system and certification process, making it simple and economical for an airline to install.\n\u00b7Remotely controls the passenger app interface by flight, to engage and influence what passengers do and see while captive for 2-4 hours.\nBusiness Model\n\u00b7Use Free messaging as the draw card to create revenue from paid promotions in the app.\n\u00b7Implement a Social Network invite only approach to drive promotion before passengers fly. Flight tests confirm inviting friends to chat expands the database by a multiple of three.\n\u00b7Create virtual autonomous gateways that eliminate the conventional ISP facilities required by Wi-Fi systems.\nThe combination of these components is why after 16 years of inflight Wi-Fi on major airlines, multibillion dollar organisations such as, VIASAT/INMARSAT, UTELSAT and INTELSAT, are still unable to address the LCA market, including the new Starlink (Elon Musk) Wi-Fi service. On the ground, Starlink charges double the price of the incumbent networks. With inflight Wi-Fi already expensive, convincing airlines to switch to a faster service, with the control the incumbents have over the existing 8,000 major airlines aircraft will be a major challenge.\nRegardless, LCA passengers on a budget wont pay for Wi-Fi, and this is clearly understood by the major LCAs in Europe, Wizz Air, Ryanair, Jet2 and EasyJet, who operate over 1,400 aircraft, leaving this unique market opportunity to the Company and its proprietary technology.\nfflya provides airlines with a customized global inflight connectivity approach, based on the latest mobile App technology, narrowband satellite links and Bluetooth technology. The fflya platform reduces the installation, certification, and equipment costs by up to 95% compared to inflight broadband. In addition, it uses a cloud-based messaging platform capable of delivering real-time demographics.\nPassengers get:\n\u00b7Free SMS, WhatsApp and Email, and they dont need Wi-Fi to do it.\nAirlines get: -\n\u00b7A free satellite system.\n\u00b7New ancillary revenue streams.\n\u00b7A free real time, in-flight, fully verified credit card payment platform for In-app and EFTPOS that will eliminates card default problems.\n\u00b7Live feed telemetry data to enhance operation without data charges.\nThe Companys airline business model is based on a revenue sharing basis. Revenue is generated from embedded advertising, E-Commerce, live payment and destination sponsors.\nBizjetMobile\nBizjetMobile provides corporate jets with an alternative global inflight connectivity solution and is marketed under the brand names CrewX, CHiiMP and BizjetInternet. Each product is a mobile App which deliver a combination of highly optimized inflight text, chat, email, voice and internet for passengers and crew. The on-board network comprises an integrated satellite transceiver incorporating a Bluetooth hotspot that uses a set of algorithms and file management protocols that are custom built for aviation satellite networks. All communications are managed by a cloud-based gateway and report by user, flight, aircraft, file, and message type. As a result, passengers and crew receive unlimited inflight connectivity for a flat low monthly rate.\nThe Company has commissioned over 110 BizjetMobile systems since launch, operating across Asia Pacific, the Americas, Europe and the Middle East.\nMarkets\nfflyas target market is primarily low cost airlines (LCA) operating single aisle aircraft, for example, Boeing 737 and Airbus A320, that struggle to justify equipping their fleets with expensive Wi-Fi platforms as their business model targets passengers who are unwilling to pay. Of the 18,000 commercial airliners currently in operation, the B737/A320 series account for 13,000, of which approximately 75% are operated by regional airlines and LCAs. Single aisle aircraft represent 75% of the 35,000 new aircraft forecast to be delivered over the next 20 years.\nBizjetMobiles target market is the business aviation industry, specifically international corporate jets searching for an alternative low-cost global inflight connectivity solution or an-add on service to reduce their operational costs.\n(2) Distribution methods of the products or services;\nBizjetMobile distributors are related parties controlled by the Chapman family for the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific, and market the products on a commission basis.\nfflya marketing is controlled by the Chapman family in conjunction with agents, who will receive commissions from successful airline programs.\n(3) Status of any publicly announced new product or service;\nfflya - Following 3 months of flight trials, the Company announced a final agreement with Wizz Air to equip its UK fleet of nineteen A32X series aircraft. The first aircraft is equipped and in operation and further installations will commence in October. More recently, the Company successfully flight tested on Wizz Air, fflyas worlds first in flight Bluetooth payment solution incorporating live in-app credit card payment. To demonstrate the capability, the Company incorporated the Food and Boutique menu into the fflya messaging app, allowing an order to be placed, paid for by credit card and a receipt return to the app.\nThe fflya hardware, apps, gateway and support system are developed and supplied by a related party, ASiQ Pty Ltd (ASiQ), under the IP acquisition agreement and comprises, a router that connects passengers via Bluetooth, and a revolutionary window antenna system that connects to the Iridium satellite network. The Company contracts the service and hardware under commercial terms on a program-by-program basis.\nBizjetMobile - BizjetMobile LLC has announced the first corporate aircraft test bed was equipped with the Bizjetinternet Certus service, connecting via the new next generation Iridium satellites.\n(4) Competitive business conditions and the small business issuers competitive position in the industry and methods of competition;\nCompetition\nAirlines\nThe landscape of the airline Wi-Fi market has changed over the past 18 months, due to the impact of Covid. Intelsat acquired GOGOs airline business, Eutelsat acquired GEE, VIASAT and INMARSAT have proposed a merger.\nNew satellite operators, Starlink and OneWeb will compete with these companies in 2023, proposing a faster service, however they will face the same issue in that research shows that less than 10% of passengers are prepared to pay for Wi-Fi, plus the incumbents already control the market space with long term contracts. These new satellite networks cost up to 3-4 time more than the incumbents and their business models also rely on paying for Wi-Fi. As they operate in the identical K-band transmission frequencies, the equipment, installation and service cost will still be high. The net effect is similar to migration from 4G versus 5G. The user gets more data faster, but the price remains virtually the same.\nThe primary market for all these vendors is predominantly Tier 1 airlines and national flag carriers. These airlines provide business travellers with an adequate level of internet connectivity at a cost per flight similar to the daily rate of many 5-star hotels. In some cases, first and business class passengers receive this service free of charge.\nEquipment, installation and certification costs on Wi-Fi platforms are substantial and where possible, most airlines will exercise the option to have it factory installed on new aircraft. Approximately one third of the worlds airlines are equipped with inflight Wi-Fi, the majority of which are either in the U.S.A or are long haul wide body aircraft. Recent forecasts suggest that half of the worlds airlines will be fully equipped by 2025.\nThe challenge for the Company to compete, is to target the remaining market and create a platform and business model that eliminates the financial risk, generates new revenue, enhances the passenger experience, and removes the high operational/user costs associated with heavy and expensive Wi-Fi platforms.\nThe Company meets these challenges by targeting only the LCA market with a platform that is 95% lighter and cheaper and controlled by a proprietary gateway protocol that is up to 95% more efficient in delivering todays\nmobile App-based communications. This creates the ability to deliver a sponsored free texting service and generate new revenue from multiple inflight e-commerce opportunities. AS-IPs unique program targets LCAs which represent approximately 50% of the airline world, flying mainly Boeing B737 and Airbus A320 series aircraft and annually carry around 2 billion disconnected leisure passengers.\nfflyas Bluetooth technology leverages off new generation Iridium Low Earth Orbit satellites (LEOs). As LEOs operate 800 kilometres above the earth, latency is similar to a mobile phone network. Iridium Next LEOs offer a midband service so their low cost and low latency is perfectly suited to connect fflyas Bluetooth app-based technology.\nfflya is future proofed as it does not rely on the high cost of broadband or Wi-Fi to deliver its services. There are three key components that suit LCAs: Text, Telemetry and Credit Card Payment. All are delivered via short burst data which specifically suits the fflya Bluetooth and Iridium data platforms.\nThe Company believes it will be able to compete with other companies in the commercial airline field because of AS-IPs very low equipment costs, unique business model and little or no certification issues.\nBusiness Jet\nBizjetMobile is focused on the global market because of its use of satellite communications. In the USA, the business jet market is dominated GOGO Inc. (formally Aircell). GOGOs system connects passenger devices via Wi-Fi, having implemented an exclusive terrestrial wireless radio network across the domestic United States for transmission off the aircraft. GOGO has approximately 5,000+ domestic business jets connected to its system. A second company, SmartSky Networks, is building a similar USA terrestrial network to compete with GOGO.\nInternationally GOGO has equipped a further 4,737 aircraft with the Aircell (division of GOGO) Iridium satellite telephone systems. These are legacy satellite systems that cannot deliver Internet. The ChiiMP system enhances the Iridium telephone with messaging services and several BizjetMobile customers are connected via the Aircell Iridium systems. GOGO is also an INMARSAT reseller and has equipped several international aircraft with Wi-Fi. These systems are mainly installed at factory on larger jets and range in price from $150K - $650K. A second company VIASAT, also competes for the large jets with a similar $650K international solution.\nOther non US business jet competition.\nWhile there are multiple Iridium Telephone System resellers globally and some with basic Iridium messaging capability, none can match the capabilities of the BizjetMobile product range as BizjetMobile is the leader in inflight Bluetooth connectivity.\n(5) Sources and availability of raw materials and the names of principal suppliers; amortization, engineering, marketing and communication costs\nThe principal supplier of systems and services to the company is ASiQ, controlled by Ron Chapman, the President of the Company. As part of the original IP acquisition agreement, the Company was required to secure the service of Ron Chapman. It is Ron and ASIQs reputation in the aviation industry, that provides the credibility, drives the direction, and creates the programs for the Company. The Chapman family controls all marketing on behalf of the Company.\n(6) Dependence on one or a few major customers.\nThe Company will be dependent on its distribution network to market the product to generate income from hardware sales and service fees and its airline marketing partners to secure airline programs. The timing and extent of that marketing will be dependent on the resources and efforts of the Company, its distributors, and partners.\n(7) Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements or labor contracts, including duration;\nThe Company originally acquired the application for an Australian patent and received notification that the International Preliminary Report on Patentability had been established. The Company filed national phase patent applications in Australia, the United States, China and European Union. In January 2010, the Company received the Australian patent. In January 2012, the Company received the Chinese patent. With the advent of Bluetooth\nSmart, the technology and the Companys IP has advanced to a point where the patent was no longer relevant. The Company subsequently decided to proceed no further with the patents, as the technology is predominately software based and protected by copyright.\n(8) Need for any government approval of principal products or services. If government approval is necessary and the small business issuer has not yet received that approval, discuss the status of the approval within the government approval process.\nInstallation and use of aircraft avionics in aircraft requires prior certification and approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and equivalent regulatory authorities of foreign governments on each aircraft type and for each airline, although FAA approval is generally globally acceptable.\nNormally the certification process begins with the installation of the system on an aircraft after which it is certified by an accredited engineer and organisation. The certification is then applicable to similar aircraft types and modified for other aircraft type. In countries other than the United States, the equivalent aviation authority procedures will apply to the certification of the system, but the United States FAA is generally accepted by local certifying authorities throughout the world. Prior to certification and approval, the manufacturer demonstrate that the system has been designed and manufactured and complies with the appropriate aviation standards. Historically, ASiQ has followed the certification path of DO-160 for hardware and DO-178 for software. Following this step, the system must be installed on an aircraft and tested, including a ground and flight test.\nDue to Covid over the previous 12-month period, the Companys industrial partner ASiQ, was forced to take an alternative approach. As AS-IPs launch customer Wizz Airs head office is in Hungary, we selected one of their UK registered aircraft for the flight trial. This enabled ASiQ to engage EU/UK aviation certified companies to produce the engineering/certification package and manufacture the certified installation kit.\nASiQ originally designed the business aircraft system to be is installed as a Portable Electronic Device PED and as such, little or no certification is required. The Company utilises the same process for airlines, which will ultimately lead to a lower cost certifiable platform.\nAs the App is installed on a mobile phone or tablet, which are regarded as carry on devices and operated in flight or offline mode, no aircraft certification is required however, in the majority of cases the final approval for use in flight will be at the discretion of the aircraft operator.\nFinally, both programs Android and IOS Apps are based on a Bluetooth network and Bluetooth has been tested and documented as safe for use in aircraft, which simplifies the operator acceptance process.\n(9) Effect of existing or probable governmental regulations on the business;\nThe company must maintain good standing, comply with applicable local business licensing requirements, prepare and file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and comply with other applicable securities laws, rules and regulations.\nExisting or probable governmental regulations have not impacted AS-IPs operations except for the increased costs of compliance with reporting obligations. These additional costs remain consistent as long as the company continues as a reporting corporation.\n(10) Estimate of the amount spent during each of the last two fiscal years on research and development activities, and if applicable the extent to which the cost of such activities is borne directly by customers;\nThe Company estimates over the last 2 years, it has expended in excess of $500,000 on research and development, none of which has been borne by the customers.\n(11) Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws (federal, state and local); and\nNot applicable\n(12) Number of total employees and number of full time employees.\nThe company does not have any employees, instead contracts the Chief Financial Officer, as well as contracting marketing and technical services as required.   ITEM 2. DESCRIPTION OF PROPERTY.\nThe Company maintains its corporate administration office at 1/15 Castles Drive, Torquay, Victoria, 3228, Australia. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nThe Company is not a party to any litigation and management has no knowledge of any threatened or pending litigation against the Company. ITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.\nNot applicable.\nPART II. ITEM 5. MARKET FOR COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDERS MATTERS.\nThe Company has authorized capital of 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.0001 par value, and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, $0.0001 par value. All shares of Common Stock have equal voting rights, are non-assessable, and have one vote per share. As of the date hereof, the Company has 278,697,573 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding and no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding.\nSince March 2000, the Companys Common Stock has been quoted on the NASD OTC Bulletin Board and more recently, the OTCPK. Prior to that date, there was no public market for the Companys securities. The following table sets out the range of the high and low sales prices for the Companys securities.\nCommon Stock\nQuarter Ended\nHigh\nLow\nJune 30, 2020\n$0.02\n$0.01\nSeptember 30, 2020\n$0.01\n$0.10\nDecember 31, 2020\n$0.10\n$0.05\nMarch 31, 2021\n$0.23\n$0.08\nJune 30, 2021\n$0.25\n$0.14\nSeptember 30, 2021\n$0.22\n$0.07\nDecember 31, 2021\n$0.28\n$0.08\nMarch 31, 2022\n$0.19\n$0.08\nJune 30, 2022\n$0.15\n$0.06\nThe Company currently intends to retain substantially all of its earnings, if any, to support the development of its business and has no present intention of paying any dividends on its Common Stock in the foreseeable future. Any future determination as to the payment of dividends will be at the discretion of the Board, and will depend on the Companys financial condition, results of operations and capital requirements, and such other factors as the Board deems relevant. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\nNot required for a smaller reporting company. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.\nOVERVIEW\nThe Companys corporate structure is designed to facilitate investment in owning aircraft systems and the IP, with the primary purpose of controlling service cash flow and dictating revenue share in the airline contracts.\nThe Company maintains a low-cost structure as it has no employees, contracting the services of executives and support as required. Because of the low-cost structure, the Company anticipates that the proceeds from stock issues and revenue from service and system sales, will be sufficient to meet the Companys operating and capital requirements for approximately 12 months.\nRESULTS AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company had accumulated losses from inception to June 30, 2022 of $16,351,745. Major components of the loss include capital raising costs, consulting and management fees, engineering fees and operations costs. The Company may be required to make significant additional expenditures in connection with the development of the BizjetMobile and fflya programs. The Companys ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its receiving funds through its anticipated sources of financing including capital raisings, borrowings and revenues from operations.\nYEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 COMPARED WITH YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2021\nIn the 2022 financial year, the Companys programs were still impacted by the Covid19 pandemic.\nThe Company received no revenue from its BizjetMobile business in the year ended June 30, 2022, compared to BizjetMobile service fees of $11,964 and BizjetMobile system sales $61,873, a total of $73,837 in the year ended June 30, 2021.\nBusiness jet system sales are now recovering, and revenue will begin in the second half of 2022 on BizjetMobile in early 2023 on fflya, once the initial fleet is equipped.\nOperating expenses increased from $733,962 for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021 to $1,280,966 for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2022 due to increased marketing, engineering and technical support costs and two years of unpaid directors fees.\nThe Company recorded a net loss from operations for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2022 of $1,280,966, compared to a loss of $660,125 for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021.\nOther expenses increased from $710,703 in the year ended June 30, 2021, to $875,661 in the year ended June 30, 2022, due to higher interest costs and loss on the issuance of shares for settlement of liabilities but without a charge for amortization of beneficial conversion feature.\nThe Company recorded a net loss for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2022 of $2,156,627, compared to a loss of $1,370,828 for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2021.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Companys cash and cash equivalents cash equivalents decreased from $157,601 at June 30, 2021 to $108,098 at June 30, 2022.\nThe Companys revenue for the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 was $0, compared to $73,837 in the twelve month period to June 30, 2021. Operating costs increased for the period from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022 mainly as a result increased marketing and engineering costs and directors fees. After loss on issuance of shares on settlement of liabilities, increased related party payables and issuance of shares for related party payables, the Company had a net cash outflow of $1,119,622 from operating activities for the period from July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022, compared to a net cash outflow from operating activities of $417,053 for the period from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.\nThe Company had no cash flow from investing activities for the twelve months ended June 30, 2022, and June 30, 2021 respectively.\nThe cash flow of the Company from financing activities for the twelve months ending June 30, 2022 was from the issue of common stock and shares issued in lieu of interest. In the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, financing activities was from issue of common stock and proceeds from loans.\nThe Companys business plan is focused on expansion into the airline business with its fflya program. This plan may require significant capital from the Company for marketing and technical and product support. The Company may not have sufficient funds to finance its operations in which case it will have to seek additional capital. The Company may raise additional capital by the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or from borrowings. The Company does not have a policy on the amount of borrowing or debt that the Company can incur.\nThe Company has no commitment for capital expenditure in the near future.\nOUTLOOK\nThe following are forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the Forward Looking Statement in Part I. of this Form 10-K.\nThe Company previously contracted ASiQ to supply and support the Bizjet program. Covid impacted the Bizjet market grounding all aircraft, and also ASiQ, the Companys industrial partner.\nIn order to retain the services of Ron Chapman and ASiQ and continue to support the Companies fflya program. Effective July 1st 2022, the Company is renegotiating the agreement with ASiQ in regard to the programs.\nASiQ provides the airline facilities, systems and support services funded as required on a nominal month by month basis by the Company.\nThe Companys primary focus over the past 12 months has been development of fflya to support its Wizz Air program.\nThe companys fflya business model is based on offering free messaging to be paid for by general and destination specific advertising and E-commerce. Under the fflya program, an airline will receive the system on a revenue share basis on terms to be agreed. As the equipment cost is a fraction of a Wi-Fi platform, the Company needs minimal commissions to justify the cost of the hardware. The Company believes LCAs will be attracted to this business model.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company recognizes revenue from the sales of goods and services under ASC 606 by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. .Revenue is recognised on the basis of net proceeds received from the Companys representatives, after commissions are deducted.\nGOING CONCERN\nThe financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As such, they do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts and classification of recorded assets and liabilities. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has suffered recurring losses from operations that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are described in Note 1 to the financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe Companys ability to continue its operations is dependent upon its raising of capital through debt or equity financing in order to meet its working needs. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern, and if substantial additional funding is not acquired or alternative sources developed, management will be required to curtail its operations.\nThe Company may raise additional capital by the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or from borrowing from a financial institution. The Company does not have a policy on the amount of borrowing or debt that the Company can incur. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nNot required for a smaller reporting company. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nAS-IP TECH, INC.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBalance sheets\nStatements of operations\nStatements of stockholders deficit\nStatements of cash flows\nNotes to financial statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the board of directors of AS-IP Tech, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of AS-IP Tech, Inc. as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, stockholders equity (deficit), and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has a significant accumulated deficit. In addition, the Company continues to experience negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

(AS-IP, the Company) formerly ASI Entertainment, Inc., was incorporated in the State of Delaware on April 29, 1998. The Company owns intellectual property from which two product lines called BizjetMobile and fflya have been developed. The products deliver inflight connectivity for business aviation (BizjetMobile) and commercial airlines (fflya) respectively.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements are expressed in United States dollars. The Companys fiscal year ends June 30.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has recurring operating losses, limited funds and has accumulated deficits. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt that the Company will be unable to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions. The Company expects to generate revenue in the future from the BizjetMobile and fflya businesses from the sale of hardware and provision of on-going services. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of assets and/or liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The continuation as a going concern is dependent upon the ability of the Company to meet our obligations on a timely basis, and, ultimately to attain profitability.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nThe Company considers investments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.\nFinancial instruments\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. ASC 820 provides a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information. The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between assumptions based on market data (observable inputs) and an entitys own assumptions (unobservable inputs). The hierarchy consists of three levels:\nLevel one - Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\nLevel two - Inputs other than level one inputs that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\nLevel three - Unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant would use.\nAS-IP TECH, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAll of the Companys financial instruments are level one and are carried at fair value, requiring no adjustment to book value. The financial instruments were deemed to qualify as that classification because their value was determined by the price of identical instruments traded on an active exchange.\nIntangible Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we classify intangible assets into three categories: (1) intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization; (2) intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. For intangible assets with definite lives, tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill, tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired.\nWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of intangible assets determined to have definite lives may not be recoverable, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value by preparing estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment loss. The impairment loss recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value which is estimated and calculated by discounted cash flow method. The Company has determined that an impairment charge is not required 2022 and 2021.\nIncome tax\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740 Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nAt June 30, 2022 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $14,395,200. The deferred tax asset created by the U.S. net operating losses has been offset by a 100% valuation allowance for those with a 20 year life of $1,963,496 in 2022, compared to $2,049,266 in 2021 and 100% allowance for those with an indefinite life of $1,059,496 in 2022.\nShare-based payments\nThe Company records stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.\nStock Options and Warrants\nWe estimate the fair value of stock option awards and warrants on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model, which is affected by our stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, risk free interest rates and expected dividends.\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nNet loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period as defined by FASB, ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic earnings per common share (EPS) calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are not considered in the computation.\nAS-IP TECH, INC.\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue share from the sales of goods and services by related party distributors under ASC 606 by applying the following steps: (1) identify the contract with a customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in the contract; and (5) recognize revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied. The Company recognizes revenue net of direct costs, such as commissions.\nThe Company receives revenue share from sales by related party distributors of products and services developed from the Companys intellectual property. Revenue is recognized on an accrual basis as earned under contract or license agreements. Communication services are provided on the basis of non refundable prepayment and revenue is recognized using the output method. Hardware sales require payment before delivery of the equipment.\nDeferred revenue\nThe Company receives payment for services in advance before the subscription service is provided. The company recognizes the revenue as being earned as the services are provided. Deferred revenue of $0 and $1,892 was recognized in the 2022 and 2021 years respectively.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts in the prior period presented, have been reclassified to conform to the current period financial statement presentation. These reclassification have no effect on previously reported net income.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe company has evaluated the recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nBeneficial Conversion Feature of Convertible Debt\nIn 2021, the Company accounted for convertible debt in accordance with the guidelines established by FASB ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. In 2022, the Company has Rosen to early adopt ASU 2020-06 and as a result, has reversed the balance of the Beneficial Conversion Feature (BCF).\nNOTE 2 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nAs of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company has recorded a current liability related parties payables of $484,938 and $536,075 respectively. The main component is advances made by the CFO to pay for operating expenses. From July 1, 2016, interest has accrued on amounts due to the CFO calculated quarterly at a rate of 6.5% per annum. Interest accrued for the advance in the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 was $11,771 and $14,208. The loan and accumulated interest will be repaid from surplus operating cash, when funds are available.
