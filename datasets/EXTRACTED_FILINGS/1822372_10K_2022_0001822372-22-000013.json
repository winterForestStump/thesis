We plan to organize the catalogue by categories and add tags. Thus, we expect that browsing by categories such as, sport industry or beauty industry or, simply, by tags such as sport, lifestyle or active can help to attract customers from various types of businesses.\nWe plan to attract the focus of our customers by means of a context advertising tools such as Google AdWords, Yahoo!

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters\nMarket Information\nThere is a limited public market for our common shares. Our common shares are not quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board at this time. Trading in stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board is often thin and is characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices due to many factors that may be unrelated to a companys operations or business prospects. We cannot assure you that there will be a market in the future for our common stock.\nOTC Bulletin Board securities are not listed or traded on the floor of an organized national or regional stock exchange. Instead, OTC Bulletin Board securities transactions are conducted through a telephone and computer network connecting dealers in stocks. OTC Bulletin Board issuers are traditionally smaller companies that do not meet the financial and other listing requirements of a regional or national stock exchange.\nAs of June 30, 2022, no shares of our common stock have traded.\nNumber of Holders\nAs of June 30, 2022, the 2,516,814 issued and outstanding shares of common stock were held by a total of 28 shareholder of record.\nDividends\nNo cash dividends were paid on our shares of common stock during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022and 2021.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nThe Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized.\nIn July 2021 the Company issued 19,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $950 at $0.05 per share.\nIn September 2021 the Company issued 116,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $5,800 at $0.05 per share.\nIn October 2021 the Company issued 57,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $2,850 at $0.05 per share.\nIn November 2021 the Company issued 38,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $1,900 at $0.05 per share.\nThere were 2,516,814 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and 2,286,814 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2021\nPurchase of our Equity Securities by Officers and Directors\nOn October 11, 2019, the Company offered and sold 2,000,000 restricted shares of common stock to our president and director, Stefan Dubs, for a purchase price of $0.001 per share, for aggregate offering proceeds of $2,000, pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 as he is a sophisticated investor and is in possession of all material information relating to us. Further, no commissions were paid to anyone in connection with the sale of these shares and general solicitation was not made to anyone.\nOther Stockholder Matters\nNone. Item 6. Selected Financial Data\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this prospectus. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this prospectus, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors section of this prospectus for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to:\nhave an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\nprovide an auditor attestation with respect to managements report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting;\ncomply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);\nsubmit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as say-on-pay and say-on-frequency; and\ndisclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEOs compensation to median employee compensation.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues is $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates is $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year period.\nResults of Operations for the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021:\nRevenue and cost of goods sold\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 the Company generated total revenue of $0 and $0 from selling products to the customer.\nOperating expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 were $39,189 and $13,382. The operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2022 included bank charges of $277; depreciation expense of $113; legal fees of $1,200; audit fees of $11,750 and professional fees of $25,849. The operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2021 included bank charges of $278; depreciation expense of $225; legal fees of $1,200; audit fees of $9,500; filing fees of $30 and professional fees of $2,149. Increase in expenses is due to nonoperational reasons, kind of expenses, connected with filings and professional promotion and business development.\nNet Loss\nThe net loss for the year ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 was $39,189 and $13,382 accordingly.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources and Cash Requirements\nAt year ended June 30, 2022 the Company had cash of $1,452 ($15,046 as of June 30, 2021). Furthermore, the Company had a negative working capital of $26,457 ($1,119 as of June 30, 2021). The increase in negative working capital is attributed to is due to a decrease in cash and an increase in accounts payable and deferred revenue balances as of June 30, 2022.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022 the Company used $25,094 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss and in accounts payable of $8,000, depreciation of $113 and deferred revenue of $5,982.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022 the Company generated $11,500 of cash in financing activities.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021 the Company used $11,157 of cash in operating activities due to its net loss and in accounts payable of $2,000 and depreciation of $225.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021 the Company used $338 of cash in investing activities.\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2021 the Company generated $14,341 of cash in financing activities.\nManagement believes that current trends toward lower capital investment in start-up companies pose the most significant challenge to the Companys success over the next year and in future years. Additionally, the Company will have to meet all the financial disclosure and reporting requirements associated with being a publicly reporting company. The Companys management will have to spend additional time on policies and procedures to make sure it is compliant with various regulatory requirements, especially that of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. This additional corporate governance time required of management could limit the amount of time management has to implement is business plan and impede the speed of its operations.\nLimited operating history; need for additional capital\nThere is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in a start-up stage of operations and have generated limited revenues since inception. We cannot guarantee that we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nNot applicable to smaller reporting companies. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nSTREETEX CORP.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2022 AND JUNE 30, 2021\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (ID 5525)\nBalance Sheets as of June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021\nStatements of Operations for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021\nStatement of Changes in Stockholders Equity for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021\nStatements of Cash Flows for the years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Streetex Corp.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Streetex Corp. (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended June 30, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has not earned revenue since inception and has an accumulated deficit. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nCritical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. We determined that there were no critical audit matters.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2020.\nFruci & Associates\nSpokane, Washington\nOctober 12, 2022\nSTREETEX CORP.\nBALANCE SHEETS\nJune 30, 2022 and 2021 (Audited)\nJune 30, 2022\nJune 30, 2021\nASSETS\nCurrent Assets\nCash and cash equivalents $ 1,452 $ 15,046\nTotal Current Assets\n1,452\n15,046\nFixed Assets\nEquipment, net\n-\nTotal Fixed Assets\n-\nTotal Assets $ 1,452 $ 15,159\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY(DEFICIT)\nLiabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nAccounts payable $ 10,000 $ 2,000\nRelated party loan\n11,927\n11,927\nDeferred revenue\n5,982\n-\nTotal Current Liabilities\n27,909\n13,927\nTotal Liabilities\n27,909\n13,927\nCommitments and Contingencies\n-\n-\nStockholders Equity(Deficit)\nCommon stock, par value $0.001; 75,000,000 shares authorized, 2,516,814 and 2,286,814 shares issued and outstanding as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021\n2,517\n2,287\nAdditional paid in capital\n25,324\n14,054\nAccumulated deficit\n(54,298)\n(15,109)\nTotal Stockholders Equity(Deficit)\n(26,457)\n1,232\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders Equity(Deficit) $ 1,452 $ 15,159\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements\nSTREETEX CORP.\nSTATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (Audited)\nYear ended\nJune 30, 2022\nYear ended\nJune 30, 2021\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses $ (39,189) $ (13,382)\nTOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES\n(39,189)\n(13,382)\nNET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n(39,189)\n(13,382)\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n-\n-\nNET LOSS $ (39,189) $ (13,382)\nNET LOSS PER SHARE: BASIC AND DILUTED\n$\n(0.02)\n$\n(0.01)\nWEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING: BASIC AND DILUTED\n2,454,275\n2,053,784\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements\nSTREETEX CORP.\nSTATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY\nYear ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (Audited)\nCommon Stock\nAdditional Paid-in Capital\nAccumulated Deficit\nTotal Stockholders Equity (Deficit)\nShares\nAmount\nJune 30, 2020 2,000,000 $ 2,000 $ - $ (1,727) $\nIssuance of common stock 286,814\n14,054\n-\n14,341\nNet loss -\n-\n-\n(13,382)\n(13,382)\nJune 30, 2021 2,286,814 $ 2,287 $ 14,054 $ (15,109) $ 1,232\nIssuance of common stock 230,000\n11,270\n-\n11,500\nNet loss -\n-\n-\n(39,189)\n(39,189)\nJune 30, 2022 2,516,814 $ 2,517 $ 25,324 $ (54,298) $ (26,457)\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements.\nSTREETEX CORP.\nSTATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nYear ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 (Audited)\nYear ended\nJune 30, 2022\nYear ended\nJune 30, 2021\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES\nNet loss $ (39,189) $ (13,382)\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash from operating activities:\nDepreciation expense\nAccounts payable\n8,000\n2,000\nDeferred revenue\n5,982\nCASH FLOWS USED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES\n(25,094)\n(11,157)\nCASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES\nPurchase of equipment\n-\n(338)\nCASH FLOWS USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES\n-\n(338)\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\nProceeds from sale of stock\n11,500\n14,341\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\n11,500\n14,341\nNET CHANGE IN CASH\n(13,594)\n2,846\nCash, beginning of period\n15,046\n12,200\nCash, end of period $ 1,452 $ 15,046\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION:\nInterest paid $ - $ -\nIncome taxes paid $ - $ -\nSee accompanying notes, which are an integral part of these financial statements\nSTREETEX CORP.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022 (Audited)\nNote 1 - ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS\nSTREETEX CORP. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 4, 2018. Our company intends to operate in the business of video advertisement for business entities or private individuals. We plan to produce advertising video content for social networks such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and many others. Our principal services are aimed at bloggers, SMM managers and/or companies to promote their services on social web platforms.\nNote 2 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At June 30, 2022, the Company had cash of $1,452 and negative working capital of $26,457. For the year ended June 30, 2022 the Company had no revenues and an accumulated deficit of $54,298. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company`s ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in its endeavors or become financially viable and continue as a going concern.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNote 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of presentation\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Companys year-end is June 30.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nEquipment\nEquipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Purchased equipment is multifunction printer. The cost of equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over one year. We capitalize assets with a useful life of one year and greater, or over $1,000. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Additions, major renewals and replacements that increase the equipment's useful life are capitalized. Equipment sold or retired, together with the related accumulated depreciation is removed from the appropriated accounts and the resultant gain or loss is included in net income.\nPurchased equipment was fully depreciated as of June 30, 2022.\nBasic Income (Loss) Per Share\nNet income (loss) per common share is computed pursuant to FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and warrants. There were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the periods presented.\nSTREETEX CORP.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022 (Audited)\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, and advances payable to sole officer and director. The carrying amount of these financial instruments approximates fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASC 606 adoption is on February 1, 2018. The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. An entity recognizes revenue in accordance with that core principle by applying the following steps: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. Specifically, Section 606-10-50 requires an entity to provide information about: a. Revenue recognized from contracts with customers, including the disaggregation of revenue into appropriate categories; b. Contract balances, including the opening and closing balances of receivables, contract assets, and contract liabilities; c. Performance obligations, including when the entity typically satisfies its performance obligations and the transaction price that is allocated to the remaining performance obligations in a contract; d. Significant judgments, and changes in judgments, made in applying the requirements to those contracts. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has generated $0 in revenue.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCertain accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB and other standard setting organizations which are not yet effective and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Company. The impact on the Company`s financial position and results of operations from adoption of these standards is not expected to be material.\nNote 4 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, our sole director has loaned to the Company $0. This loan is unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.\nThe balance due to the director was $11,927 as of June 30, 2022 and $11,927 as of the year end June 30, 2021.\nNote 5 - COMMON STOCK\nThe Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock authorized.\nAs of July 01, 2022 the Company issued 2,286,814.\nSTREETEX CORP.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022 (Audited)\nIn July 2021 the Company issued 19,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $950 at $0.05 per share.\nIn September 2021 the Company issued 116,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $5,800 at $0.05 per share.\nIn October 2021 the Company issued 57,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $2,850 at $0.05 per share.\nIn November 2021 the Company issued 38,000 shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $1,900 at $0.05 per share.\nThere were 2,516,814 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2022 and 2,286,814 shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of June 30, 2021.\nNote 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nFrom time-to-time, the Company is subject to various litigation and other claims in the normal course of business. The Company establishes liabilities in connection with legal actions that management deems to be probable and estimable. No amounts have been accrued in the financial statements with respect to any matters.\nNote 7 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company adopted the provisions of uncertain tax positions as addressed in ASC 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740). As a result of the implementation of ASC 740, the Company recognized no increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. As of June 30, 2022 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $54,298 that may be available to reduce future years taxable income in varying amounts through 2031. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards.\nThe valuation allowance at June 30, 2022 was approximately $11,403. The valuation allowance at June 30, 2021 was approximately $3,173. The net change in valuation allowance for the year ended June 30, 2022 was $8,230. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized.\nThe ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2022. All tax years since inception remain open for examination by taxing authorities.\nThe provision for Federal income tax consists of the following:\nYear ended June 30, 2022 Year ended June 30, 2021\nNon-current deferred tax assets:\nNet operating loss carry forward $ (11,403) (3,173)\nValuation allowance $ 11,403 3,173\nNet deferred tax assets $ - -\nSTREETEX CORP.\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJune 30, 2022 (Audited)\nThe actual tax benefit at the expected rate of 21% differs from the expected tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2022 as follows:\nYear ended June 30, 2022 Year ended June 30, 2021\nComputed expected tax expense (benefit)\n$\n(8,230) (2,810)\nChange in valuation allowance $ 8,230 2,810\nActual tax expense (benefit) $ - -\nThe related deferred tax benefit on the above unutilized tax losses has a full valuation allowance not recognized against it as there is no certainty of its realization. Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those disclosed.\nNote 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIn accordance with ASC 855, Subsequent Events, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent through October 14, 2022, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.\nDirector and management stay informed about COVID-19 developments generally and ensure it has access to information related to a companys response to the crisis and how the specific impact on the company is developing as the crisis extends. Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone Item 9A(T) Controls and Procedures\nManagements Report on Internal Controls over Financial Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)). The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Tread way Commission (\"COSO\").\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Companys annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below.\n1. We do not have an Audit Committee - While not being legally obligated to have an audit committee, it is the managements view that such a committee, including a financial expert member, is an utmost important entity level control over the Companys financial statement. Currently the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of the Audit Committee, and does not include a member that is considered to be independent of management to provide the necessary oversight over managements activities.\n2. We did not maintain appropriate cash controls - As of June 30, 2022, the Company has not maintained sufficient internal controls over financial reporting for the cash process, including failure to segregate cash handling and accounting functions, and did not require dual signature on the Companys bank accounts. Alternatively, the effects of poor cash controls were mitigated by the fact that the Company had limited transactions in their bank accounts.\n3. We did not implement appropriate information technology controls - As at June 30, 2022, the Company retains copies of all financial data and material agreements; however there is no formal procedure or evidence of normal backup of the Companys data or off-site storage of data in the event of theft, misplacement, or loss due to unmitigated factors.\nAccordingly, the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the companys internal controls.\nAs a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control- Integrated Framework issued by COSO.\nSystem of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commissions rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAn evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
