    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nBUSINESS\nOverview of the Company\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (the Company), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing novel immunotherapies to transform cancer care. Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer as they harness the bodys own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT\u2122 targeted immunotherapy in combination with an immune check point inhibitor in a pivotal1 Phase 3 study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. BriaCell recently reported benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in advanced metastatic breast with median overall survival of 13.5 months in BriaCells advanced metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months for similar patients reported in the literature2. A completed Bria-IMT\u2122 Phase 1 combination study with retifanlimab (an anti-PD1 antibody manufactured by Incyte) confirmed tolerability and early-stage efficacy. BriaCell is also developing a personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy, Bria-OTS\u2122, which provides a platform technology to develop personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies for numerous types of cancer, and a soluble CD80 protein therapeutic which acts both as a stimulator of the immune system as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\nMarket\nIt is estimated by the National Cancer Institute that in 2023, approximately 297,790 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in the United States. That means that every two minutes an American woman is diagnosed with breast cancer and more than 43,170 are projected to die in 2023. Although about 100 times less common than in women, breast cancer also affects men. It is estimated that the lifetime risk of men getting breast cancer is about 1 in 1,000, and the American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 2,800 new cases of invasive male breast cancer will be diagnosed and approximately 530 men will die from breast cancer in 2023.\nAccording to the May 2023 Global Oncology Trends 2023 report by the IQVIA Institute, the global market for cancer drugs (including immunotherapy drugs) is expected to reach nearly $375 billion by the end of 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17% between 2023 and 2027, of which about 20% is expected to be immuno-oncology drugs.\nPivotal is an industry term referring to a Phase 3 clinical study intended to show and confirm the safety and efficacy of a treatment.\nCortes J, et al. Annals of Oncology 2018; Kazmi S, et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Aug 17; OShaughnessy J et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2022; Tripathy D, et al. JAMA Oncol. 2022\nAbout 13% percent of women will be diagnosed with breast cancer at some point during their lifetime. In 2022, over 4 million women were living with female breast cancer in the United States. Approximately 83% of cases present as invasive breast cancer. Approximately 6% of new breast cancer diagnoses are Stage IV (metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which has already spread to other organs). Twenty to thirty percent of all women diagnosed with breast cancer will develop MBC. Breast cancer can be subdivided based on receptor status - the hormone receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR), collectively referred to as hormone receptors (HR), and the Her2/neu growth factor receptor (HER2). Based on the latest SEER statistics, 68% were found to be HR+/HER2\u2212, 10% were triple-negative (HR\u2212/HER2\u2212), 10% were HR+/HER2+, and 4% were HR\u2212/HER2+.1\nIt is estimated that over 150,000 women in the US are living with MBC.2 For those with metastatic disease at diagnosis, their 5-year survival rate is 30%.1 For patients who develop MBC after initially having localized disease, if they had a good response to treatment (i.e. a disease-free interval of more than 24 months), their survival rate is similar to that of patients with MBC at initial diagnosis, but if their disease-free interval is less than 24 months, their prognosis is worse.4 We currently propose that Bria-IMTs\u2122 indication will be for the treatment of patients with MBC who have no approved alternative therapies available. Similarly, another study showed that the median overall survival among patients with de novo stage IV MBC was 39.2 months, while for patients with relapsed disease it was 27.2 months.5 Median progression free survival after first-line therapy is only 9 months and the survival benefit decreases with subsequent lines of therapy.6 One study showed that of 386 patients with MBC, 374 (97%) received first-line therapy, 254 (66%) received second-line therapy, 175 (45%) received third-line therapy, and 105 (27%) received therapy beyond third-line.7\n1 See https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/breast-cancer-facts-and-figures/2022-2024-breast-cancer-fact-figures-acs.pdf\nMariotto AB, Etzioni R, Hurlbert M, Penberthy L, Mayer M.

These precedents demonstrate a strong market pull for Bria-IMT\u2122.\nThe best response to the Bria-IMT\u2122 monotherapy regimen to date is in patients who matched Bria-IMT\u2122 at one or more HLA alleles, with higher response rates for patients with 2+ HLA allele matches. If one HLA allele match is found to be sufficient, we will be able to treat ~50-60% of the patient population, while patients with 2+ HLA matches constitutes ~15-35% of cases.8 We also saw higher clinical benefit rates for patients with grade I/II tumors. Tumor differentiation in breast cancer cell lines is often described by their classification as Luminal, Basal A and Basal B subtypes, with Luminal representing well differentiated tumors, Basal B poorly differentiated tumors, and Basal A an intermediate stage tumor (moderately differentiated).2 Yao and colleagues in 2005 identified a 9-gene signature (AURKB, CENPI, DEPDC1, DEPDC1B, FAM83D, FGD3, NCAPH, TNFRSF18, FCGR1A) discriminating poorly (grade 3) from moderately (grade 2) differentiated tumors.3 To understand the place of SV-BR-1-GM in this model, we compared its RNA expression profile with those of three other cell lines representing Luminal (MCF-7), Basal A (MDA-MB-468) and Basal B (MDA-MB-231), using a 10-gene signature (AURKB, CENPI, DEPDC1, DEPDC1B, FAM83D, FGD3, NCAPH, DLGAP, KIF2C, VAV3) derived from those by Yao and colleagues. The results, shown in the figure below, demonstrate that Bria-IMT\u2122 most closely clusters with MDA-MB-468 and as such is considered a grade II moderately differentiated cell line.\nGreece: Results from the EMERGE multicenter retrospective chart review study.

Improved survival in metastatic breast cancer 1985-2016. Breast. 2017 Feb;31:46-50. Doi: 10.1016/j.breast.2016.10.005. Epub 2016 Nov 2). In patients with relapsed disease, the overall survival following relapse appears similar for those with grade II and grade III tumors.9\nMore recent information comes from combination therapy studies of the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI). In the ongoing study of BRI-ROL-001, in phase I the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen was dosed in combination with Keytruda \u00ae in 11 patients and in 12 patients with Zynyz\u00ae with one patient starting on the combination with Keytruda\u00ae and crossing-over to the combination with Zynyz\u00ae (22 patients total). In phase II of the study, the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen is being dosed in combination with Zynyz\u00ae with patients randomized to either receive the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen first (12 patients) or Zynyz\u00ae first (12 patients). For the 11 patients treated in combination with Keytruda\u00ae in phase I, the disease control data is shown below:\n\u25a0 11 patients were treated with Bria-IMT\u2122 + Keytruda\u00ae\n\u25a0 All patients were very heavily pre-treated with a median of 7 prior systemic therapy regimens (i.e. chemotherapy), further underscoring BriaCells positive patient outcomes\n\u25a0 Tolerability excellent with no dose-limiting toxicities\n\u25a0 Clinical benefit demonstrated: 1 PR and 3 SD in 8 immune responders\nFor the 12 patients treated in combination with Zynyz\u00ae in phase I, the disease control data is shown below:\n\u25a0 12 patients were treated with Bria-IMT\u2122 plus Zynyz\u00ae\n\u25a0 All patients were very heavily pre-treated with a median of 5 prior systemic therapy regimens (i.e. chemotherapy), further underscoring BriaCells positive patient outcomes\n\u25a0 Tolerability excellent with no dose-limiting toxicities\n\u25a0 Efficacy: 70% (7/10) of evaluable patients showed disease control (5/10 evaluable patients including 1 PR and 4 SD) and/or progression-free survival (PFS) benefits compared with their last therapy regimen.\nThe overall survival of the patients for all patients on this study has been evaluated in an ongoing fashion. Since the study was largely on hold during COVID (2020 and 2021), patients dosed in 2019 and 2020 have been followed for a longer time. Therefore survival data has been evaluated for patients dosed before 2022 and since 2022. This should be considered in the context of clinical studies in patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed at least 2 prior regimens.

For patients treated since 2022, the median OS has not been reached.\nFigure B. Overall Survival of Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer treated with the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen with a CPI.\nThe market for breast cancer drugs is a multibillion-dollar market with new drugs being approved on an ongoing basis, indicating the shortage of safe and effective treatments for this deadly disease. Figure A summarizes current drugs on the market utilized in combination therapy along with their reported market sales, which further supports market potential for Bria-IMT\u2122 to be used for combination therapy for breast cancer patients.\nWe propose the following calculation in order to show the rationale behind the number of patients that we anticipate can be currently treated by SV-BR-1-GM:\nUSA - 2022\nReferences\nBreast Cancer Incidence\n128.3/100K\n287K\n\u25cf Breast cancer incidence and mortality.

Comparable studies looking primarily at second line or later treatment are shown in Table A, below. Evaluating response rates (partial and complete responses = ORR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from clinical trials in similar subjects with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer indicate that response rates range from 2.7% up to 59%, depending on the population studied and the intervention (median 24%). PFS ranges from 8 weeks to 12 months (median 5 months) and OS from 6 months to 31 months (median 13 months).\nTable A: Studies evaluating second-line or later treatment options. Data depict an unpredictable response rate to treatment ranging from 6.9-59%, therefore establishing and confirming the opportunity for Bria-IMT\u2122.\nStudy Treatment & Design # of Pts ORR PFS/TTP OS\nLicchetta15\nCyclophosphamide and megestrol acetate 31 % 7.4 mo 13.4 mo\nHarvey16 Docetaxel Monotherapy 60 mg/m2 22.1 % 12.7 wk 10.6 mo\nDocetaxel Monotherapy 75 mg/m2 23.3 % 15.0 wk 10.3 mo\nDocetaxel Monotherapy 100 mg/m2 36.0 % 16.6 wk 12.3 mo\nRivera17 Docetaxel Monotherapy q3wk 35.6 % 5.7 mo 18.3 mo\nDocetaxel Monotherapy qwk 20.3 % 5.5 mo 18.6 mo\nGradishar18 ABI-007 (Nab paclitaxel) 33 % 23.0 wk 65.0 wk\nPaclitaxel Monotherapy 19 % 16.9 wk 55.7 wk\nABI-007 (Nab paclitaxel) 2nd line 27 % 20.9 wk 56.4 wk\nPaclitaxel Monotherapy 2nd line 13 % 16.1 wk 46.7 wk\nPerez19 Ixabepilone Monotherapy 11.5 % 3.1 mo 8.6 mo\nLeyland-Jones20 Trastuzumab with paclitaxel 59 % 12.2 mo\nvon Minckwitz21 Trastuzumab with capecitabine 48.1 % 8.2 mo 25.5 mo\nCapecitabine Monotherapy 27.0 % 5.6 mo 20.4 mo\nVerma22 Trastuzumab emtansine 43.6 % 9.6 mo 30.9 mo\nlapatinib plus capecitabine 30.8 % 6.4 mo 25.1 mo\nGeyer23 Lapatinib plus capecitabine 22 % 8.4 mo\nCapecitabine Monotherapy 14 % 4.4 mo\nBartsch24 Capecitabine and trastuzumab 20 % 8 mo 24 mo\nBlackwell25 Lapatinib Monotherapy 6.9 % 8.1 wk 39.0 wk\nLapatinib with trastuzumab 10.3 % 12.0 wk 51.6 wk\nCortes26 Vinflunine\n9.8 mo\nalkylating agent\n7.2 mo\nKazmi27 Eribulin\n9.1 mo\nGemcitabine\n9.1 mo\nCapecitabine\n9.3 mo\nOShaughnessy28 Sacituzumab 31 % 4.6 mo 12.4 mo\nTreatment of Physicians Choice 4 % 2.3 mo 6.7 mo\nTripathy29 Etirinotecan Pegol 4.8 % 2.8 mo 7.8 mo\nTreatment of Physicians Choice 2.7 % 1.9 mo 7.5 mo\nMBC treated with second or higher lines of therapy has a very poor prognosis and few effective therapies that consistently induce long-term remission,29 which indicates the market demand and clinical need for new and improved therapeutic drugs and treatment options in order to improve these response outcomes and patient survival rates. Thus, Bria-IMT\u2122 has the potential to induce long-term remission, especially in combination with immunotherapies.

The most studied targeted immunotherapy, Neuvax (Galena), a HER2 peptide vaccine, failed a Phase III trial, but there is encouraging data to support at least three ongoing clinical trials combining trastuzumab with HER2 epitope immunogens.32 The National Cancer Institute (NCI) randomized trial adding PANVAC (a poxviral-based immunogen) to docetaxel increased the median PFS from 3.9 months to 7.9 months and is to be used as a basis for larger, more sophisticated clinical trials.33 An immunogen targeting a carbohydrate antigen, globo-H, was associated with improved PFS, but only in the subset able to mount antibody responses.34 A Johns Hopkins breast cancer trial using a breast cancer cell line transfected with the gene for GM-CSF has not been positive but, using the same cell line with trastuzumab, 40% of patients enjoyed clinical benefit (CR+PR+stable) at one year.35 Finally, the study of targeted cancer immunotherapies in combination with other therapies is receiving much attention, particularly combination with checkpoint inhibitors.36\nRossi, V.; Nole, F.; Redana, S.; Adamoli, L.; Martinello, R.; Aurilio, G.; Verri, E.; Sapino, A.; Viale, G.; Aglietta, M.; Montemurro, F., Clinical outcome in women with HER2-positive de novo or recurring stage IV breast cancer receiving trastuzumab-based therapy.

Clin Adv Hematol Oncol 2016, 14 (11), 922-933.\nThere are several other approaches to developing targeted breast cancer immunotherapies. These include using peptide cocktails, a triple peptide regimen, recombinant HER2, antigen-pulsed dendritic cells, DNA immunogens, whole cell allogeneic GM-CSF secreting SKBR3 or T47D cells, an (HLA)-A2/A3-restricted immunogenic peptide derived from the HER2 protein, oxidized mannan-MUC1, and personalized peptide immunogens.\nAmong the most promising results in patients with advanced disease have been using whole-cell preparations, particularly if the cells are engineered to express GM-CSF. We are taking this approach and capitalizing on positive initial results with Bria-IMT\u2122 monotherapy in difficult to treat patients using a regimen that both limits regulatory T cell activity (using low dose cyclophosphamide pre-treatment) and boosts the immune response (using post-dose alpha interferon in the inoculation sites). The combination with PD-1 inhibitors is a logical extension of our findings where 21 of 23 MBC patients had demonstrable PD-L1 expression on the circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and/or circulating cancer-associated macrophage-like cells (CAMLs). The overall strategy, once the initial milestones have been met, to enroll additional patients for product registration, will allow rapid progression of the best therapeutic option to a Biologics License Application (BLA).\nProducts/Pipeline\nBria-IMT\u2122\nBria-IMT\u2122, BriaCells lead candidate, is a whole-cell immunotherapy. Bria-IMT\u2122 in combination with an immune check point inhibitor is undergoing pivotal Phase 3 clinical testing in patients with advanced MBC patients who have failed prior lines of therapy. The pivotal Phase 3 combination study is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06072612.\nBria-IMT\u2122 is currently under Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) intended to accelerate the review process of novel treatments that address unmet medical needs. Positive completion of the pivotal study, following review by the FDA, could lead to full approval of the Bria-IMT\u2122 immune checkpoint inhibitor combination in advanced metastatic breast cancer.\nThe FDA has agreed that improvement in overall survival in the Bria-IMT\u2122 combination arm as compared to the physicians choice of treatment arm will be the primary endpoint of the study. The study is expected to enroll 177 patients in the Bria-IMT\u2122 combination therapy arm and 177 patients in the treatment of physicians choice arm. To gather additional information on the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen alone, 50 patients are expected to be enrolled in this regimen and will be eligible for combination therapy following their initial post treatment evaluation. The study will have an interim evaluation for efficacy which could result in early completion of the study. We expect frequent and responsive FDA communication under our Fast Track status during our pivotal Phase 3 study.\nThe successful completion of the pivotal study would allow BriaCell to subsequently submit a Biologics License Application and accelerate the path to commercialization.\nBriaCells recently announced partnership with New York Cancer & Blood Specialists (NYCBS) as clinical site with more than 30 locations and 35 hospital affiliations throughout Nassau and Suffolk counties, in the Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, and Brooklyn to conduct its pivotal Phase 3 Study of Bria-IMT\u2122 in Advanced Breast Cancer.\nIn collaboration with Prevail InfoWorks, Inc. (InfoWorks), a Philadelphia, PA based contract research organization, BriaCell expects to recruit additional sites to speed up the patient recruitment process. BriaCell has signed a Master Service and Technology Agreement (MSTA) agreement with InfoWorks to provide clinical services and technologies for BriaCells upcoming pivotal study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. Services include clinical site coordination, project management, clinical monitoring and pharmacovigilance (safety management) services, and the use of InfoWorks integrated real-time data analytics platform, The Single Interface \u00ae, for clinical support and real-time data analysis.\nPrevail Partners, LLC (Prevail Partners), an investment fund and affiliate of InfoWorks, has purchased 463,408 BriaCell common shares at a price of $8.63 for gross proceeds of $4 million, representing a 20% premium to the trailing thirty (30) trading day volume-weighted average price of the common shares of the Company on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange. The transaction closed on May 19, 2023.\nRecent Letter of Intent from Weill Cornell Medicine Outlining Plans to Initiate a Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Bria-IMT\u2122 in High-Risk Early-Stage Triple Negative Breast Cancer\nBriaCell recently announced that it has accepted a letter of intent from Dr. Massimo Cristofanilli, Director of Breast Medical Oncology and Associate Director of Precision Medicine in the Sandra and Edward Meyer Cancer Center at Weill Cornell Medicine, outlining the parties plans and commitment, upon regulatory approval, to initiate a Phase 2 investigator-initiated clinical study to evaluate BriaCells novel immunotherapy, Bria-IMT\u2122, in combination with a check point inhibitor, in early stage, newly diagnosed, high-risk triple negative breast cancer patients who have failed to achieve a pathological complete response in the neoadjuvant setting.\nPhase 1/2 Clinical Trial of Bria-IMT\u2122 in Combination with Immune Check Point Inhibitors in Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer\nBriaCell has been conducting a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of Bria-IMT\u2122, in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA\u00ae; manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.) and retifanlimab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor manufactured by Incyte). The combination study is listed in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT03328026 under FDA-approved BB-IND 10312 under protocol BRI-ROL-001 at ten clinical sites throughout the United States.\nBriaCell recently announced benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in advanced metastatic breast cancer with median overall survival of 13.5 months in BriaCells advanced metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months for similar patients reported in the literature.\nBriaCell has achieved proof of concept based on data from a Phase 1/2a study of Bria-IMT\u2122 in advanced breast cancer patients. In essence, BriaCell has demonstrated disease control and clinical benefit in a high proportion of patients with advanced breast cancer who have exhausted other therapeutic options. There is also promising data on overall survival as noted above.\nPositive Proof of Concept\n\u25cf Bria-IMT\u2122 has been evaluated in a regimen including pre-dose low-dose cyclophosphamide (to reduce immune suppression), intradermal inoculation with 20-50 million irradiated Bria-IMT\u2122 cells between two and three days later, with subsequent intradermal inoculation with interferon-\u03b12 approximately two days later. This is known as the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen.\n\u25cf BriaCell has evaluated the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen in two Phase I/IIa studies of Bria-IMT\u2122 in advanced breast cancer patients. Both were single arm studies, so there were no untreated patients for comparison.\n\u25cf There were four evaluable patients treated in one study (Study SVMC #01-026) and 23 evaluable patients treated in another study (Study WRI-GEV-007) with this regimen with cycles every two weeks for the first month and then monthly. They were heavily pre-treated with a median of four prior systemic therapy regimens.\n\u25cf The data shows an outstanding safety and tolerability profile for Bria-IMT\u2122 in advanced breast cancer patients.\nStudy SVMC #01-026\n\u25cf In the SVMC #01-026 study, treatment was limited to six cycles over five months. Four post-menopausal white women were enrolled aged between 58.7 and 73 years. Three had breast cancer and one had Her2+ ovarian cancer. All had failed at least one prior systemic therapy.\n\u25cf These patients received between four and six cycles of treatment on protocol. One patient had an additional 13 cycles off protocol.\n\u25cf The only adverse events that occurred in more than one patient were itch and rash at the inoculation sites. No deaths were reported during this study. There were four serious adverse events (SAEs) in 3 patients with one (transient urticaria, grade 3) judged probably related to treatment. All SAEs were manageable with community practice therapies.\n\u25cf The Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen was able to elicit delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses in all patients. DTH is a measure of cell-mediated immunity. This response involves the interaction of T-cells, monocytes, and macrophages. This reaction is caused when CD4+ Th1 helper T cells recognize foreign antigen in a complex with the Class II HLA molecule on the surface of antigen-presenting cells. These can be macrophages or dendritic cells that secrete monokines such as IL-12 and IL-15, which stimulates the proliferation of additional CD4+ Th1 cells. CD4+ T cells secrete other cytokines including IL-2 and interferon gamma, inducing the further release of other TH1 cytokines, thus mediating the immune response. This results also in the activation of CD8+ T cells which destroy target cells on contact, and activated macrophages which produce hydrolytic enzymes.\n\u25cf The DTH response involves the interaction of T-cells, monocytes, and macrophages.

This results also in the activation of CD8+ T cells which destroy target cells on contact and activated macrophages which produce hydrolytic enzymes.\n\u25cf One patient (A002) had a partial response with regression of breast lesions, resolution of lung and soft tissue lesions, and improvement of stability of bone lesions. She completed therapy and 3 months after her last Bria-IMT\u2122 inoculation, imaging studies identified regrowth of tumor notably in the breast, lung, and brain. After consultation with the FDA, the patient was treated off-protocol which also produced tumor regression, including the resolution of brain metastases. The HLA-DRB3 and HLA-DRB1 alleles of patient A002 matched with that of SV-BR-1-GM. Her tumor was grade II (moderately differentiated). One other patient on this study (B001) with a grade II tumor had disease limited to bony metastases. She did not have measurable disease but was felt to progress on study.\n\u25cf Median time to tumor progression was 144 days (range 64 - 223 days) for the initial round of treatment. Overall survival was more than 33 months in all patients except B001 (7 months).\nStudy WRI-GEV-007\n\u25cf In the WRI-GEV-007 study, patients were treated with a median of three cycles of therapy (range 1-8).\n\u25cf The Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen was able to elicit both cellular immune responses (as evidenced by DTH responses in 85% of patients evaluated) and antibody responses (present in 58% of patients evaluated).\n\u25cf The most common adverse events seen were local irritation at the inoculation sites.\n\u25cf Several patients showed evidence of anti-tumor activity of the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen in spite of their being heavily pre-treated advanced breast cancer patients. Specifically, one patient (designated 01-002) had regression or disappearance of 20 lung metastases, and stable disease in liver metastases (as the liver metastases were the target lesions, she did not qualify as a partial response). She displayed a robust DTH response, had a grade I tumor and matched Bria-IMT\u2122 at 2 HLA loci. One patient (05-002) had a reduction in the size of a breast lesion but progression of a liver lesion and did not meet criteria for a partial response. She also displayed a robust DTH response, had a grade II tumor and matched Bria-IMT\u2122 at 2 HLA loci. One patient (01-005) had a marked reduction in cutaneous involvement but developed restrictive cardiomyopathy (unrelated to study drug) with subsequent mortality. She had a grade III (poorly differentiated) tumor and matched Bria-IMT\u2122 at one HLA locus. She was not on study long enough to be evaluated for her response.\n\u25cf Patients 01-002, 05-002 and 01-005 who showed objective evidence of tumor shrinkage all matched the Bria-IMT\u2122 cell line at least at one HLA locus and all had evidence of DTH responses to Bria-IMT\u2122 and/or the parent cell line (SV-BR-1 - the breast cancer cell line from which Bria-IMT\u2122 was derived). Patients who did not develop a DTH response did not show evidence of tumor shrinkage.\n\u25cf Patients 01-002 and 05-002 had grade I/II tumors. Both of them also had two HLA matches with Bria-IMT\u2122. Two other patients with grade II tumors (patient 03-001 and 06-001) had stable disease on the study and were also considered to have received clinical benefit from the treatment. (Clinical benefit was defined as some evidence of tumor shrinkage (including a mixed response with shrinkage of some tumors but progression of others, as for 05-002) with over 90 days on study; or as stable disease, a partial response or a complete response as per RECIST criteria). Neither 03-001 nor 06-001 had HLA matches with Bria-IMT\u2122, suggesting that HLA matching may not be required for clinical benefit in patients with grade I/II tumors. Thus, four of the six patients with grade I/II tumors exhibited clinical benefit. One of the remaining patients showed no evidence of an immune response as evaluated by DTH. Thus, four of the five grade I/II patients able to develop an immune response, as noted by DTH, exhibited clinical benefit.\n\u25cf These preliminary data indicate that the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen in advanced breast cancer patients is well tolerated, able to elicit an immune response and able to induce reduction in tumor burden.\nStudy BRI-ROL-001\n\u25cf Another phase I/IIa study (BRI-ROL-001) was initiated evaluating the combination of the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen with KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab). This combination combines the induction of an immune response by Bria-IMT\u2122 (i.e. putting the foot on the gas of the immune response) with the ability of KEYTRUDA\u00ae to block the PD-1 - PD-L1 immune checkpoint (i.e. to take the foot off the brakes of the immune response).\n\u25cf Eleven patients with advanced breast cancer (median of four prior systemic therapy regimens) have been treated with this regimen with cycles every three weeks for a median of three cycles (range 1 - 9 cycles).\n\u25cf Two patients had evidence of tumor regression, both of whom had robust immune responses (as measured by DTH) to Bria-IMT\u2122. Both of them had grade II tumors. One matched Bria-IMT\u2122 at two HLA types (06-005) while the other did not match Bria-IMT\u2122 at any HLA types (06-001, who rolled over from the WRI-GEV-007 study where she had stable disease), suggesting that the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen, when given in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor, may be able to induce tumor regression without an HLA match especially in patients with grade I/II tumors. One additional patient (06-004) in this study had a grade II tumor and was noted to have stable disease. The other seven patients treated had grade III tumors (poorly differentiated). Thus, all three of the patients with grade I/II tumors showed evidence of clinical benefit.\n\u25cf Following the establishment of a collaboration with Incyte Corporation, this study was altered to evaluate the combination of the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen with retifanlimab (anti-PD-1 antibody similar to KEYTRUDA\u00ae). The combination with KEYTRUDA\u00ae has been discontinued.\n\u25cf A total of 12 patients were treated in the phase I part of the study in combination with retifanlimab. One of then switched from the Keytruda\u00ae combination to the retifanlimab combination.\n\u25cf 50% of the evaluable patients showed disease control (stable disease or a partial response) with the safety profile again excellent.\n\u25cf Dosing in this study is ongoing in the randomized phase II portion, with patients randomized either to receive Bria-IMT\u2122 first for retifanlimab first.\n\u25cf Overall survival data has been evaluated for all patients as of 2023 September 8. The median overall survival is 13.5 months, which compares favorably with literature reports of similar patients where overall survival has been 6.7-9.8 months (see references above).\n\u25cf The data confirms the clinical activity of the Bria-IMT\u2122 regimen in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor and justifies further evaluation in a pivotal registration study.\nAbout Bria-IMT\u2122\nDeveloped and characterized by a team of dedicated scientists and clinicians, Bria-IMT\u2122 (SV-BR-1-GM) is a targeted immunotherapy being developed for the treatment of breast cancer. Bria-IMT\u2122 is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line with features of immune cells and clinically applied as a targeted immunotherapy.\nIn short, Bria-IMT\u2122 immunotherapy is a genetically engineered human breast cancer cell line derived from a grade II tumor which activates the immune system to attack and destroy breast cancer tumors.\nMechanism of Action of Bria-IMT\u2122\nThe mechanism of action of Bria-IMT\u2122 is currently under investigation. It is likely that the expression of certain breast cancer antigens (proteins expressed in breast cancer cells) in Bria-IMT\u2122 generates strong T cell and potentially antibody responses - resulting in recognition and destruction of cancerous cells.37\nBria-IMT\u2122 is designed to secrete GM-CSF, a factor that stimulates components of the immune system. Specifically, GM-CSF activates dendritic cells, the cells that start immune responses. These activated dendritic cells then activate T cells, a key component of the immune system, to recognize the tumor cells as foreign, and eliminate them. To amplify this action, we have combined Bria-IMT\u2122 with other immune system activators including cyclophosphamide (used in low doses to reduce immune suppression), and interferon-\u03b1, a cytokine that further activates the immune system. We believe this approach of simultaneous activation of the immune system via different pathways will improve the immune system response to attack and destroy cancer cells.\nBria-OTS\u2122\nUsing BriaCells novel technology platform and our strong research and development capabilities, BriaCell plans to develop Bria-OTS\u2122, a personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy for breast cancer, and similar immunotherapy cell lines for other cancer indications.\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 is under development as an off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy for advanced breast cancer.\n\u25cf The concept for Bria-OTS\u2122 comes from BriaCells work with Bria-IMT\u2122, where BriaCell noted that if a patient matches Bria-IMT\u2122 in their HLA type, they were more likely to respond.\n\u25cf HLA molecules are the molecules that start immune responses but are polymorphic - i.e. they are different in different people, although some people will share the same HLA molecules (referred to as HLA alleles or HLA types).\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 is made from cell lines that are genetically engineered to expresses the immune boosters GM-CSF and interferon-\u03b1, as well as specific HLA types (a.k.a. alleles).\n\u25cf Different cell lines are being pre-manufactured to express different HLA types covering >99% of the overall breast cancer patient population.\n\u25cf Using the BriaDX\u2122, a companion diagnostic test performed on the patients saliva, the suitable personalized treatment will be selected for each patient for administration.\n\u25cf This approach allows personalized treatment without the need for personalized manufacturing. Additionally, it saves time, and skips expensive and complicated manufacturing procedures associated with other personalized treatments.\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 cell lines are being engineered and transferred to good manufacturing practice (GMP) production and clinical evaluation is planned to commence in 2023 (expected authorization by FDA and expected first patient to be dosed in 2023) with safety and efficacy data expected to be released during 2023 and 2024.\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 cell lines have also been engineered to express co-stimulatory molecules and additional cytokines that can activate na\u00efve T cells (those that have not been pre-activated). These Bria-OTS\u2122 2.0 cells are expected to be very potent in eliciting an anticancer immune response.\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 2.0 cell lines for breast cancer and prostate cancer cells should be entering GMP manufacturing in 2023 or early 2024. Similar cell lines for lung cancer and melanoma will follow.\n\u25cf Bria-OTS\u2122 2.0 cell lines have the potential to transform cancer treatment as with simple intradermal injections tailored to the individual patient, a potent and broad immune response against their cancer can be elicited, which should result in marked destruction of the tumors by the patients own immune system.\nLacher M.D., Bauer G.

Frontiers in Immunology 2018; 9: Article 776.\nDevelopment of Additional Immunotherapy Cell Lines\n\u25cf Based on these observations, BriaCell is extending this technology to other types of cancer by developing additional immunotherapy cell lines.\n\u25cf Cell lines currently being genetically engineered include a breast cancer cell line, a prostate cancer cell line, a non-small cell lung cancer cell line and a melanoma cell line.\n\u25cf The genetic engineering has been completed for the breast cancer cell line and GMP manufacturing completed. Release testing is underway with the goal to initiate clinical studies in 2H2023. The prostate cancer cell line is expected to initiate GMP manufacturing in late 2023 or early 2024 with the lung cancer and melanoma cell lines to follow.\n\u25cf IND filings for these immunotherapy cell lines are anticipated starting in 2023.\nEarly Phase Programs\nOn August 4, 2022, BriaCell announced that it has secured an exclusive license from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) to develop and commercialize Soluble CD80 (sCD80) as a biologic agent for the treatment of cancer. Under the terms of the agreement, BriaCell has the worldwide rights to develop and commercialize sCD80, while UMBC maintains ownership of the patents. BriaCell will pay royalties to UMBC upon the commercialization of the product plus patent management costs. The licensing agreement was coordinated by UMBCs Office of Technology Development.\nThe patents are listed as the following: USPN 8,956,619 B2; USPN 9,650,429 B2; USPN 10,377,810 B2\nCD80 is an important co-stimulatory molecule present on antigen-presenting cells and key for activating T cells. CD80 also acts as an immune checkpoint inhibitor. As noted in the patents, significant data has been generated showing that in animal models sCD80 is capable of enhancing anti-cancer immune responses and shrinking tumors in model systems. The sCD80 appears to act both as an immune stimulator and checkpoint inhibitor. This makes it an ideal candidate to combine with BriaCellss cellular immunotherapy platform.\nCurrent timelines project that the sCD80 may be ready to enter the clinic in early 2025.\nMarketing and Sales Strategy\nThe product will initially be marketed to oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy for cancer. Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market combinations with a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. This study will utilize a frozen formulation which consists of irradiated SV-BR-1-GM cells in viable freezing media. This formulation will permit stockpiling of immunotherapy so that it can be sent on demand to clinical sites. The eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat late-stage breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology space.\nOther Commercial Considerations\nThere is a high unmet medical need in late-stage breast cancer, providing potential for accelerated approval of Bria-IMT\u2122. The FDA is interested in facilitating the availability of novel therapies of patients with unmet medical needs, especially those that can target the population most likely to respond. In addition, the FDA has granted Fast Track status to BriaCells lead candidate, Bria-IMT\u2122, for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. These two facts may help facilitate the accelerated approval of Bria-IMT\u2122.\nProduction and Marketing Plan\nBria-IMT\u2122 cells grow in simple tissue culture media and are irradiated prior to inoculation. Bria-IMT\u2122 manufacturing will be performed by Contract Manufacturing Organizations. We have been working with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (KBI) and the University of California, Davis Health System (UC Davis) GMP facility, who have developed a frozen formulation where the cells are grown, harvested and irradiated, followed by cryopreservation in a viable state. The cells are stockpiled and shipped directly to clinical sites for inoculation. Each lot of Bria-IMT\u2122 is tested for potency (i.e. GM-CSF production), identity (i.e. HER2+ and ER/PR-) and adventitious agents to rule out contamination with infectious agents. To date, there have been no issues with these tests. Additional manufacturing facilities have been evaluated and may be enlisted as demand grows.\nMarketing will target oncologists who are well-versed in the use of immunotherapy and especially breast cancer treatment centers. The initial target will be patients with metastatic or recurrent breast cancer who have failed at least two prior treatment regimens. We plan to develop the clinical data for Bria-IMT\u2122 and to use this information to reach out to oncologists seeking additional therapeutic options for their patients. We will include in this effort a physician education campaign targeting the oncologists most likely to treat metastatic breast cancer. As these physicians become more aware of the data regarding Bria-IMT\u2122 in breast cancer, we will make sure they also understand how best to use Bria-IMT\u2122 in combination with other therapies that have complementary synergistic mechanisms of action. This will also come from the clinical studies described above focusing on combination therapy. Partnering with other pharmaceutical companies in order to market a number of drugs is also an option that we intend to pursue. Our eventual goal is to reach all oncologists who treat late stage breast cancer, either by direct outreach or by partnering with another company that has an established presence in the oncology space.\nLicense Agreements\nOn August 4, 2022, BriaCell announced that it has secured an exclusive license from University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) to develop and commercialize Soluble CD80 (sCD80) as a biologic agent for the treatment of cancer.

The Company seeks patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for its current and future product candidates it may develop through other technology. In order to protect its proprietary technologies, the Company relies on combinations of applications for patent and trade secret protection, as well as confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, and third parties.\nThe Company has filed and own or have licensed all rights in the following pending patent applications and issued patents:\nFiled with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on June 14, 2004, U.S. Patent No. 7,674,456 B2, includes claims to the following:\n1. Compositions comprising SV-BR-1 cells\n2. Therapeutic methods of using said compositions\nOn February 27, 2017, BriaCell\u2122 filed an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) to further expand its intellectual property portfolio underlying the Companys current and anticipated pipeline of whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics including Bria-IMT\u2122 and Bria-OTS\u2122. The PCT application (PCT/US2017/019757) claims priority to two provisional patent applications filed by the Company with the USPTO in 2016. It, in essence, provides the framework for additional whole-cell cancer immunotherapeutics beyond Bria-IMT\u2122 and strategies for patient-specific selection of the most likely effective whole-cell immunotherapeutic (BriaDx\u2122). The PCT application entered the National Phase in the second half of 2018 and was granted in Japan on June 21, 2021.\nBriaCell was recently awarded an Australian patent (Patent No. 2017224232, extends to February 27, 2037) covering composition of matter and method of use for its whole-cell cancer immunotherapy technology in Australia.).\nBriaCell has also received an Issue Notification from the USPTO for the composition of matter and method of use of its personalized off-the-shelf cell-based immunotherapy for cancer. The patent was issued on January 24, 2023 as US Patent No. 11,559,574 B2 with the term extending to May 25, 2040.\nOn July 24, 2017, BriaCell obtained the exclusive license to certain patents related to PKC\u03b4 inhibitor technology, including patents to specific compounds, methods of using the compounds, and methods of assessing patients regarding the compounds. These patents include U.S. Patent No. 9,364,460, which was issued on June 14, 2016; U.S. Patent No. 9,572,793, which issued on February 21, 2017; U.S. Patent No. 9,844,534, which was issued December 19, 2017; and EP Patent No. 2897610, which was issued on January 10, 2018.\nTo the knowledge of the Companys management, there are no contested proceedings or third-party claims over any of our patent applications. Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies through intellectual property agreements including patents, trademarks, know-how, and confidentiality agreements. However, there can be no assurance that the above-mentioned patent applications will be approved by the appropriate agencies.\nAll of the technology for which patents are currently sought is owned by the Company. Our patents are entirely owned or exclusively licensed by the Company.\nCompetition\nCancer immunotherapy has become a significant growth area for the biopharmaceutical industry, attracting large pharmaceutical companies as well as small niche players. Generally, our principal competitors in the cancer immunotherapy market comprise both companies with currently approved products for various indications, such as manufacturers of approved bispecific antibodies, CAR-T cells, and checkpoint inhibitors, as well as companies currently engaged in cancer immunotherapy clinical development. The large and medium-size players who have successfully obtained approval for cancer immunotherapy products include Bristol-Myers Squib Company, Merck & Co., Inc., Genentech, Inc. (a subsidiary of Roche Holding AG), AstraZeneca PLC, Celgene Corporation, Johnson & Johnson/Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, Novartis, Acerta Pharmaceuticals (a subsidiary of AstraZeneca), Juno Therapeutics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Celgene), Kite Pharma, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gilead Sciences, Inc. and Pfizer, Inc./EMD Serono, Inc. Most of these companies, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources than does BriaCell.\nCompanies developing novel products with similar indications to those we are pursuing are expected to influence our ability to penetrate and maintain market share. For patients with early stage breast cancer, adjuvant therapy is often given to prevent recurrence and increase the chance of long-term disease-free survival. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or combinations thereof. In addition, the HER2 targeted drug trastuzumab (HERCEPTIN), alone or in combination with pertuzumab (PERJETA), both manufactured and marketed by Roche/Genentech, may be given to patients with tumors with high expression of HER2 (IHC 3+), as well as other novel targets such as MUC1, which may be useful in treating breast cancer. In addition, the FDA approved the first ever immunotherapy regimen for breast cancer to the Roche/Genentech PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ), combined with Celgenes nab-paclitaxel (ABRAXANE) for TNBC that cannot be removed with surgery and is locally advanced or metastatic.\nThere are a number of cancer vaccines in development for breast cancer, including but not limited to TPIV200 (Marker Therapeutics, Inc.), AE-37 (Antigen Express), and Stimuvax (Merck KgA). While these development candidates are aimed at a number of different targets, and AE-37 has published data in the HER2 breast cancer patient population, there is no guarantee that any of these compounds will not in the future be indicated for treatment of low-to-intermediate HER2 breast cancer patients and become directly competitive with NPS.\nMany of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do, and also have greater experience in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and commercializing those treatments. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for cancer immunotherapy products and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors treatments may be more effectively marketed and sold than any products we may commercialize, thus causing limited market share before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing of our cancer immunotherapy product candidate.\nMergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These activities may lead to consolidated efforts that allow for more rapid development of cancer immunotherapy product candidates.\nThese competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, the ability to work with specific clinical contract organizations due to conflicts of interest, and the conduct of trials in the ability to recruit clinical trial sites and subjects for our clinical trials.\nWe expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are viewed as safer, more convenient or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our current product candidates or any other future product candidate, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this filing, we had eleven full-time employees and one part-time employee, located in various US states including: NY, CA, PA, SC, HI, and NJ. We also have international employees located in Canada and Israel.\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, the average number of employees has been sixteen, of whom four were executive management (July 31, 2022 - eight).\nResearch and Development Activities and Costs\nFor information regarding our clinical studies, please see above under the caption Description of the Business - Clinical Trials.\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, we incurred $14,264,048 and $7,585,926, respectively, of net research and development expenses (excluding share based compensation allocated to research and development employees)\nManufacturing\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of our product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, active pharmaceutical ingredients, and finished product candidate for our clinical trials. We currently employ internal resources and third-party consultants to manage our manufacturing contractors.\nBria-IMT\u2122 is currently manufactured under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) pursuant to agreements with UC Davis and with KBI, which is located in The Woodlands, Texas.\nOn June 11, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement for Services with The Regents of the University of California, acting for and on behalf of UC Davis, pursuant to which UC Davis manufactures Bria-IMT\u2122 (previously known as BriaVax) at its GMP facility. The Company pays UC Davis certain hourly rates depending on the specific services provided by UC Davis in connection with its manufacturing of Bria-IMT\u2122.\nPursuant to the Companys master services agreement with KBI, dated March 17, 2017, KBI has conducted developmental studies to derive and optimize a cryopreserved formulation of Bria-IMT\u2122 (previously known as BriaVax) as a research working cell bank of final drug product doses suitable for cold chain shipment (the KBI Services). The Company pays for the cost of materials, consumables, and third party services, plus an additional 5% fee to compensate KBI for the cost of purchasing, material handling, inventory and administration and management of third party services necessary for KBI to perform the KBI Services. The master services agreement with KBI terminates on May 4, 2027.\nOn July 5, 2022, BriaCell announced that it had entered into a manufacturing service agreement with Waisman Biomanufacturing at the University of Wisconsin-Madison (Waisman), to manufacture Bria-Pros\u2122, BriaCells off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapy for prostate cancer, for anticipated use in clinical studies. Waisman is a leading contract manufacturing organization with experience in the manufacturing of cellular therapies for clinical trials. Under the terms of the agreement, Waisman will be responsible for GMP manufacturing of Bria-Pros\u2122 for anticipated use in clinical studies. Waismans expert team will be working closely with BriaCells scientific and product development teams to ensure timely production of Bria-Pros\u2122 in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements by the FDA.\nSales and Marketing\nOur future commercial strategy may include the use of strategic partners, distributors, a contract sale force, or the establishment of our own commercial and specialty sales force, as well as similar strategies for regions and territories outside the United States. We plan to further evaluate these alternatives as we approach approval for the use of our product candidates for one or more indications.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Company does not own any real property. BriaCells corporate offices in Canada are located at Suite 300, Bellevue Centre, 235-15th Street, West Vancouver, BC V7T 2XI, and its corporate and research offices in the United States are located at 2929 Arch Street 3rd Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104.\nWe consider our current office space sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for the foreseeable future and suitable for the conduct of our business.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. Along with third-party contractors, we will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our current or future product candidates. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local, and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label.\nThe process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:\n\u25cf completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDAs current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;\n\u25cf submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application (IND), which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;\n\u25cf approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (IRB) or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is begun;\n\u25cf performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;\n\u25cf preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (BLA), after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;\n\u25cf satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;\n\u25cf a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;\n\u25cf satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological products continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigations to assess compliance with current Good Clinical Practices (GCP); and\n\u25cf FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States, which must be updated annually when significant changes are made.\nThe testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our current or future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.\nClinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments. Furthermore, an IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by a Data & Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) organized by the clinical trial sponsor, which provides authorization for whether or not a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial, and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects, or based on other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical trial results to public registries.\nFor purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.\n\u25cf Phase 1-The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.\n\u25cf Phase 2-The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. In some cases, FDA will grant preliminary marketing authorization for drugs treating areas of high unmet medical need based on Phase 2 clinical trials. If granted, they will also require confirmatory Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing. BriaCell is evaluating Bria-IMT in patients with breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this population there is no approved therapy. Therefore, the development plan for Bria-IMT is an area of high unmet medical need. It is anticipated that BriaCell will not need to complete Phase 3 clinical trials prior to submitting the marketing application for Bria-IMT in patients with advanced breast cancer who have failed at least two prior lines of therapy. In this case, a confirmatory Phase 3 evaluation post-marketing will be required. It is anticipated that this would consist of a randomized, controlled clinical trial of Bria-IMT in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors compared with best available therapy. However, this design is subject to negotiation with the FDA.\n\u25cf Phase 3-The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.\n\u25cf Phase 4-In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA.\nPhase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within a specified period, if at all, and there can be no assurance that the data collected will support FDA approval or licensure of the product. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.\nBLA Submission and Review by the FDA\nAssuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things. Data can come from company-sponsored clinical studies intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a use of the product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial user fee to FDA, and the sponsor of an approved BLA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. A waiver of user fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.\nOnce a BLA has been submitted, the FDAs goal is to review the application within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.\nThe testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all, and we may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals, which could delay or preclude us from marketing our products. After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A Complete Response Letter may request additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.\nIf regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy plan to mitigate risks, which could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDAs policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.\nA sponsor may seek approval of its product candidate under programs designed to accelerate FDAs review and approval of new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. For a product candidate with Fast Track designation, the FDA may consider sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if relevant criteria are met. A Fast Track designated product candidate may also qualify for priority review, under which the FDA sets the target date for FDA action on the BLA at six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review is granted when there is evidence that the proposed product would be a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of a serious condition. If criteria are not met for priority review, the application is subject to the standard FDA review period of 10 months after FDA accepts the application for filing. Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.\nUnder the Accelerated Approval program, the FDA may approve a BLA on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Post-marketing studies or completion of ongoing studies after marketing approval are generally required to verify the biologics clinical benefit in relationship to the surrogate endpoint or ultimate outcome in relationship to the clinical benefit.\nIn addition, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of its product candidate as a Breakthrough Therapy, if the product candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the therapy may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If the FDA designates a breakthrough therapy, it may take actions appropriate to expedite the development and review of the application. Breakthrough designation also allows the sponsor to file sections of the BLA for review on a rolling basis.\nFast Track, Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designations do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.\nOther Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements\nOur sales, promotion, medical education and other activities following product approval will be subject to regulation by numerous regulatory and law enforcement authorities in the United States in addition to the FDA, including potentially the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, and state and local governments. Our promotional and scientific/educational programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the False Claims Act (FCA), the Veterans Health Care Act, physician payment transparency laws, privacy laws, security laws, and additional state laws similar to the foregoing.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, the offer, receipt, or payment of remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of patients or the use of products or services that would be paid for in whole or part by Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs. Remuneration has been broadly defined to include anything of value, including cash, improper discounts, and free or reduced price items and services. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham research or consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. Many states have similar laws that apply to their state health care programs as well as private payors.\nThe FCA imposes liability on persons who, among other things, present or cause to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal health care program. The FCA has been used to prosecute persons submitting claims for payment that are inaccurate or fraudulent, that are for services not provided as claimed, or for services that are not medically necessary. Actions under the FCA may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the FCA can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. For example, the federal government is using the FCA, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the country, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multibillion dollar settlements under the FCA in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. In addition, companies have been forced to implement extensive corrective action plans, and have often become subject to consent decrees or corporate integrity agreements, restricting the manner in which they conduct their business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers and manufacturers compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Affordable Care Act), among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments or other transfers of value made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians and other healthcare professionals.\nWe may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH) and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increases the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gives state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation.\nCoverage and Reimbursement\nSales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our product candidates. Seeking coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors can be time consuming and expensive. Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.\nForeign Regulation\nIn addition to regulations in the United States, we are and will be subject, either directly or through our distribution partners, to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved.\nWhether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in non-U.S. countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have processes that require the submission of a clinical trial application much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (CTA) must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company plans to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a countrys requirements, clinical trials may proceed in that country.\nThe requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country, even though there is already some degree of legal harmonization in the European Union (the E.U.) member states resulting from the national implementation of underlying E.U. legislation. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and other applicable regulatory requirements.\nTo obtain regulatory approval of a new drug or medicinal product in the E.U., a sponsor must obtain approval of a marketing authorization application. The way in which a medicinal product can be approved in the E.U. depends on the nature of the medicinal product.\nThe centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization granted by the European Commission that is valid across the E.U., as well as in Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human drugs that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) officially designated as orphan drugs and (iv) advanced-therapy medicines, such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used for human drugs which do not fall within the above mentioned categories if the human drug (a) contains a new active substance which was not authorized in the European Community; or (b) the applicant shows that the medicinal product constitutes a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or that the granting of authorization in the centralized procedure is in the interests of patients or animal health at the European Community level.\nUnder the centralized procedure in the E.U., the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application by the EMA is 210 days (excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)), with adoption of the actual marketing authorization by the European Commission thereafter. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest from the point of view of therapeutic innovation, defined by three cumulative criteria: (i) the seriousness of the disease to be treated, (ii) the absence of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach, and (iii) anticipation of exceptional high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the evaluation for the opinion of the CHMP is completed within 150 days and the opinion issued thereafter.\nThe Mutual Recognition Procedure (MRP) for the approval of human drugs is an alternative approach to facilitate individual national marketing authorizations within the E.U. The MRP may be applied for all human drugs for which the centralized procedure is not obligatory. The MRP is applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products, and is based on the principle of recognition of an already existing national marketing authorization by one or more member states.\nThe characteristic of the MRP is that the procedure builds on an already existing marketing authorization in a member state of the E.U. that is used as reference in order to obtain marketing authorizations in other E.U. member states. In the MRP, a marketing authorization for a drug already exists in one or more member states of the E.U. and subsequently marketing authorization applications are made in other E.U. member states by referring to the initial marketing authorization. The member state in which the marketing authorization was first granted will then act as the reference member state. The member states where the marketing authorization is subsequently applied for act as concerned member states.\nThe MRP is based on the principle of the mutual recognition by E.U. member states of their respective national marketing authorizations. Based on a marketing authorization in the reference member state, the applicant may apply for marketing authorizations in other member states. In such case, the reference member state shall update its existing assessment report about the drug in 90 days. After the assessment is completed, copies of the report are sent to all member states, together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. The concerned member states then have 90 days to recognize the decision of the reference member state and the summary of product characteristics, labeling and package leaflet. National marketing authorizations shall be granted within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.\nShould any E.U. member state refuse to recognize the marketing authorization by the reference member state, on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the issue will be referred to a coordination group. Within a timeframe of 60 days, member states shall, within the coordination group, make all efforts to reach a consensus. If this fails, the procedure is submitted to an EMA scientific committee for arbitration. The opinion of this EMA Committee is then forwarded to the Commission, for the start of the decision-making process. As in the centralized procedure, this process entails consulting various European Commission Directorates General and the Standing Committee on Human Medicinal Products or Veterinary Medicinal Products, as appropriate.\nFor other countries outside of the E.U., such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the other applicable regulatory requirements.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.\nPlan of Arrangement\nOn August 31, 2023, the Company closed a plan of arrangement spinout transaction (the Arrangement). Pursuant to the Arrangement, certain pipeline assets of the Company were spun-out to BriaPro Therapeutics Corp. (BriaPro or SpinCo), including Bria-TILsRx\u2122 and protein kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4) inhibitors for multiple indications including cancer (the BriaPro Assets), resulting in a two-third (2/3) owned subsidiary of the Company with the remaining one-third (1/3) held by the Companys shareholders. BriaPro has acquired the entire right and interest in and to the BriaPro Assets in consideration for the issuance by BriaPro to the Company of BriaPros common shares. Under the terms of the Arrangement, for each common share of the Company held immediately prior to closing, the shareholders of the Company received one common share of BriaPro, and one new common share of the Company (retiring their old share) having the same terms and characteristics as the existing common shares of the Company. The Companys common shares and public warrants remained listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the common shares remained listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, and SpinCo is an unlisted reporting issuer in Canada. As part of the Arrangement, the Company obtained a third-party independent valuation for BriaPro which amounted to $1.75 million. Based on the number of issued shares of BriaPro, this amounts to $0.0365 per BriaPro share.\nBriaPro is a pre-clinical stage immunotherapy company developing binding agents and proteins with the intention to boost the ability of the bodys own cancer-fighting cells to destroy cancerous tumors. Using artificial intelligence (AI) with ImmunoPrecise Antibodies and Receptor AI, BriaPro will identify drug candidates.\nThe lead drug discovery candidates for BriaPro includes:\n\u25cf Bria-TILsRx\u2122: Multi-Specific Binding Reagents - Immunotherapy for Cancer: being developed in collaboration with ImmunoPrecise Antibodies.\n\u25cf Small Molecule Program: Protein Kinase C delta (PKC\u03b4) Inhibitors being developed with Receptor AI.\nThe power of AI in drug candidate selection has been hailed by experts and investments in AI-driven drug discovery companies have tripled over the past four years, reaching $24.6 billion in 2022.2 Using AI technology to identify the next blockbuster therapies can help eliminate some of the guesswork that typically requires hundreds of lab experiments-often spread over many years-to identify promising molecules.\nInstead of coming up with tens of thousands of compounds to figure out, computers suggest testing ten compounds in a lab, then getting feedback from the lab results. The machines learn from those results to make a better prediction to provide the next hundred candidates for testing and ultimately filter to one molecule.\nOver the course of the next year, BriaPro expects to screen several different multi specific binding reagents for activity in vitro as well as in mouse models of cancer. BriaPro also expects to select at least one candidate to advance into IND enabling studies. Human clinical studies are expected to be initiated in the first half of 2025. In parallel, BriaPro will continue to optimize the structure of its proprietary protein kinase C delta inhibitors and advance to the candidates election stage. Human clinical studies are expected to be initiated in the second half of 2025.\nRecent Developments\nOn May 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Master Service and Technology Agreement (the MST Agreement) with Prevail InfoWorks, Inc. (InfoWorks) pursuant to which InfoWorks will provide clinical services and technologies for the Companys upcoming pivotal study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. The Company has agreed to pay InfoWorks $5,379,945 upon signing of the MST Agreement and pay InfoWorks additional fees upon the achievement of certain milestones.\nOn May 12, 2023, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement (the Prevail Partners Purchase Agreement) with Prevail Partners, LLC, an investment fund and affiliate of InfoWorks, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue 463,408 common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000. The funds received were used to pay amounts owed to InfoWorks under the MST Agreement. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. An investor should carefully consider the risks described below as well as other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected, the value of our securities could decline, and investors in our company may lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses, may incur future losses and may not achieve profitability\nBriaCell is a development stage immune-oncology biotechnology corporation that to date has not recorded any revenues from the sale of diagnostic or therapeutic products. Since incorporation, BriaCell has accumulated net losses and expects such losses to continue as it commences product and pre-clinical development and eventually enters into license agreements for its technology. We incurred net losses of $20,302,394 and $26,838,903 in the fiscal years ended 2023 and 2022, respectively. Management expects to continue to incur substantial operating losses unless and until such time as product sales generate sufficient revenues to fund continuing operations. BriaCell has neither a history of earnings nor has it paid any dividends, and it is unlikely to pay dividends or enjoy earnings in the immediate or foreseeable future.\nWe are a pre-revenue clinical stage company\nThe Company is developing novel technologies that may not be efficacious or safe. The Company expects to spend a significant amount of capital to fund research and development. As a result, the Company expects that its operating expenses will increase significantly and, consequently, it will need to generate significant revenues to become profitable. Even if the Company does become profitable, it may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. The Company cannot predict when, if ever, it will be profitable. There can be no assurances that the intellectual property of BriaCell, or other technologies it may acquire, will meet applicable regulatory standards, obtain required regulatory approvals, be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable costs, or be successfully marketed. The Company will be undertaking additional laboratory studies or trials with respect to the intellectual property of BriaCell, and there can be no assurance that the results from such studies or trials will result in a commercially viable product or will not identify unwanted side effects.\nWe have an unproven market for our product candidates\nThe Company believes that the anticipated market for its potential products and technologies if successfully developed will continue to exist and expand. These assumptions may prove to be incorrect for a variety of reasons, including competition from other products and the degree of commercial viability of the potential product.\nWe may not succeed in adapting to and meeting the business needs associated with our anticipated growth\nAnticipated growth in all areas of BriaCells business is expected to continue to place a significant strain on its managerial, operational and technical resources. The Company expects operating expenses and staffing levels to increase in the future. To manage such growth, the Company must expand its operational and technical capabilities and manage its employee base while effectively administering multiple relationships with various third parties. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to manage its expanding operations effectively. Any failure to implement cohesive management and operating systems, to add resources on a cost-effective basis or to properly manage the Companys expansion could have a material adverse effect on its business and results of operations.\nBriaPro may not generate revenue as expected\nWe are a majority shareholder of BriaPro. BriaPro may not generate financial returns or may not yield the desired business outcome. The success of our investment in a company is sometimes dependent on the availability of additional funding on favorable terms or a liquidity event such as an initial public offering. We may record impairment charges in relation to our strategic investments which will have a negative impact on our financial position.\nThis may expose us to additional reputational, financial, legal, compliance or operational risks. This could impact our return on our investment. In the event BriaPro fails to generate revenue, this may erode or dilute its value to our shareholders.\nWe are heavily reliant on third-parties to carry out a large portion of our business\nThe Company does not expect to have any in-house manufacturing, pharmaceutical development or marketing capability. To be successful, a product must be manufactured and packaged in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and in reasonable time frames and at accepted costs. The Company intends to contract with third parties to develop its products. No assurance can be given that the Company or its suppliers will be able to meet the supply requirements in respect of the product development or commercial sales.\nProduction of therapeutic products may require raw materials for which the sources and amount of supply are limited, or may be hindered by quality or scheduling issues in respect of the third party suppliers over which the Company has limited control. An inability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials could significantly delay the development, regulatory approval and marketing of a product. The Company has limited in-house personnel to internally manage all aspects of product development, including the management of multi-center clinical trials. The Company is significantly reliant on third-party consultants and contractors to provide the requisite advice and management. There can be no assurance that the clinical trials and product development will not encounter delays which could adversely affect prospects for the Companys success.\nTo be successful, an approved product must also be successfully marketed. The market for the Companys product being developed by the Company may be large and will require substantial sales and marketing capability. At the present time, the Company does not have any internal capability to market pharmaceutical products. The Company intends to enter into one or more strategic partnerships or collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or other companies with marketing and distribution expertise to address this need. If necessary, the Company will establish arrangements with various partners for geographical areas. There can be no assurance that the Company can market, or can enter into a satisfactory arrangement with a third party to market a product in a manner that would assure its acceptance in the marketplace. However, if a satisfactory arrangement with a third party to market and/or distribute a product is obtained; the Company will be dependent on the corporate collaborator(s) who may not devote sufficient time, resources and attention to the Companys programs, which may hinder efforts to market the products.\nShould the Company not establish marketing and distribution strategic partnerships and collaborative arrangements on acceptable terms, and undertake some or all of those functions, the Company will require significant additional human and financial resources and expertise to undertake these activities, the availability of which is not guaranteed. The Company will rely on third parties for the timely supply of raw materials, equipment, contract manufacturing, and formulation or packaging services. Although the Company intends to manage these third-party relationships to ensure continuity and quality, some events beyond the Companys control could result in complete or partial failure of these goods and services. Any such failure could have a material adverse effect on the financial conditions and result of operation of the Company.\nDue to the complexity of the process of developing pharmaceutical products, the Companys business may depend on arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, corporate and academic collaborators, licensors, licensees and others for the research, development, clinical testing, technology rights, manufacturing, marketing and commercialization of its products. Such agreements could obligate the Company to diligently bring potential products to market, make milestone payments and royalties that, in some instances, could be substantial, and incur the costs of filing and prosecuting patent applications. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to establish or maintain collaborations that are important to its business on favorable terms, or at all.\nA number of risks arise from the Companys potential dependence on collaborative agreements with third parties. Product development and commercialization efforts could be adversely affected if any collaborative partner terminates or suspends its agreement with the Company, causes delays, fails to on a timely basis develop or manufacture in adequate quantities a substance needed in order to conduct clinical trials, fails to adequately perform clinical trials, determines not to develop, manufacture or commercialize a product to which it has rights, or otherwise fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Companys collaborative partners could pursue other technologies or develop alternative products that could compete with the products the Company is developing.\nThe Company has signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA) with many different third parties. As is customary in the industry. There is no guarantee that, despite the terms of the NDA which bind third parties, the Company will ultimately be able to prevent from such third parties from breaching their obligations under the NDA. Use of the Companys confidential information in an unauthorized manner is likely to negatively affect the Company.\nPre-clinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future results\nPre-clinical tests and Phase I/II clinical trials are primarily designed to test safety, to study pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and to understand the side effects of product candidates at various doses and schedules. Success in pre-clinical and early clinical trials does not ensure that later large-scale efficacy trials will be successful, nor does it predict final results. Favorable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials.\nA number of companies in the life sciences industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after positive results in earlier trials. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be delayed, repeated or terminated. Any pre-clinical data and the clinical results obtained for BriaCells technology may not predict results from studies in larger numbers of subjects drawn from more diverse populations or in the commercial setting, and also may not predict the ability of our products to achieve their intended goals, or to do so safely.\nAn inability to obtain raw materials or product supply could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations\nRaw materials and supplies are generally available in quantities to meet the needs of the Companys business. The Company will be dependent on third-party manufacturers for the pharmaceutical products that it markets An inability to obtain raw materials or product supply could have a material adverse impact on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe must obtain additional capital to continue our operations\nThe Company anticipates that additional capital will be required to complete its current research and development programs. It is anticipated that future research, additional pre-clinical and toxicology studies and manufacturing initiatives, including to prepare for market approval and successful product market launch, will require additional funds. Further financing may dilute the current holdings of shareholders and may thereby result in a loss for the shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain adequate financing, or financing on terms that are reasonable or acceptable for these or other purposes, or to fulfill the Companys obligations under various license agreements. Failure to obtain such additional financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further research and development of the Companys technologies with the possible loss of license rights to these technologies.\nWe are highly dependent on our key personnel\nAlthough the Company is expected to have experienced senior management and personnel, the Company will be substantially dependent upon the services of a few key personnel, particularly Dr. William V. Williams, Dr. Giuseppe Del Priore, Dr. Miguel Lopez-Lago and other professionals for the successful operation of its business. Phase I of the Companys research and development is planned to be completed by qualified professionals and is expected to concentrate on treatment of advanced breast cancer. The loss of the services of any of these personnel could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. The Company may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among high technology enterprises, including biotechnology and healthcare companies, universities and non-profit research institutions. If we lose any of these persons, or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nBriaCell in the future may acquire businesses, products or technologies that it believes complement or expand its existing business.\nAcquisitions of this type involve a number of risks, including the possibility that the operations of the acquired business will not be profitable or that the attention of the Companys management will be diverted from the day-to-day operation of its business. An unsuccessful acquisition could reduce the Companys margins or otherwise harm its financial condition.\nIf the Company experiences a data security breach and confidential information is disclosed, the Company may be subject to penalties and experience negative publicity\nThe Company and its customers could suffer harm if personal and health information were accessed by third parties due to a system security failure. The collection of data requires the Company to receive and store a large amount of personally identifiable data. Recently, data security breaches suffered by well-known companies and institutions have attracted a substantial amount of media attention, prompting legislative proposals addressing data privacy and security. The Company may become exposed to potential liabilities with respect to the data that it collects, manages and processes, and may incur legal costs if information security policies and procedures are not effective or if the Company is required to defend its methods of collection, processing and storage of personal data. Future investigations, lawsuits or adverse publicity relating to its methods of handling such information could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations due to the costs and negative market reaction relating to such developments.\nWe may not succeed in completing the development of our products, commercializing our products or generating significant revenues\nSince commencing our operations, we have focused on the research and development and limited clinical trials of our product candidates. Our ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully complete the development of our products, obtain market approval and generate significant revenues. The future success of our business cannot be determined at this time, and we do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future. In addition, we face a number of challenges with respect to our future commercialization efforts, including, among others, that:\n\u25cf we may not have adequate financial or other resources to complete the development of our product, including two stages of clinical development that are necessary in order to commercialize our products;\n\u25cf we may not be able to manufacture our products in commercial quantities, at an adequate quality or at an acceptable cost;\n\u25cf we may not be able to maintain our CE mark due to regulatory changes;\n\u25cf we may never receive FDA or Health Canada approval for our intended development plans;\n\u25cf we may not be able to establish adequate sales, marketing and distribution channels;\n\u25cf healthcare professionals and patients may not accept our product candidates;\n\u25cf technological breakthroughs in cancer detection, treatment and prevention may reduce the demand for our product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in the market for cancer treatment, new alliances between existing market participants and the entrance of new market participants may interfere with our market penetration efforts;\n\u25cf third-party payors may not agree to reimburse patients for any or all of the purchase price of our products, which may adversely affect patients willingness to purchase our product candidates;\n\u25cf uncertainty as to market demand may result in inefficient pricing of our product candidates;\n\u25cf we may face third-party claims of intellectual property infringement;\n\u25cf we may fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products candidates in our target markets or may face adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our product candidates even if regulatory approval is obtained; and\n\u25cf we are dependent upon the results of ongoing clinical studies relating to our product candidates and the products of our competitors. We may fail in obtaining positive results.\nIf we are unable to meet any one or more of these challenges successfully, our ability to effectively commercialize our product candidates could be limited, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and the commercialization of our drug candidates may be affected\nAs our drug candidates are currently in clinical trials, we face an inherent risk of product liability suits and will face an even greater risk if we obtain approval to commercialize any drugs. For example, we may be sued if our drug candidates cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the drug, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our drug candidates. Even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for our drugs;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf withdrawal of clinical trial participants and inability to continue clinical trials;\n\u25cf initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u25cf costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u25cf diversion of managements time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf loss of revenue;\n\u25cf exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize any drug candidate; and\n\u25cf a decline in the price of our common shares.\nWe believe that we currently have appropriate insurance covering clinical trials. However, it may transpire that the amount of such insurance coverage may not be adequate, we may be unable to maintain such insurance, or we may not be able to obtain additional or replacement insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. Any inability to maintain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of drugs we develop, alone or with collaborators. Our insurance policies may also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. We may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts. Even if our agreements with any future corporate collaborators entitle us to indemnification against losses, such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise.\nAdditionally, we may be sued if the products that we commercialize, market or sell cause or are perceived to cause injury or are found to be otherwise unsuitable, and may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for those products;\n\u25cf damage to our reputation;\n\u25cf costs incurred related to product recalls;\n\u25cf limiting our opportunities to enter into future commercial partnerships; and\n\u25cf a decline in the price of our common shares.\nGlobal economic uncertainty and financial market volatility caused by political instability, changes in international trade relationships and conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and rising tensions in the Middle East, could make it more difficult for us to access financing and could adversely affect our business and operations.\nOur ability to raise capital is subject to the risk of adverse changes in the market value of our stock. Periods of macroeconomic weakness or recession and heightened market volatility caused by adverse geopolitical developments could increase these risks, potentially resulting in adverse impacts on our ability to raise further capital on favorable terms. The impact of geopolitical tension, such as rising tensions in the Middle East, a deterioration in the bilateral relationship between the US and China or an escalation in conflict between Russia and Ukraine, including any resulting sanctions, export controls or other restrictive actions that may be imposed by the US and/or other countries against governmental or other entities in, for example, Russia, also could lead to disruption, instability and volatility in global trade patterns, which may in turn impact our ability to source necessary reagents, raw materials and other inputs for our research and development operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by the effects of inflation.\nInflation has the potential to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has the potential to result in higher interest rates and capital costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor and other similar effects. As a result of inflation, we may experience increases in the costs of labor, materials, and other inputs, such as engineering consultants. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation, if these measures are not effective our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost inflation is incurred.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not successfully develop, maintain and protect our proprietary products and technologies\nBriaCells success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to develop, maintain and protect proprietary products and technologies. BriaCell files patent applications in the United States and other countries as part of its global strategy to protect its intellectual property and maintains certain U.S. and Non-U.S. patents in its intellectual property portfolio. However, patents provide only limited protection of BriaCells intellectual property. The assertion of patent protection involves complex legal and factual determinations and is therefore uncertain and can be expensive. BriaCell cannot provide assurances that patents will be granted with respect to any of its pending patent applications, or that the scope of any of its granted patents, or any patents granted in the future, will be sufficiently broad to offer meaningful protection, or that it will develop and file patent applications on additional proprietary technologies that are patentable, or, if patentable, that any patents will be granted from such patent applications. BriaCells current or future patents could be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented. This could result in BriaCells patent rights failing to create an effective competitive barrier. Losing a significant patent or failing to get a patent to issue from a pending patent application that BriaCell considers significant could have a material adverse effect on BriaCells business. The laws governing the scope of patent coverage in various countries continue to evolve. The laws of some foreign countries may not protect BriaCells intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. BriaCell has applied for patent protection only in selected countries. Therefore, third parties may be able to replicate BriaCell technologies covered by BriaCells patent portfolio in countries in which it does not have patent protection.\nBriaCells future success and competitive position depends in part upon its ability to maintain its intellectual property portfolio. There can be no assurance that any patents will be issued on any existing or future patent applications.\nWe are susceptible to intellectual property suits that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our product candidates\nThere is a substantial amount of litigation over patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology industry. Whether or not a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual considerations, the determination of which is often uncertain. Our management is presently unaware of any other parties patents and proprietary rights which our products under development would infringe. Searches typically performed to identify potentially infringed patents of third parties are often not conclusive and, because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications now pending, which may later result in issued patents which our current or future products may infringe or be alleged to infringe. In addition, our competitors or other parties may assert that our product candidates and the methods employed may be covered by patents held by them. If any of our products infringes a valid patent, we could be prevented from manufacturing or selling such product unless we are able to obtain a license or able to redesign the product in such a manner as to avoid infringement. A license may not always be available or may require us to pay substantial royalties. We also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign our product to avoid infringement, nor does a later redesign protect BriaCell from prior infringement. Infringement and other intellectual property claims, with or without merit, can be expensive and time-consuming to litigate and can divert our managements attention from operating our business.\nThe steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the market\nBriaCells ability to establish and maintain a competitive position may be achieved in part by prosecuting claims against others who it believes to be infringing its rights. In addition, enforcement of BriaCells patents in foreign jurisdictions will depend on the legal procedures in those jurisdictions. In addition to filing patent applications, we rely on confidentiality, non-compete, non-disclosure and assignment of inventions provisions, as appropriate, in our agreements with our employees, consultants, and service providers, to protect and otherwise seek to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. These measures may not be adequate to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized disclosure, third-party infringement or misappropriation, for the following reasons:\n\u25cf the agreements may be breached, may not provide the scope of protection we believe they provide or may be determined to be unenforceable;\n\u25cf we may have inadequate remedies for any breach;\n\u25cf proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors; or\n\u25cf others may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies.\nSpecifically, with respect to non-compete agreements, both state law and precedent varies greatly from state to state and we may be unable to enforce these agreements, in whole or in part, and it may be difficult for us to restrict our competitors from gaining the expertise that our former employees gained while working for us. If our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it could harm our ability to protect our rights and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would harm our ability to compete in the market\nWe rely on patents, confidentiality and trade secrets to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical industry can be uncertain. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent and related litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or requests for injunctive relief. BriaCells ability to establish and maintain a competitive position may be achieved in part by prosecuting claims against others who it believes to be infringing its rights. In addition, enforcement of BriaCells patents in foreign jurisdictions will depend on the legal procedures in those jurisdictions. Any lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert our managements attention from other business concerns and the outcome of litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in patents, copyrights, trade secrets or trademarks is highly unpredictable. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing, or adversely affect its ability to distribute any products that are subject to such litigation. In addition, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, including attorney fees, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we or our employees or contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers\nMany of our employees and contractors were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we or any employee or contractor have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of his or her former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. A loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain therapeutic candidates, which could severely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nIf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities approve generic versions of any of our products that receive marketing approval, or such authorities do not grant our products appropriate periods of exclusivity before approving generic versions of our products, the sales of our products could be adversely affected.\nOnce a new drug application is approved, the product covered thereby becomes a reference listed drug in the FDAs publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Manufacturers may seek approval of generic versions of reference listed drugs through submission of abbreviated new drug applications in the United States. In support of an abbreviated new drug applications, a generic manufacturer need not conduct clinical trials. Rather, the applicant generally must show that its product has the same active ingredient(s), dosage form, strength, route of administration and conditions of use or labeling as the reference listed drug and that the generic version is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug, meaning it is absorbed in the body at the same rate and to the same extent. Generic products may be significantly less costly to bring to market than the reference listed drug and companies that produce generic products are generally able to offer them at lower prices. Thus, following the introduction of a generic drug, a significant percentage of the sales of any branded product or reference listed drug is typically lost to the generic product.\nThe FDA may not approve abbreviated new drug applications for a generic product until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provides a period of five years of non-patent exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity (NCE). Specifically, in cases where such exclusivity has been granted, abbreviated new drug applications may not be submitted to the FDA until the expiration of five years, unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification that a patent covering the reference listed drug is either invalid or will not be infringed by the generic product, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following approval of the reference listed drug.\nWhile we believe that our products contain active ingredients that would be treated as NCEs by the FDA and, therefore, if approved, should be afforded five years of data exclusivity, the FDA may disagree with that conclusion and may approve generic products after a period that is less than five years. If the FDA were to award NCE exclusivity to someone other than us, we believe that we would still be awarded three year Other exclusivity protection from generic competition, which is awarded when an application or supplement contains reports of new clinical investigations (not bioavailability studies) conducted or sponsored by an applicant and essential for approval. Manufacturers may seek to launch these generic products following the expiration of the applicable marketing exclusivity period, even if we still have patent protection for our product. If we do not maintain patent protection and data exclusivity for our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nCompetition that our products may face from generic versions of our products could materially and adversely impact our future revenue, profitability and cash flows and substantially limit our ability to obtain a return on the investments we have made in those product candidates.\nPatent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.\nPatents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest United States non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing, and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nRisks Related to Regulations\nChanges in legislation and regulations may affect our revenue and profitability\nExisting and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies may cause the Company to incur increased costs as the Company evaluates the implications of new rules and responds to new requirements. Failure to comply with new rules and regulations could result in enforcement actions or the assessment of other penalties. New laws and regulations could make it more difficult to obtain certain types of insurance, including directors and officers liability insurance, and the Company may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage, to the extent that such coverage remains available.\nThe impact of these events could also make it more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the Board, or as executive officers. The Company may be required to hire additional personnel and utilize additional outside legal, accounting and advisory services, all of which could cause the Companys general and administrative costs to increase beyond what the Company currently has planned. Although the Company evaluates and monitors developments with respect to new rules and laws, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs the Company may incur or the timing of such costs with respect to such evaluations and/or compliance and cannot provide assurances that such additional costs will render the Company compliant with such new rules and laws.\nIf we or our licensees are unable to obtain U.S., Canadian and/or foreign regulatory approval for our product candidates, we will be unable to commercialize our therapeutic candidates\nTo date, we have not marketed, distributed or sold an approved product. Our therapeutic candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to development, clinical trials, manufacturing and commercialization of drugs. We may not obtain marketing approval for any of our therapeutic candidates in a timely manner or at all. In connection with the clinical trials for our product candidates and other therapeutic candidates that we may seek to develop in the future, either on our own or throughout licensing arrangements, we face the risk that:\n\u25cf a product candidate may not prove safe or efficacious;\n\u25cf the results with respect to any product candidate may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u25cf the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, Health Canada or other regulatory authorities; and\n\u25cf the results will justify only limited and/or restrictive uses, including the inclusion of warnings and contraindications, which could significantly limit the marketability and profitability of the therapeutic candidate.\nAny delay or failure in obtaining the required regulatory approvals will materially and adversely affect our ability to generate future revenues from a particular product candidate. Any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product or may impose restrictive conditions of use, including cautionary information, thereby limiting the size of the market for the product. We and our licensees, as applicable, also are, and will be, subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements that govern the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval process that we describe above, as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of foreign requirements. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities outside the United States. Foreign jurisdictions may have different approval processes than those required by the FDA and may impose additional testing requirements for our therapeutic candidates.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for, or commercialize, our product candidates\nWe do not have the ability to independently conduct our clinical trials for our product candidates and we must rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct such trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance for, or successfully commercialize, our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nModifications to our product candidates, or to any other product candidates that we may develop in the future, may require new regulatory clearances or approvals or may require us or our licensees, as applicable, to recall or cease marketing these therapeutic candidates until clearances are obtained\nModifications to our product candidates, after they have been approved for marketing, if at all, or to any other pharmaceutical product that we may develop in the future, may require new regulatory clearance, or approvals, and, if necessitated by a problem with a marketed product, may result in the recall or suspension of marketing of the previously approved and marketed product until clearances or approvals of the modified product are obtained. The FDA requires pharmaceutical products manufacturers to initially make and document a determination of whether or not a modification requires a new approval, supplement or clearance. A manufacturer may determine in conformity with applicable regulations and guidelines that a modification may be implemented without pre-clearance by the FDA; however, the FDA can review a manufacturers decision and may disagree. The FDA may also on its own initiative determine that a new clearance or approval is required. If the FDA requires new clearances or approvals of any pharmaceutical product or medical device for which we or our licensees receive marketing approval, if any, we or our licensees may be required to recall such product and to stop marketing the product as modified, which could require us or our licensees to redesign the product and will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In these circumstances, we may be subject to significant enforcement actions.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects\nEven if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product claims or that any regulatory authority whose approval we will require in order to market and sell our products in any territory will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that clinical trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our regulatory submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidates profile.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results\nWe have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals, including FDA approval. Clinical trials are expensive and complex, can take many years and have uncertain outcomes. We cannot predict whether we or our licensees will encounter problems with any of the completed, ongoing or planned clinical trials that will cause us, our licensees or regulatory authorities to delay or suspend clinical trials, or delay the analysis of data from completed or ongoing clinical trials. We estimate that clinical trials of our most advanced therapeutic candidates will continue for several years, but they may take significantly longer to complete. Failure can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future therapeutic candidates, including but not limited to:\n\u25cf delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for the clinical trials;\n\u25cf delays in obtaining institutional review board and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial;\n\u25cf slower than anticipated patient recruitment and enrollment;\n\u25cf negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials;\n\u25cf unforeseen safety issues;\n\u25cf uncertain dosing issues;\n\u25cf an inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; and\n\u25cf problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols.\nA number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, including those with greater resources and experience than us, have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after seeing promising results in earlier clinical trials. Despite the results reported in earlier clinical trials for our therapeutic candidates, we do not know whether any phase 3 or other clinical trials we or our licensees may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market our therapeutic candidates. If later-stage clinical trials of any therapeutic candidate do not produce favorable results, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for the therapeutic candidate may be adversely impacted, which will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement and access to drugs, which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability\nTo the extent our products are developed, commercialized, and successfully introduced to market, they may not be considered cost-effective and third-party or government reimbursement might not be available or sufficient. Globally, governmental and other third-party payors are becoming increasingly aggressive in attempting to contain health care costs by strictly controlling, directly or indirectly, pricing and reimbursement and, in some cases, limiting or denying coverage altogether on the basis of a variety of justifications, and we expect pressures on pricing and reimbursement from both governments and private payors inside and outside the U.S. to continue.\nIn the U.S., we are subject to substantial pricing, reimbursement, and access pressures from state Medicaid programs, private insurance programs and pharmacy benefit managers, and implementation of U.S. health care reform legislation is increasing these pricing pressures. The Affordable Care Act instituted comprehensive health care reform, and includes provisions that, among other things, reduce and/or limit Medicare reimbursement, require all individuals to have health insurance (with limited exceptions), and impose new and/or increased taxes. The future of the Affordable Care Act and its constituent parts are uncertain at this time.\nIn almost all markets, pricing and choice of prescription pharmaceuticals are subject to governmental control. Therefore, the price of our products and their reimbursement in Europe and in other countries is and will be determined by national regulatory authorities. Reimbursement decisions from one or more of the European markets may impact reimbursement decisions in other European markets. A variety of factors are considered in making reimbursement decisions, including whether there is sufficient evidence to show that treatment with the product is more effective than current treatments, that the product represents good value for money for the health service it provides, and that treatment with the product works at least as well as currently available treatments.\nThe continuing efforts of government and insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may affect our future revenues and profitability or those of our potential customers, suppliers, and collaborative partners, as well as the availability of capital.\nUnited States federal and state privacy laws, and equivalent laws of other nations, may increase our costs of operation and expose us to civil and criminal sanctions\nHIPPA, and the regulations that have been issued under it, and similar laws outside the United States, contains substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information. The HIPAA privacy rules prohibit covered entities, such as healthcare providers and health plans, from using or disclosing an individuals protected health information, unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under the privacy rules. Under the HIPAA security rules, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf. While we do not believe that we will be a covered entity under HIPAA, we believe many of our customers will be covered entities subject to HIPAA. Such customers may require us to enter into business associate agreements, which will obligate us to safeguard certain health information we obtain in the course of our relationship with them, restrict the manner in which we use and disclose such information and impose liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations.\nIn addition, under HITECH, which was signed into law as part of the U.S. stimulus package in February 2009, certain of HIPAAs privacy and security requirements are now also directly applicable to business associates of covered entities and subject them to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with these requirements. We may be deemed as a business associate of some of our customers. As a result, we may be subject as a business associate to civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements. Moreover, HITECH created a new requirement obligating business associates to report any breach of unsecured, individually identifiable health information to their covered entity customers and imposes penalties for failing to do so.\nIn addition to HIPAA, most U.S. states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the disclosure of confidential medical information, and many U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards, and data security breach notification requirements. These U.S. state laws, which may be even more stringent than the HIPAA requirements, are not supplanted by the federal requirements, and we are therefore required to comply with them to the extent they are applicable to our operations.\nThese and other possible changes to HIPAA or other U.S. federal or state laws or regulations, or comparable laws and regulations in countries where we conduct business, could affect our business and the costs of compliance could be significant. Failure by us to comply with any of the standards regarding patient privacy, identity theft prevention and detection, and data security may subject us to penalties, including civil monetary penalties and in some circumstances, criminal penalties. In addition, such failure may damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain customers and attract new customers.\nThe protection of personal data, particularly patient data, is subject to strict laws and regulations in many countries. The collection and use of personal health data in the E.U. is governed by the provisions of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (the Data Protection Directive). The Data Protection Directive imposes a number of requirements, including an obligation to seek the consent of individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information that must be provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities of individual E.U. member states and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The Data Protection Directive also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the E.U. to the U.S.. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive and the related national data protection laws of the E.U. member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties and harm our business. We may incur extensive costs in ensuring compliance with these laws and regulations, particularly if we are considered to be a data controller within the meaning of the Data Protection Directive.\nIf we fail to comply with the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state and foreign country laws, we could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and exclusion from federally funded healthcare programs including the Medicare and Medicaid programs and equivalent third country programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations\nA provision of the Social Security Act, commonly referred to as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward the referring, ordering, leasing, purchasing or arranging for, or recommending the ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare, Medicaid or any other federal healthcare program. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute protecting certain common business arrangements and activities from prosecution or regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that do not fit squarely within an exemption or safe harbor may be subject to scrutiny. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute is very broad in scope and many of its provisions have not been uniformly or definitively interpreted by existing case law or regulations. In addition, most of the states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and some of these laws are even broader than the federal Anti-Kickback Statute in that their prohibitions may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the source of payment. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may result in substantial criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nAll of our future financial relationships with U.S. healthcare providers, purchasers, formulary managers, and others who provide products or services to federal healthcare program beneficiaries will potentially be governed by the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. We believe our operations will be in compliance with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar state laws. However, we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to investigations or litigation alleging violations of these laws, which could be time-consuming and costly to us and could divert managements attention from operating our business, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if our arrangements were found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or similar state laws, the consequences of such violations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are other federal and state laws that may affect our ability to operate, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Moreover, we may be subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. Moreover, there are analogous state laws. Violations of these laws can result in substantial criminal, civil or administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.\nMoreover, the provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more aggressive and frequent investigations and enforcement by both the SEC and the Department of Justice. A determination that our operations or activities violated U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in imposition of substantial fines, interruption of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits, and other legal or equitable sanctions. In addition, lawsuits brought by private litigants may also follow as a consequence.\nIn both domestic and foreign markets, the development, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, handling, distribution, import, export, licensing, sale and storage of pharmaceuticals and medical devices are affected by a body of laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations, including those by Health Canada and the FDA, court decisions and similar constraints.\nSuch laws, regulations and other constraints can exist at the federal, provincial or local levels in Canada and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions. There can be no assurance that the Company and the Companys partners are in compliance with all of these laws, regulations and other constraints. The Company and its partners may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations in the future, and such laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on the business. The failure of the Company or its partners to comply with current or future regulatory requirements could lead to the imposition of significant penalties or claims and may have a material adverse effect on the business. In addition, the adoption of new laws, regulations or other constraints or changes in the interpretations of such requirements might result in significant compliance costs or lead the Company and its partners to discontinue product development and could have an adverse effect on the business.\nThe Companys international operations expose it and its representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent to operating in foreign jurisdictions that could materially adversely affect its operations and financial position.\nThese risks include:\n\u25cf country specific taxation policies;\n\u25cf imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u25cf export license requirements;\n\u25cf changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions; and\n\u25cf complexity of collecting receivables in a foreign jurisdiction.\nMoreover, applicable agreements relating to business in foreign jurisdictions are governed by foreign laws and are subject to dispute resolution in the courts of, or through arbitration proceedings in, the country or region in which the parties are located or another jurisdiction agreed upon by the parties. The Company cannot accurately predict whether such jurisdictions will provide an effective and efficient means of resolving disputes that may arise in the future. Even if it obtains a satisfactory decision through arbitration or a court proceeding, the Company could have difficulty in enforcing any award or judgment on a timely basis or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Securities\nIf we are not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of the TSX Exchange or Nasdaq, TSX Exchange or Nasdaq could delist our common shares\nIn order to maintain the listing of our common shares on the TSX Exchange and the Nasdaq Capital Market, we must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including those regarding director independence and independent committee requirements, minimum stockholders equity, minimum share price, and certain corporate governance requirements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with such applicable listing standards.\nFuture issuance of our common shares could dilute the interests of existing shareholders\nWe may issue additional common shares in the future. The issuance of a substantial number of common shares could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our shareholders. In addition, the sale of a substantial amount of common shares in the public market, in the initial issuance, in a situation in which we acquire a company and the acquired company receives common shares as consideration and the acquired company subsequently sells its common shares, or by investors who acquired such common shares in a private placement, could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common shares.\nShort sellers may be manipulative and may drive down the market price of our common shares\nShort selling is the practice of selling securities that the seller does not own, but rather has borrowed or intends to borrow from a third party with the intention of buying identical securities at a later date to return to the lender. A short seller hopes to profit from a decline in the value of the securities between the sale of the borrowed securities and the purchase of the replacement shares, as the short seller expects to pay less in that purchase than it received in the sale. It is therefore in the short sellers interest for the price of the stock to decline, and some short sellers publish, or arrange for the publication of, opinions or characterizations regarding the relevant issuer, often involving misrepresentations of the issuers business prospects and similar matters calculated to create negative market momentum, which may permit them to obtain profits for themselves as a result of selling the stock short.\nAs a public entity, we may be the subject of concerted efforts by short sellers to spread negative information in order to gain a market advantage. In addition, the publication of misinformation may also result in lawsuits, the uncertainty and expense of which could adversely impact our reputation, business, financial condition, and operating results. There are no assurances that we will not face short sellers efforts or similar tactics in the future, and the market price of our common shares may decline as a result of their actions.\nWe have a significant number of restricted share units, options and warrants outstanding, and while these options and warrants are outstanding, it may be more difficult to raise additional equity capital\nAs of October 25, 2023, we had outstanding restricted share units, options and warrants to purchase 10,314,012 common shares, respectively. The holders of these restricted share units, options and warrants are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common shares. We may find it more difficult to raise additional equity capital while these options and warrants are outstanding. At any time during which these warrants are likely to be exercised, we may be unable to obtain additional equity capital on more favorable terms from other sources. Additionally, the exercise of these options and warrants will cause the increase of our outstanding Common shares, which could have the effect of substantially diluting the interests of our current shareholders.\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market by our existing shareholders could cause our share price to fall\nSales of a substantial number of our common shares in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common shares. As of October 25, 2023, we have 10,314,012 shares issuable upon exercise of restricted share units, options and warrants. Sales of shares by these shareholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common shares. We intend to register the offering, issuance, and sale of all common shares that we may issue under our equity compensation plans. Once we register these shares, they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates and the lock-up agreements.\nWe are an Emerging Growth Company, which may reduce the amount of information available to investors\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Start-ups Act (the JOBS Act), and our status as a foreign private issuer will allow us to postpone the date by which we must comply with some of the laws and regulations intended to protect investors and to reduce the amount of information we provide in our reports filed with the SEC, which could undermine investor confidence in our company and adversely affect the market price of our Common shares.\nFor as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act, we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements that are applicable to public companies that are not emerging growth companies including:\n\u25cf the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requiring that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\u25cf any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditors report on the financial statements.\nWe intend to take advantage of these exemptions until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering in the United States, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least US$1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Common shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds US$700 million as of the prior June 30; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than US$1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our common shares or listed warrants (Warrants) less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common shares or Warrants less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares or Warrants, and our common share or Warrant price may be more volatile and may decline.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common shares will likely depend on whether the price of our Common shares increases, which may not occur\nWe have not paid cash dividends on any capital stock to date and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. Consequently, in the foreseeable future, you will likely only experience a gain from your investment in our common shares if the price of our common shares increases beyond the price in which you originally acquired the common shares.\nIn the event a market develops for our common shares or Warrants, the market price of our common shares or Warrants may be volatile\nIn the event a market develops for our common shares or Warrants, the market price of our common shares or Warrants may be highly volatile. Some of the factors that may materially affect the market price of our common shares or Warrants are beyond our control, such as changes in financial estimates by industry and securities analysts, conditions or trends in the industry in which we operate or sales of our common shares or Warrants. These factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares or Warrants, regardless of our performance. In addition, the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our Common shares.\nOur executive officers, directors and principal shareholders will maintain the ability to exert significant control over matters submitted to our shareholders for approval\nOur executive officers, directors and principal shareholders who owned more than 5% of our outstanding common shares will, in the aggregate, beneficially own shares representing approximately 21.16% of our share capital. As a result, if these shareholders were to act together, they would be able to control all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, as well as our management and affairs. For example, these persons, if they act together, would control the election of directors and approval of any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. This concentration of voting power could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company on terms that other shareholders may desire or result in management of our company that our public shareholders disagree with.\nIf we are or become classified as a passive foreign investment company, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences as a result\nGenerally, for any taxable year, if at least 75% of our gross income is passive income, or at least 50% of the value of our assets is attributable to assets that produce passive income or are held for the production of passive income, including cash, we would be characterized as a passive foreign investment company (PFIC) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of these tests, passive income includes dividends, interest gains from commodities and securities transactions, the excess of gains over losses from the disposition of assets which produce passive income (including amounts derived by reason of the temporary investment of funds raised in offerings of our shares) and rents and royalties other than rents and royalties which are received from unrelated parties in connection with the active conduct of a trade or business. If we are characterized as a PFIC, our U.S. shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences, including having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gains, the loss of the preferential rate applicable to dividends received on our common shares by individuals who are U.S. holders, and having interest charges apply to distributions by us and gains from the sales of our shares.\nOur status as a PFIC will depend on the nature and composition of our income and the nature, composition and value of our assets. Asset value is based on which the fair market value of each asset, including goodwill and going concern value (which may be determined by reference to the market value of our common shares, which may be volatile). Our status will also depend, in part, on when and how we utilize the cash proceeds from any securities offerings our business. Based upon the value of our assets, including any goodwill, and the nature and composition of our income and assets, we believe that we will be classified as a PFIC for the taxable year ending July 31, 2023, and possibly for succeeding years. However, even if we are classified as a PFIC for the year ending July 31, 2023, under an exception to the PFIC classification rules, we may be able to avoid such classification altogether if we can meet certain conditions set forth in the exception. (See the discussion of PFIC status under Taxation, U.S. Federal Income Taxation, below. Because the determination of whether we are a PFIC for any taxable year is a factual determination made annually after the end of each taxable year, there can be no assurance as to our status as a PFIC in any taxable year.\nThe tax consequences that would apply if we are classified as a PFIC would also be different from those described above if a U.S. shareholder were able to make a valid qualified electing fund (QEF) election. If we are classified as a PFIC, then we expect to provide U.S. shareholders with the information necessary for a U.S. shareholder to make a QEF election but there is no assurance that we will do so. See the discussion of PFIC status under Taxation, U.S. Federal Income Taxation, below.\nIf estimates of revenue, expenses, or capital or liquidity requirements change or are inaccurate, or if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy liquidity requirements, the Company may arrange additional financings\nBriaCell expects that its current cash and cash equivalent reserves will be sufficient to meet its anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the near future. In the future, the Company may also arrange financings to give it the financial flexibility to pursue attractive acquisition or investment opportunities that may arise. The Company may pursue additional financing through various means, including equity investments, issuances of debt, joint venture projects, licensing arrangements or through other means. The Company cannot be certain that it will be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The Companys ability to obtain additional financing may be impaired by such factors as the status of capital markets, both generally and specifically in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, and by the fact that it is a new enterprise without a proven operating history. If the amount of capital raised from additional financing activities, together with revenues from operations (if any), is not sufficient to satisfy the Companys capital needs, it may not be able to develop or advance its products, execute its business and growth plans, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated customer or partner requirements. If any of these events occur, the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Any future equity financings undertaken are likely to be dilutive to existing shareholders. Finally, the terms of securities issued in future capital transactions may include preferences that are more favourable to new investors.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they adversely change their recommendations or publish negative reports regarding our business or our shares, our share price and trading volume could decline\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our shares, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the market value of our securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause the price of our common shares and Warrants and our trading volume to decline.\nCertain Canadian legislation contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control\nCanadian legislation could discourage potential acquisition proposals, delay or prevent a change in control and limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay for our subordinate voting shares. For instance, a non-Canadian must file an application for review with the Minister responsible for the Investment Canada Act and obtain approval of the Minister prior to acquiring control of a Canadian business within the meaning of the Investment Canada Act, where prescribed financial thresholds are exceeded. Furthermore, limitations on the ability to acquire and hold our subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares may be imposed by the Competition Act (Canada). This legislation permits the Commissioner of Competition to review any acquisition or establishment, directly or indirectly, including through the acquisition of shares, of control over or of a significant interest in us. Otherwise, there are no limitations either under the laws of Canada or British Columbia, or in our articles on the rights of non-Canadians to hold or vote our subordinate voting shares and multiple voting shares. Any of these provisions may discourage a potential acquirer from proposing or completing a transaction that may have otherwise presented a premium to our shareholders.\nBecause we are a corporation incorporated in British Columbia and some of our directors and officers are resident in Canada or other countries, it may be difficult for investors in the United States to enforce civil liabilities against us based solely upon the federal securities laws of the United States. Similarly, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to enforce civil liabilities against our directors and officers residing outside of Canada\nWe are a corporation incorporated under the laws of British Columbia with our principal place of business in West Vancouver. Some of our directors and officers and the auditors or other experts named herein are residents of Canada and all or a substantial portion of our assets and those of such persons are located outside the United States. Consequently, it may be difficult for U.S. investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us or our directors or officers or such auditors who are not residents of the United States, or to realize in the United States upon judgments of courts of the United States predicated upon civil liabilities under the Securities Act. Investors should not assume that Canadian courts: (1) would enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained in actions against us or such persons predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws or the securities or blue sky laws of any state within the United States, or (2) would enforce, in original actions, liabilities against us or such persons predicated upon the U.S. federal securities laws or any such state securities or blue sky laws.\nSimilarly, some of our directors and officers are residents of countries other than Canada and all or a substantial portion of the assets of such persons are located outside Canada. As a result, it may be difficult for Canadian investors to initiate a lawsuit within Canada against these non-Canadian residents. In addition, it may not be possible for Canadian investors to collect from these non-Canadian residents judgments obtained in courts in Canada predicated on the civil liability provisions of securities legislation of certain of the provinces and territories of Canada. It may also be difficult for Canadian investors to succeed in a lawsuit in the United States, based solely on violations of Canadian securities laws. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2.

ITEM 6.\nNot applicable. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we review our estimates and assumptions. The estimates were based on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates or other forward-looking statements under different assumptions or conditions, but we do not believe such differences will materially affect our financial position or results of operations. Our actual results may differ materially as a result of many factors, including those set forth under the headings entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors.\nOverview\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (the Company), is a clinical-stage biotechnology company that is developing novel immunotherapies to transform cancer care. Immunotherapies have come to the forefront in the fight against cancer as they harness the bodys own immune system to recognize and destroy cancer cells. The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT\u2122 targeted immunotherapy in combination with an immune check point inhibitor in a pivotal1 Phase 3 study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. BriaCell recently reported benchmark-beating patient survival and clinical benefit in advanced metastatic breast with median overall survival of 13.5 months in BriaCells advanced metastatic breast cancer patients vs. 6.7-9.8 months for similar patients reported in the literature2. A completed Bria-IMT\u2122 Phase 1 combination study with retifanlimab (an anti-PD1 antibody manufactured by Incyte) confirmed tolerability and early-stage efficacy. BriaCell is also developing a personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy, Bria-OTS\u2122, which provides a platform technology to develop personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapies for numerous types of cancer, and a soluble CD80 protein therapeutic which acts both as a stimulator of the immune system as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n1. Critical Estimates and Judgements\nThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates. The financial statements include estimates which, by their nature, are uncertain. The impacts of such estimates are pervasive throughout the financial statements, and may require accounting adjustments based on future occurrences. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and also in future periods when the revision affects both current and future periods.\nThe critical judgments and significant estimates in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements are:\n\u25cf Intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. The carrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of impairment the impairment analysis is completed and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\n\u25cf The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate fair value of options and the warrant liability at each reporting date. The key assumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price of the Companys shares and the expected life of the warrants.\n\u25cf Preparation of the consolidated financial statement on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying value of its assets, including its intangible assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due\n\u25cf Provisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\n2. New Accounting Policies Adopted\nNo new accounting policies were adopted during the year ended July 31, 2023.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the year ended July 31, 2023, compared to the year ended July 31, 2022\nResearch Costs\nResearch costs are comprised primarily of (i) salaries and wages to Company employees at our laboratory; and (ii) clinical trials and investigational drug costs, which include the testing and manufacture of our investigational drugs and costs of our clinical trials.\nThe following is a breakdown of our research and development costs by project:\nYear ended July 31,\nClinical trials $ 7,843,760 $ 3,540,955\nPre-clinical projects 3,787,673 2,076,127\nChemical, Manufacturing and Control Costs (CMC Costs) 1,801,287 1,346,810\nOther 1,903,918 1,057,597\n$ 15,336,638 $ 8,021,489\nOur clinical trial expenses include our immunotherapy program, Bria-IMT\u2122, a 46-subject Phase I/IIa clinical trial. Clinical trial expenses increased in 2023 as we recruited more patients into the Bria-IMT\u2122 trial and began setting up the Bria-OTS\u2122 trial.\nPre-clinical projects include expenses incurred in our off-the-shelf personalized immunotherapies, including Bria-OTS+\u2122, and Bria-PROS\u2122. Our pre-clinical costs have increased in 2023 as we hired more staff to accelerate our existing pre-clinical program and added an additional pre-clinical program (sCD80).\nCMC costs include the manufacturing of Bria-IMT\u2122 and Bria-OTS\u2122 and all quality control and quality assurance testing on the investigational product. CMC costs increased in 2023 to support the additional patients in our trials.\nOther costs are ancillary expenses we incur such as costs to maintain our patents, investigation of early-stage projects, scientific advisory board expenses, contracts with vendors for pre-clinical work, and administration costs associated with all our research and development expenditure. Other costs increased in 2023 as we investigated additional potential pre-clinical projects.\nThe following is a breakdown of our research and development costs by nature of expenses:\nYear ended July 31,\nClinical trial sites and investigational drug costs $ 9,611,630 $ 4,912,530\nWages and salaries 3,878,367 2,225,050\nLaboratory Rent 194,880 138,354\nSupplies 579,169 309,992\nShare-based compensation 1,072,592 435,563\n$ 15,336,638 $ 8,021,489\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, research costs totaled $15,336,638, compared to $8,021,489 for the same period in 2022. The increase primarily resulted from the expansion of the Companys Bria-IMT\u2122 trial and higher clinical trials and investigational drug costs, which rose from $4,912,530 in 2022 to $9,611,630 in 2023. Laboratory costs also increased due to the hiring of additional employees and higher supplies, growing from $138,354 to $194,880 and $309,992 to $579,169, respectively. Additionally, non-cash share-based compensation expenses rose from $435,563 in 2022 to $1,072,592 in 2023, contributing to the overall increase in research and development expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, general and administrative expenses amounted to $7,935,626 as compared to $7,267,452 for the year ended July 31, 2022 The increase in general and administrative expenses primarily stems from higher insurance premiums, professional fees, and salaries, offset by a decrease in share-based compensation expenses.\nFinancial income (expenses), net\nFor the year ended July 31, 2023, financial income, net amounted to $2,969,870 as compared to financial loss $11,549,962 for the year ended July 31, 2022. Financial income (expenses) comprises, primarily, changes in the fair value of the warrant liability and interest earned on our treasury. For the year ended July 31, 2023, the value of the warrant liability decreased by $2,119,530. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease in the share price at period end. For the year ended July 31, 2022, there was an increase in the value of the liability of $11,658,372 due to the increased share price at the period end. Interest income for the year ended July 31, 2023 was $891,213 as compared to $136,731 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The increase in 2023 is attributable to higher interest rates in North America.\nLoss for the period\nThe Company reported a loss for the year ended July 31, 2023, of $20,302,394 as compared to $26,838,903 for the year ended July 31, 2022. The loss in 2023 primarily stems from a substantial increase in operational spending, offset by a gain in from a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability. Conversely, the higher loss in the prior period can be attributed to a larger increase in the fair value of the warrant liability. These factors account for the variance in the reported losses between the two periods, highlighting the impact of changes in warrant valuation and operational spending on the Companys financial performance.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Company has a working capital of 25,147,050 (July 31, 2022 - $41,405,613) and an accumulated deficit of $80,652,231 (July 31, 2022 - $60,349,837).\nAs of July 31, 2023, the Companys capital resources consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, comprised mostly of cash on deposit with banks, investments in money market funds, investments in U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment grade corporate debt securities. Our investment policy and strategy are focused on preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements.\nHistorically, the Company has financed its operation through private and public placement of equity securities, as well as debt financing. The Companys ability to fund its longer-term cash requirements is subject to multiple risks, many of which are beyond its control. The Company intends to raise additional capital, either through debt or equity financings in order to achieve its business plan objectives. Management believes that it can be successful in obtaining additional capital; however, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so. There is no assurance that any funds raised will be sufficient to enable the Company to attain profitable operations or continue as a going concern. To the extent that the Company is unsuccessful, the Company may need to curtail or cease its operations and implement a plan to extend payables or reduce overhead until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2023, the Companys overall position of cash and cash equivalents decreased by $19,790,560 from the year ended July 31, 2022 (including effects of foreign exchange). This decrease in cash can be attributed to the following:\nThe Companys net cash used in operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2023, was $23,744,860 as compared to $12,484,376 for the year ended July 31, 2022.\nCash gained in financing activities for the year ended July 31, 2023, was $3,954,300, as compared to a loss of $3,742,657 for the year ended July 31, 2022.\nOff-balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nTabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\nNone. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and are not required to provide the information required under this Item 7A. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe report of independent registered public accounting firm with PCAOB ID: 1930 and financial information required by this Item is attached hereto at the end of this report beginning on page and is hereby incorporated by reference. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal accounting and financial officer have concluded that as of July 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nAs of July 31, 2023, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. All control deficiencies that contributed to the material weakness as at Jul 31, 2022 were found to be effectively remediated. Management implemented the following remedial measures to address the material weakness which we tested and found to be operating effectively:\n\u25cf Periodic user access reviews of key applications\n\u25cf Adequate segregation of incompatible duties.\n\u25cf Approvals supporting transactions documented and evidence retained.\n\u25cf Monthly and quarterly checklists to keep track of the review performed for every key control and to ensure the control was performed consistently.\n\u25cf Adequate documentation to evidence key review procedures including appropriate documentation of the review.\n\u25cf Mitigating controls to compensate for the lack of SOC 1 reports of service organizations to cover the entire fiscal year.\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of July 31, 2023, our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended July 31, 2023. No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting, except for our remediation efforts described above.

There are no arrangements or understandings between or among our executive officers and directors pursuant to which any director or executive officer was or is to be selected as a director or executive officer.\nComposition of our Board\nUnder our amended articles of incorporation, our Board consists of a minimum of three directors and up to that number which was last set by ordinary resolution of the shareholders. Our Board is currently comprised of seven directors, and under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (BCBCA), as a reporting issuer, we must have no fewer than three directors. Under the BCBCA, a director may be removed with or without cause by a resolution passed by at least two-thirds of the votes cast by shareholders present in person or by proxy at a meeting and who are entitled to vote. The directors are appointed at the annual general meeting of shareholders and the term of office for each of the directors will expire at the time of our next annual shareholders meeting. Our amended articles of incorporation provide that, between annual general meetings of our shareholders, the directors may appoint one or more additional directors, but the number of additional directors may not at any time exceed one-third of the number of directors who held office at the expiration of the last meeting of our shareholders. Under the BCBCA, there is no minimum number of directors required to be resident Canadians as defined in the BCBCA.\nDirector Term Limits and Other Mechanisms of Board Renewal\nOur Board has not adopted director term limits or other automatic mechanisms of Board renewal.

For purposes of the Nasdaq Rules, an independent director means a person other than an executive officer or employee of the company who, in the opinion of the board of directors, has no relationship with the company that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director. Under NI 58-101, a director is considered to be independent if he or she is independent within the meaning of Section 1.4 of National Instrument 52-110-Audit Committees. Section 1.4 of NI 52-110 generally provides that a director is independent if he or she has no direct or indirect relationship with the issuer which could, in the view of the issuers board of directors, be reasonably expected to interfere with the exercise of the directors independent judgment.\nOur Board has undertaken a review of the independence of each director. Based on information provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, our Board has determined that Dr. Gross, Dr. Taub, Mr. Embro-Pantalony, Mr. Schmieg, and Mr. Bondarenko, representing five of the seven members of our Board, are independent as that term is defined under the Nasdaq Rules. In making this determination, our Board considered the current and prior relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our Board deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our shares by each non-employee director. Dr. Williams is not independent by virtue of being the Companys Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Lustig is not independent by virtue of being a significant securityholder of the Company.\nCertain members of our Board are also members of the boards of other public companies. Our Board has not adopted a director interlock policy, but is kept informed of other public directorships held by its members.\nMandate of the Board of Directors\nOur Board is responsible for supervising the management of our business and affairs, including providing guidance and strategic oversight to management.

In situations where a director has a material interest in a matter to be considered by our Board or any committee on which he or she serves, such director may be required to absent himself or herself from the meeting while discussions and voting with respect to the matter are taking place. Directors are also required to comply with the relevant provisions of the BCBCA regarding conflicts of interest.\nPosition Descriptions\nOur Board has adopted written terms of reference for the chairman which set out his or her key responsibilities, including duties relating to determining the frequency, dates and locations of meetings and setting Board meeting agendas, chairing Board and shareholder meetings and carrying out any other or special assignments or any functions as may be requested by our Board or management, as appropriate.\nOur Board has also adopted written terms of reference for each of the committee chairs which set out each of the committee chairs key responsibilities, including duties relating to determining the frequency, dates and locations of meetings and setting committee meeting agendas, chairing committee meetings, reporting to our Board and carrying out any other special assignments or any functions as may be requested by our Board.\nIn addition, our Board, in conjunction with our Chief Executive Officer, will develop and implement a written position description for the role of our Chief Executive Officer.\nOrientation and Continuing Education\nWe have implemented an orientation program for new directors under which a new director meets separately with the chairman of our Board, members of the senior executive team and the secretary.\nThe nominating and corporate governance committee will be responsible for coordinating orientation and continuing director development programs relating to the committees mandate.

The nominating and corporate governance committee will assist our Board with the monitoring of compliance with the code of conduct, and will be responsible for considering any waivers therefrom (other than waivers applicable to members of the nominating and corporate governance committee, which shall be considered by the audit committee, or waivers applicable to our directors or executive officers, which shall be subject to review by our Board as a whole).\nRequirement for Directors and Officers to Disclose Interest in a Contract or Transaction\nIn accordance with the BCBCA, each director and officer must disclose the nature and extent of any interest that he or she has in a material contract or material transaction whether made or proposed with us, if the director or officer is a party to the contract or transaction, is a director or an officer or an individual acting in a similar capacity of a party to the contract or transaction, or has a material interest in a party to the contract or transaction.

In order to ensure that violations or suspected violations can be reported without fear of retaliation, harassment or an adverse employment consequence, we will adopt a whistleblowing policy which will contain procedures that are aimed to facilitate confidential, anonymous submissions of complaints by our directors, officers, employees and others.\nCommittees of the Board\nWe currently have an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, with each committee having a written charter.\nAudit Committee\nOur Audit Committee is currently comprised of Vaughn C.

A company cannot indemnify an indemnifiable person if it is prohibited from doing so under its articles or by applicable law. A company may pay, as they are incurred in advance of the final disposition of an eligible proceeding, the expenses actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnifiable person in respect of that proceeding only if the indemnifiable person has provided an undertaking that, if it is ultimately determined that the payment of expenses was prohibited, the indemnifiable person will repay any amounts advanced. Subject to the aforementioned prohibitions on indemnification, a company must, after the final disposition of an eligible proceeding, pay the expenses actually and reasonably incurred by an indemnifiable person in respect of such eligible proceeding if such indemnifiable person has not been reimbursed for such expenses, and was wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the outcome of such eligible proceeding or was substantially successful on the merits in the outcome of such eligible proceeding. On application from an indemnifiable person, a court may make any order the court considers appropriate in respect of an eligible proceeding, including the indemnification of penalties imposed or expenses incurred in any such proceedings and the enforcement of an indemnification agreement. As permitted by the BCBCA, under Article 21.1, we are required to indemnify our directors and former directors (and such individuals respective heirs and legal representatives) and we will indemnify any such person to the extent permitted by the BCBCA.\nThe BCBCA provides certain protections under Part 5 - Management, Division 5 - Indemnification of Directors and Officers and Payment of Expenses, to our current and former directors and officers, as well as other eligible parties defined in Section 159 of the BCBCA (the Eligible Parties, each an Eligible Party). The Company will indemnify the Eligible Parties, to the fullest extent permitted by law and subject to certain limitations listed in Section 163 of the BCBCA, against any proceeding in which an Eligible Party or any of the heirs and personal or other legal representatives of the Eligible Party, by reason of the Eligible Party being or having been a director or officer of, or holding or having held a position equivalent to that of a director or officer of, the Company or an associated corporation (a) is or may be joined as a party, or (b) is or may be liable for or in respect of a judgment, penalty or fine in, or expenses related tom, the proceeding.\nWe maintain insurance policies relating to certain liabilities that our directors and officers may incur in such capacity.

(the Company) as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss, changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company as of July 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its consolidated operations and its consolidated cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended July 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (BriaCell or the Company) was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) on July 26, 2006 and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) under the symbol BCT and the Company also trades on the Nasdaq Capital Market (NASDAQ) under the symbols BCTX and BCTXW.\nb. BriaCell Therapeutics Corporation. (the Company), is an immuno-oncology biotechnology company. The Company is currently advancing its Bria-IMT targeted immunotherapy program against end-stage breast cancer to Phase 3 study which has been approved by the FDA and is expected to start before end of 2023. BriaCell is also developing a personalized off-the-shelf immunotherapy, Bria-OTS\u2122, and a soluble CD80 protein therapeutic which acts both as a stimulator of the immune system as well as an immune checkpoint inhibitor.\nc. The Company continues to devote substantially all of its efforts toward research and development activities. In the course of such activities, the Company has sustained operating losses and expects such losses to continue in the foreseeable future. The Companys accumulated deficit as of July 31, 2023 was $80,652,231(July 31, 2022 - $60,349,837) and negative cash flows from operating activities during the year ended July 31, 2023 was $23,744,860 (July 31, 2022 - $12,484,376). The Company is planning to finance its operations from its existing and future working capital resources and to continue to evaluate additional sources of capital and financing. The Company believes that its existing capital resources will be adequate to satisfy its expected liquidity requirements for at least twelve months from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements.\nd. The Company has two wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries: (i) BriaCell Therapeutics Corp. (BTC), which was incorporated in April 3, 2014, under the laws of the state of Delaware. (ii) BTC has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapientia Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sapientia), which was incorporated in September 20, 2012, under the laws of the state of Delaware. The Company also has one Canadian subsidiary: BriaPro Therapeutics Corp, (BriaPro) which was incorporated on May 15, 2023, was incorporated under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). As of July 31, 2023, BriaPro was a wholly-owned. See also note 15a. (Sapientia and BTC and BriaPro together, the Subsidiaries)\nThe Company has one operating segment and reporting unit.\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\na. Basis of presentation of the financial statements:\nThe Companys consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nb. Use of estimates, assumptions and judgements:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Companys management believes that the estimates, judgment and assumptions used are reasonable based upon information available at the time they are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nGoing Concern\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statement on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and payments of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern, it may be unable to realize the carrying value of its assets, including its intangible assets and to meet its liabilities as they become due.\nWarrants and options\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options at the grant date, and the warrant liability at the grant date and each reporting period date. The key assumptions used in the model are the expected future volatility in the price of the Companys shares and the expected life of the warrants.\nIncome Taxes\nProvisions for taxes are made using the best estimate of the amount expected to be paid based on a qualitative assessment of all relevant factors. The Company reviews the adequacy of these provisions at the end of the reporting period. However, it is possible that at some future date an additional liability could result from audits by taxing authorities. Where the final outcome of these tax-related matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will affect the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication of impairment. The carrying value of intangibles with definite lives is reviewed each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If there are indications of impairment the impairment analysis is completed and if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is impaired and impairment loss is recognized.\nc. Principal of consolidation:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nd. Consolidated financial statements in U.S dollars:\nThe functional currency is the currency that best reflects the economic environment in which the Company and its subsidiary operates and conducts their transactions. The Companys management believes that the functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar.\nAccordingly, monetary accounts maintained in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are remeasured into U.S. dollars at each reporting period end in accordance with ASC No. 830 Foreign Currency Matters. All transaction gains and losses of the remeasured monetary balance sheet items are reflected in the statements of operations as financing income or expenses as appropriate.\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\ne. Cash and cash equivalents:\nCash equivalents are short-term highly liquid deposits that are readily convertible to cash with original maturities of three months or less, at the date acquired, and investments with maturities of longer than three months where the investment can be liquidated before the maturity date without a significant penalty.\nf. Property and equipment, net:\nProperty and equipment with individual values of over $2,500 are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets at the following annual rates:\nSCHEDULE OF ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF ASSETS\n%\nComputers and peripheral equipment\n20-33\ng. Intangible assets, net:\nSeparately acquired intangible assets are measured on initial recognition at cost including directly attributable costs. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition date. Expenditures relating to internally generated intangible assets, excluding capitalized development costs, are recognized in profit or loss when incurred.\nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. Recoverability of these group of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the group of assets is expected to generate. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nThe amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset are reviewed at least at each year end.\nIntangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not systematically amortized and are tested for impairment annually, or whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The useful life of these assets is reviewed annually to determine whether their indefinite life assessment continues to be supportable. If the events and circumstances do not continue to support the assessment, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite life is accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate and on that date the asset is tested for impairment. Commencing from that date, the asset is amortized systematically over its useful life.\nThe details of intangible assets are as follows:\nSCHEDULE OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nPatents\nUseful life\nyears\nAmortization method\nStraight-line\nIn-house development or purchase\nPurchase\nFor the years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, no indicators of impairment have been identified.\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nh. Research and Development expenses:\nResearch and development expenses are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss when incurred. Research and development expenses consist of intellectual property, development and production expenditures.\ni. Fair value of financial instruments:\nThe accounting guidance for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value, clarifies the definition of fair value, and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. The accounting guidance establishes a three-tiered hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.\nLevel - Observable inputs that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets but corroborated by market data.\nLevel - Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data are available.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade payable and accrued expenses and other payables approximate their fair value due to the short-term maturity of such instruments.\nThe carrying amount of warrant liabilities is recorded at the fair value at each reporting period.\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nj. Leases:\nThe Company accounts for leases according to ASC 842, Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease and the classification of that lease at inception based on: (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has a right to direct the use of the asset. An ROU asset represents the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease agreement. An ROU asset is measured based on the discounted present value of the remaining lease payments, plus any initial direct costs incurred and prepaid lease payments, excluding lease incentives. The lease liability is measured at lease commencement date based on the discounted present value of the remaining lease payments. The implicit rate within the operating leases is generally not determinable, therefore the Company uses the Incremental Borrowing Rate (IBR) based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Companys IBR is estimated to approximate the interest rate for collateralized borrowing with similar terms and payments and in economic environments where the leased asset is located. An option to extend the lease is considered in connection with determining the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. An option to terminate is considered unless it is reasonably certain that the Company will not exercise the option.\nThe Company elected the practical expedient for lease agreements with a term of twelve months or less and does not recognize right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities in respect of those agreements. The Company also elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for its leases.\nk. Share-based compensation:\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which requires companies to estimate the fair value of equity-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model. The value of the award is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods, which is the vesting period of the respective award, on a straight-line basis when the only condition to vesting is continued service.\nThe Company has selected the Black-Scholes option-pricing model as the most appropriate fair value method for its option awards. The Company recognizes forfeitures of equity-based awards as they occur. Restricted share units use the share price on the grant date to determine the fair value of the restricted share unit award.\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 2: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont.)\nl. Income Taxes:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company provides a valuation allowance, to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value, if needed.\nASC 740 offers a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring a liability for uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that, on an evaluation of the technical merits, the tax position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. As of July 31, 2023, and 2022 no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was recorded as a result of ASC 740.\nm. Basic and diluted net loss per Share:\nThe Companys basic net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of ordinary shares outstanding for the period, without consideration of potentially dilutive securities. The diluted net loss per share is calculated by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the period using the treasury share method or the if-converted method based on the nature of such securities. Diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share in periods when the effects of potentially dilutive ordinary shares are anti-dilutive.\nn. Recently issued and adopted accounting standards:\nAs an emerging growth company, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) allows the Company to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. The Company has elected to use this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. The adoption dates discussed below reflects this election.\n1. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 (Topic 326), Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected credit loss model and requires a financial asset measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The guidance will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. Effective August 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-13. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.\n2. In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity (ASU 2020-06). The final guidance issued by the FASB for convertible instruments eliminates two of the three models in ASC 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features. Separate accounting is still required in certain cases. Additionally, among other changes, the guidance eliminates some of the conditions for equity classification in ASC 815-40-25 for contracts in an entitys own equity. The guidance also requires entities to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and include the effect of share settlement for instruments that may be settled in cash or shares, except for certain liability-classified share-based payment awards. ASU 2020-06 is effective for the company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Effective August 1, 2021, the Company early adopted ASU 2020-06. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the financial statements.\nBriaCell Therapeutics Corp\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nFor the Years Ended July 31, 2023 and 2022\n(Expressed in US Dollars, except share and per share data and unless otherwise indicated)\nNOTE 3: PREPAID EXPENSES\nPrepaid expenses as of July 31, 2023 includes an amount of $4,701,679 in respect of a Master Service and Technology Agreement (the MST Agreement) signed with Prevail InfoWorks, Inc. (InfoWorks) pursuant to which InfoWorks will provide clinical services and technologies for the Companys upcoming pivotal study in advanced metastatic breast cancer. The Company paid InfoWorks an upfront fee of $5,379,945 upon signing of the MST Agreement. These fees will be amortized over the period of the clinical trial.\nNOTE 4: INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

The Company has not completed an IRC 382/383 analysis regarding the limitation of NOL and credit carryforwards. If a change in ownership were to have occurred, the annual limitation may result in the expiration of NOL carryforwards and credits before utilization. If eliminated, the related asset would be removed from the deferred tax asset schedule with a corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance.\nThe Company has adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, which clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions. ASC 740-10 requires that the Company recognize the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. For the year ended July 31, 2023, the Company had no material unrecognized tax benefits, and based on the information currently available, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits are expected in the next 12 months.\nThe Companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. The Company has no accruals for interest or penalties on its accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of July 31, 2023, and 2022, and has not recognized interest or penalties in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended July 31, 2023, and 2022.\nNOTE 11: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making operating and financial decisions.
