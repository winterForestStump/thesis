    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nOn July 26, 2023, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. announced its new brand and assumed name, Radius Recycling, reflecting its position within and connection to the circular economy. The Company will seek approval from its shareholders to change its legal name to Radius Recycling, Inc. at its January 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nFounded in 1906, Radius Recycling is one of North Americas largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. As a vertically integrated organization, we offer a range of products and services to meet global demand through our network that includes 50 retail self-service auto parts stores, 54 metals recycling facilities, and an electric arc furnace (EAF) steel mill. Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes a single operating and reportable segment.\nWorldwide demand for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal is driven primarily by production levels for finished steel and for products using nonferrous metal. Recycled ferrous metal is the primary feedstock for steel mill production using EAF technology and one of the raw materials utilized for steel manufacturing using blast furnace technology. Steel mills around the world, including those in the North American domestic market in which our own steel mill operates, are the primary end markets for our recycled ferrous metal products. Specialty steelmakers, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors globally are the primary end markets for our recycled nonferrous metal products. Our steel mill produces finished steel products using internally sourced recycled ferrous metal as the primary raw material and sells to customers located primarily in the Western United States and Western Canada.\nWe believe long-term demand for recycled metals will continue to be driven by factors including global economic growth and an increased focus on environmental policies promoting natural resource conservation, decarbonization, and lower energy usage. We believe the significant environmental benefits and production efficiencies associated with steelmaking that maximizes the use of recycled metal as a raw material, compared to iron ore mined from natural resources, will positively contribute to worldwide long-term demand for recycled ferrous metal. Further, we believe decarbonization efforts by companies, industries, and governments around the world, including investments in low carbon technologies such as renewable energies, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency solutions that are more metal intensive and minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, support global long-term demand for recycled nonferrous metal such as aluminum and copper.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nRecycling Services\nOn November 18, 2022, we acquired the operating assets of ScrapSource, a recycling services company that provides solutions for industrial companies that generate scrap metal from their manufacturing process. The acquired business expands our national recycling services operations and utilizes primarily long-term contracts through which ScrapSource charges a fee to suppliers of scrap material in exchange for its services. The total purchase consideration was approximately $25 million.\nExpansion of Southeast Recycling Operations\nOn April 29, 2022, we acquired two recycling facilities in the greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, including a metal shredding operation and recycled auto-parts center, from the previous owners of Encore Recycling. The total purchase consideration was approximately $64 million. On October 1, 2021, we acquired eight metals recycling facilities across Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky from Columbus Recycling, a provider of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products and recycling services. The total purchase consideration was approximately $117 million. The acquired Encore Recycling and Columbus Recycling operations purchase and process scrap metal from industrial manufacturers, local recycling companies, and individuals, and sell the recycled products to regional foundries and steel mills. The acquired Encore Recycling operations also purchase and recycle end-of-life vehicles, including through use of its shredding, nonferrous processing, and separation systems. Combined with our other regional metals recycling facilities and recycled auto-parts centers, the acquired operations offer additional recycling products, services, and logistics solutions to customers and suppliers across the Southeastern United States and nearly doubled our metals recycling facility count in the region.\nSee Note 7 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n2 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nRevenue-Generating Activities\nWe acquire, process, and recycle end-of-life (salvaged) vehicles, rail cars, home appliances, industrial machinery, manufacturing scrap, and construction and demolition scrap through our facilities. Our retail self-service auto parts stores located across the United States (U.S.) and Western Canada, which operate under the commercial brand-name Pick-n-Pull, procure the significant majority of our salvaged vehicles and sell serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles. Upon acquiring a salvaged vehicle, we remove catalytic converters, aluminum wheels, and batteries for separate processing and sale prior to placing the vehicle in our retail lot. After retail customers have removed desired parts from a vehicle, we may remove remaining major component parts containing ferrous and nonferrous metals, which are primarily sold to wholesalers. The remaining auto bodies are crushed and shipped to our metals recycling facilities where geographically practical, or sold to third parties, for shredding. At our metals recycling facilities, we process mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing, torching, shearing, shredding, separating, and sorting, resulting in recycled ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed metal pieces of a size, density, and metal content required by customers to meet their production needs. Each of our shredding, nonferrous processing, and separation systems is designed to optimize the recovery of valuable recycled metal.\nWe operate seven deepwater port locations, six of which are equipped with large-scale shredders. Our largest port facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; and Tacoma, Washington each operate a mega-shredder with 7,000 to 9,000 horsepower. Our port facilities in Salinas, Puerto Rico, and Kapolei, Hawaii operate shredders with 1,500 and 4,000 horsepower, respectively. Our port facility in Providence, Rhode Island does not operate a shredder, but exports recycled ferrous metal acquired in the regional market. In addition, we operate a 2,500-horsepower shredder at our non-port facility in Lithonia, Georgia, which we acquired as part of the purchase of the Encore Recycling business in April 2022. Our shredders are designed to provide a denser product and, in conjunction with advanced separation equipment, a more refined form of recycled ferrous metal which can be used efficiently by steel mills in the production of new steel. The shredding process reduces auto bodies and other scrap metal into fist-size pieces of shredded recycled metal. The shredded material is then carried by conveyor under magnetized drums that attract the ferrous metal and separate it from the mixed nonferrous metal and other residue, resulting in a consistent and high-quality shredded ferrous product. The mixed nonferrous metal and residue then pass through a series of additional mechanical systems designed to recover and separate the nonferrous metal from the residue. The remaining mixed nonferrous metal is then further sorted by product and size grade before being sold as joint products, which include mainly zorba (primarily aluminum), zurik (primarily stainless steel), and shredded insulated wire (primarily copper and aluminum). We sell further separated products with higher metal content such as twitch (light gauge recycled aluminum) and shredded copper and brass. We also purchase nonferrous metal directly from industrial vendors and other suppliers and aggregate and prepare this metal for shipment to customers by ship, rail, or truck.\nWe invest in nonferrous metal extraction and separation technologies to optimize the recovery of valuable nonferrous metal and to meet the metal purity requirements of customers. We have a major strategic initiative currently in progress and partially completed to replace, upgrade, and add to our existing nonferrous metal recovery technologies in order to increase metal recovery and the volume of nonferrous material from shredding operations, provide additional product optionality, create higher quality furnace-ready products, and reduce the metallic portion of shredder residue disposed in landfills. Our program comprises seven primary nonferrous recovery systems at our major shredder facilities. Of these systems, three are major aluminum and four are major copper recovery systems. Our initiative also includes two aluminum separation systems, one on each coast, and four copper separation systems. The construction, commissioning, and ramp up of these new technologies, including commencement of permitting approvals, began substantially in fiscal 2021 and are anticipated to be completed during fiscal 2024, with total capital expenditures estimated to be approximately $133 million, of which approximately $130 million has been incurred, including $21 million during fiscal 2023.\nIn addition to the sale of recycled metal processed at our facilities, we provide a variety of recycling and related services including brokering the sale of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal generated by retail and industrial entities and demolition projects to customers in the domestic market, among other services. We also lease machinery assets to customers primarily to facilitate the provision of reverse logistics and other recycling services. Contract consideration for our recycling services is generally less sensitive to changes in market prices for scrap metal compared to sales of recycled metal from our recycling operations.\nOur steel mill melt shop includes an EAF, a ladle refining furnace with enhanced steel chemistry refining capabilities, and a five-strand continuous billet caster, permitting the mill to produce special alloy grades of steel not currently produced by other mills on the West Coast of the U.S. The substantial majority of billets produced are reheated in a natural gas-fueled furnace and are then hot-rolled through the rolling mill to produce finished steel long products. The rolling mill has an effective annual production capacity under current conditions of approximately 580 thousand tons of finished steel products.\n3 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nProducts and Services\nRecycled ferrous metal is a key feedstock used in the production of finished steel and is largely categorized into heavy melting steel (HMS), plate and structural (bonus), and shredded scrap metal (shred), although there are various grades of each category depending on metal content and the size and consistency of individual pieces. These attributes affect the products relative value.\nOur nonferrous products include mixed metal joint products recovered from the shredding process, as well as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, nickel, brass, titanium, lead, and high temperature alloys. We also sell catalytic converters to specialty processors that extract the nonferrous precious metals including platinum, palladium, and rhodium.\nWe provide recycling and related services involving scrap metal and other recyclable materials to a range of customers, including large retailers, industrial manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, and owners of end-of-life railcars. These services include primarily scrap brokerage, certified destruction, automotive parts recycling, railcar dismantling, and reverse logistics. During fiscal 2023, we expanded our recycling services operations through our acquisition of ScrapSource. Also in fiscal 2023, we launched our integrated recycling services activities under our trademarked 3PRTM brand which stands for third-party recycling and encompasses all our recycling services offerings.\nEach retail self-service auto parts store offers an extensive selection of vehicles (including domestic and foreign cars, vans, and light trucks) from which customers can remove and purchase parts. We employ proprietary information technology systems to centrally manage and operate the geographically diverse network of auto parts stores, and we regularly rotate the inventory to provide customers with greater access to parts. Our used auto parts inventory is also searchable on our Pick-n-Pull public website. We enter into limited duration contracts with public entities and other third parties for vehicle dismantling and asset recovery services, which provide a source of low-cost salvage vehicles.\nOur steel mill produces semi-finished goods (billets) and finished goods, consisting of rebar, coiled rebar, wire rod, merchant bar, and other specialty products, using recycled ferrous metal sourced internally from our recycling and joint venture operations and other raw materials. Semi-finished goods are predominantly used for the manufacturing of finished products. Rebar is produced in either straight length steel bars or coils and used to increase the strength of poured concrete. Coiled rebar is preferred by some manufacturers because it reduces the waste generated by cutting individual lengths to meet customer specifications and, therefore, improves yield. Wire rod is steel rod, delivered in coiled form, used by manufacturers to produce a variety of products such as chain link fencing, nails, wire, stucco netting, and pre-stressed concrete strand. Merchant bar consists of rounds and square steel bars used by manufacturers to produce a wide variety of products, including bolts, threaded bars, and dowel bars. Our steel mill is also an approved supplier of high-quality rebar to support nuclear power plant construction and has a license to produce certain patented high-strength specialty steels.\nActive Facilities\nTabular presentation of our active facilities by geographic region is as follows:\nAuto Parts\nStores\nMetals Recycling\nFacilities(1)\nTotal Recycling\nFacilities(2)\nLarge-Scale\nShredders(3)\nDeepwater\nPorts\nSteel\nFacilities(4)\nNorthwest\n(WA, OR, MT)\nSouthwest and Hawaii\n(CA, NV, UT, HI)\nMidwest and South\n(AR, IL, IN, OH, MO, KS, TX)\n-\n-\n-\n-\nNortheast\n(MA, ME, NH, RI)\n-\nSoutheast and Puerto Rico\n(GA, AL, TN, FL, VA, KY, MS, PR)\n-\nWestern Canada\n(BC, AB)\n-\n-\n-\nTotal\n(1)Excludes joint venture facilities.\n(2)Excludes one dedicated recycling services office in Texas.\n(3)All large-scale shredding operations employ nonferrous extraction and separation equipment.\n(4)Includes one steel mill in Oregon and one distribution center in California.\n4 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nPricing\nDomestic and foreign prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal are generally based on prevailing market rates, which differ by region, and are subject to market cycles that are influenced by worldwide demand from steel and other metal producers, the availability of materials that can be processed into saleable recycled metal, and regulatory policies, among other factors. Sanctions, trade actions, and licensing and inspection requirements can also impact pricing for the affected products. Recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal sales contracts generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed to which, in most cases, includes freight.\nWe respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating income. The spread between selling prices for processed metal and the cost of purchased scrap metal (metal spread) is subject to a number of factors, including differences in the market conditions between the domestic regions where scrap metal is acquired and the areas in the world to which the processed metals are sold, market volatility from the time the selling price is agreed upon with the customer until the time the scrap metal is purchased, changes in the availability of scrap metal including the volume generated by source and grade, and changes in transportation costs. We generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating income and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress.\nThe sales prices for auto parts from salvaged vehicles are deeply discounted from prevailing national new and refurbished sales prices offered at full-service auto dismantlers, retail auto parts stores, and car dealerships. Our stores provide a list price, available at each location and online. Prices for auto bodies sold to third parties and for major component parts, such as engines, transmissions, and alternators sold to wholesalers, are based on prevailing recycled metal market rates which differ by region and are subject to market cycles. Prices for catalytic converters sold to third-party processors are based on prevailing market rates for the extracted precious metals including platinum, palladium, and rhodium. By consolidating shipments of auto bodies and component parts, we are able to optimize prices by focusing on larger wholesale customers that pay a premium for volume and consistency of shipments.\nOur finished steel product prices differ by product size and grade. Selling prices are influenced by the price of raw materials, including the cost of recycled ferrous metal and required consumables including graphite electrodes and alloys, as well as regional demand in the West Coast and Western Canadian markets. Selling prices for our finished steel products may also be affected by the price and availability of steel imports.\nCustomers and Markets\nApproximately 95% of our consolidated revenues are derived from sales of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products and finished steel products. We sell our recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal products globally to steel mills, foundries, refineries, smelters, wholesalers, and other recycled metal processors. Our finished steel customers are primarily steel service centers, construction industry subcontractors, steel fabricators, wire drawers, and major farm and wood products suppliers. We had no external customers that accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nRecycled Ferrous Metal\nThe table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the amount of recycled ferrous metal sold to foreign and domestic customers, during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:\nFor the Year Ended August 31,\n% Increase (Decrease)\n($ in thousands)\n2023 vs. 2022\n2022 vs. 2021\nFerrous revenues\nDomestic\n$\n408,441\n$\n438,026\n$\n289,742\n(7\n)%\n%\nForeign\n1,031,542\n1,476,229\n1,268,149\n(30\n)%\n%\nTotal ferrous revenues\n$\n1,439,983\n$\n1,914,255\n$\n1,557,891\n(25\n)%\n%\nFerrous volumes (LT, in thousands)(1)\nDomestic(2)\n1,952\n1,806\n1,500\n%\n%\nForeign\n2,424\n2,810\n2,908\n(14\n)%\n(3\n)%\nTotal ferrous volumes (LT, in thousands)(3)\n4,376\n4,616\n4,408\n(5\n)%\n%\nLT = Long Ton, which is equivalent to 2,240 pounds.\n(1)Ferrous volumes sold externally and delivered to our steel mill for finished steel production.\n(2)Domestic includes volumes delivered to our steel mill for finished steel production.\n(3)May not foot due to rounding.\n5 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nWe export recycled ferrous metal primarily to countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region, and North, Central, and South America. Ferrous exports made up 55%, 61%, and 66% of our total ferrous volumes in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2023, the three countries from which we derived our largest ferrous export revenues from external customers were Bangladesh, Turkey, and India, which collectively accounted for 72% of our total ferrous export revenues. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, the three countries from which we derived our largest ferrous export revenues from external customers accounted for 71% and 63%, respectively, of our total ferrous export revenues. We generally attribute revenues from external customers to individual countries based on the country in which the customer is located. Our three largest external recycled ferrous metal customers accounted for 23% of total ferrous revenues in fiscal 2023, compared to 22% and 25% in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nRecycled Nonferrous Metal\nThe table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the amount of recycled nonferrous metal sold to foreign and domestic customers during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:\nFor the Year Ended August 31,\n% Increase (Decrease)\n($ in thousands)\n2023 vs. 2022\n2022 vs. 2021\nNonferrous revenues\nDomestic\n$\n378,972\n$\n480,919\n$\n367,744\n(21\n)%\n%\nForeign\n402,130\n411,525\n317,118\n(2\n)%\n%\nTotal nonferrous revenues\n$\n781,102\n$\n892,444\n$\n684,862\n(12\n)%\n%\nNonferrous volumes (pounds, in thousands)(1)\nDomestic\n316,490\n298,279\n219,126\n%\n%\nForeign\n422,447\n389,140\n374,252\n%\n%\nTotal nonferrous volumes (pounds, in thousands)(2)\n738,937\n687,419\n593,378\n%\n%\n(1)All nonferrous volumes sold externally.\n(2)May not foot due to rounding.\nNonferrous exports made up 57%, 57%, and 63% of our total nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The substantial majority of our nonferrous joint products recovered from the shredding process are sold to the export market currently and made up 44%, 45%, and 44% of our total nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. In fiscal 2023, the three countries from which we derived our largest nonferrous export revenues from external customers were Malaysia, China, and India, which collectively accounted for 72% of our total nonferrous export revenues. In fiscal 2022 and 2021, the three countries from which we derived our largest nonferrous export revenues from external customers accounted for 68% and 69%, respectively, of our total nonferrous export revenues.\nFinished Steel Products\nThe table below sets forth, on a revenue and volume basis, the amount of finished steel products sold during the last three fiscal years ended August 31:\nFor the Year Ended August 31,\n% Increase (Decrease)\n($ in thousands)\n2023 vs. 2022\n2022 vs. 2021\nSteel revenues(1)\n$\n507,550\n$\n531,731\n$\n379,203\n(5\n)%\n%\nFinished steel sales volumes (ST, in thousands)\n%\n(5\n)%\nST = Short Ton, which is equivalent to 2,000 pounds.\n(1)Steel revenues include predominantly sales of finished steel products, in addition to sales of semi-finished goods (billets) and steel manufacturing scrap.\nWe sell finished steel products to customers located primarily in the Western United States and Western Canada. Customers in California accounted for 53%, 55%, and 52% of our steel revenues in fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n6 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nDistribution\nWe deliver recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal to foreign customers by ship and to domestic customers by barge, rail, and road transportation networks. Cost efficiencies are achieved by operating deepwater terminal facilities in Everett, Massachusetts; Portland, Oregon; Oakland, California; Tacoma, Washington; and Providence, Rhode Island, all of which are owned, except for the Providence, Rhode Island facility which is operated under a long-term lease. We also have access to deepwater terminal facilities at Kapolei, Hawaii and Salinas, Puerto Rico through public docks. The use of deepwater terminals enables us to load ferrous material in large vessels capable of holding up to 50,000 tons for trans-oceanic shipments. We believe the use of our owned and leased terminal facilities is advantageous because it allows us to more effectively manage loading costs and minimize the berthing delays often experienced by users of unaffiliated terminals. From time to time, we may enter into contracts of affreightment, which guarantee the availability of ocean-going vessels, in order to manage the risks associated with ship availability and freight costs.\nOur nonferrous products are shipped in 20- to 30-ton capacity containers from ports and rail ramps located in close proximity to our recycling facilities. Containerized shipments are exported by marine vessels to customers globally, and domestic shipments are typically shipped to customers by rail or by truck.\nWe sell used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Both before and after retail customers have removed desired parts from acquired salvaged vehicles, we extract and consolidate certain valuable ferrous and nonferrous components from auto bodies for shipment by truck primarily to wholesale customers. We also remove and collect catalytic converters from salvaged vehicles for shipment by truck to specialty processers which extract the nonferrous precious metals. The salvaged auto bodies are crushed and shipped by truck to our metals recycling facilities where geographically practical, or to third-party recyclers, for shredding.\nWe sell finished steel products directly from our steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon and our distribution center in City of Industry, California (Los Angeles area). Finished steel products are shipped from the mill to the distribution center primarily by rail. The distribution center facilitates sales by maintaining an inventory of products close to major customers for just-in-time delivery. We communicate regularly with major customers to determine their anticipated needs and plan our rolling mill production schedule accordingly. Finished steel shipments to customers are made by common carrier, primarily truck or rail.\nSources of Unprocessed Metal\nThe most common forms of purchased unprocessed metal are obsolete machinery and equipment, such as automobiles, railroad cars, railroad tracks, home appliances and other consumer goods, scrap metal from manufacturing operations and retailers, and demolition metal from buildings and other infrastructure. Unprocessed metal is acquired from a diverse base of suppliers who unload at our facilities, from drop boxes at suppliers industrial sites, and through negotiated purchases from other large suppliers, including railroads, manufacturers, automobile salvage facilities, metal dealers, various government entities, and individuals. We typically seek to locate our retail auto parts stores in major population centers with convenient road access. Our auto parts store network spans 16 states in the U.S. and two provinces in Western Canada, with a majority of the stores concentrated in regions where our large-scale shredders are located. Through our network of auto parts stores, we seek to obtain salvaged vehicles from four primary sources: private parties, tow companies, auto auctions, and municipal and other contracts. We have a program to purchase vehicles from private parties called Cash for Junk Cars which is advertised in local markets. Private parties either call a toll-free number and receive a quote for their vehicle or obtain an instant online quote. The private party can either deliver the vehicle to one of our retail locations or arrange for the vehicle to be picked up. We also employ car buyers who travel to vendors and bid on vehicles. Further, we enter into limited duration contracts with public entities and other third parties for vehicle dismantling and asset recovery services, which provide a source of low-cost salvage vehicles. The expiration of such contracts may lead us to seek alternative sources of vehicles, potentially at a higher cost. We also source scrap metal and other recyclable materials through our recycling services from a range of customers including large retailers, industrial manufacturers, original equipment manufacturers, and railcar owners.\nThe majority of our metal collection and processing facilities receive unprocessed metal via major railroad routes, waterways, or highways. Metals recycling facilities situated near industrial manufacturing and major transportation routes have the competitive advantage of reduced freight costs because of the significant cost of freight relative to the cost of metal. The locations of our West Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the Northern California region, northward to Western Canada and Alaska, and to the East, including Idaho, Montana, Utah, Colorado, and Nevada. The locations of our East Coast facilities provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in New York, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont, Eastern Canada, and, from time to time, the Midwest. The locations of our facilities in Hawaii and Puerto Rico provide access to sources of unprocessed metal in the respective local markets. In the Southeastern U.S., approximately half of our ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metal volume is purchased from industrial companies, including auto manufacturers, with the remaining volume being purchased from smaller dealers and individuals. These industrial companies provide us with metals that are by-products of their manufacturing processes.\n7 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nThe supply of scrap metal from these various sources can fluctuate with the level of economic activity in the U.S. and can be sensitive to variability in recycled metal prices, particularly in the short term, as well as in costs such as labor and energy incurred by suppliers to generate scrap metal at economically viable levels. The effects of competition for supply of scrap metal, including of specific grades, can significantly impact the flow of scrap volumes into our facilities, our metal spreads, and our operating margins. The supply of scrap metal can also fluctuate, to a lesser degree, due to seasonal factors, such as severe weather conditions, which can inhibit scrap metal collections at our facilities and production levels in our facilities. Severe weather conditions can also adversely impact the timing of shipments of our products, the level of manufacturing activity utilizing our products, and retail admissions at our auto parts stores.\nWe operate an EAF steel mill in the Western U.S. that sources substantially all its recycled metal requirements from integrated metals recycling and joint venture operations. These operations provide our steel mill a mix of recycled metal grades, which allow the mill to achieve optimum efficiency in its melting operations.\nEnergy Supply\nWe require electricity to run our steel manufacturing operations, primarily its EAF. We purchase electricity under a long-term contract with McMinnville Water & Light (MW&L), which in turn relies on the Bonneville Power Administration. We entered into our current contract with MW&L in October 2011 that expires in September 2028. Our steel manufacturing operation also needs natural gas to operate its reheat furnace, which is used to reheat billets prior to moving them through the rolling mill. We address this demand through a natural gas agreement that obligates us at each month-end to purchase a volume of gas based on our projected needs for the immediately subsequent month on a take-or-pay basis priced using published natural gas indices. We periodically enter third-party contracts that mitigate the effect of changes in index prices on our natural gas cost for a portion of our consumption. The combined electricity and natural gas costs for our steel mill represented approximately 1% of our consolidated cost of goods sold in each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021.\nCompetition\nWe compete in the U.S. and in Western Canada for the purchase of scrap metal with large, well-financed recyclers of scrap metal, steel mills that own metal recycling facilities, and with smaller metals facilities and dealers. We also compete with brokers that buy scrap or recycled metal on behalf of domestic and foreign steel mills. Our auto stores compete for the purchase of end-of-life vehicles with other auto dismantlers, used car dealers, auto auctions, and metals recyclers. In general, the competitive factors impacting the purchase of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles are the price offered by the purchaser, the proximity of the purchaser to the source of scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles, and the purchasers ability to efficiently collect the scrap metal and end-of-life vehicles from certain suppliers locations.\nDemand for our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, structural and cyclical changes in markets, and other factors. For example, in fiscal 2023, an environment of slower economic growth and activity contributed to weaker market conditions for recycled metals globally, leading to significantly lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products year-over-year. We compete globally for the sale of processed recycled metal to finished steel and other metal product producers. The predominant competitive factors that impact recycled metal sales are price (including duties and shipping cost), reliability of service, product quality, the relative value of the U.S. dollar, and the availability and price of raw material alternatives, including recycled metal substitutes, such as pig iron, direct reduced iron, and hot briquetted iron (all three derived from iron ore), and semi-finished products, such as steel billets. Our ability to compete in certain export markets may be impacted by sanctions and trade actions, such as tariffs, quotas, and other import restrictions, and by licensing and inspection requirements. Further, our ability to sell into certain countries may be subject to product quality requirements. Such restrictions may require us to perform additional processing and packaging of certain recycled nonferrous metal products, as well as engage in increased inspection and certification activities, in order to continue selling into the affected markets.\nWe also compete for the sale of used auto parts to retail customers with other self-service and full-service auto dismantlers. The auto parts industry is characterized by diverse and fragmented competition and comprises a large number of aftermarket and used auto parts suppliers of all sizes, ranging from large, multinational corporations which serve both original equipment manufacturers and the aftermarket on a worldwide basis to small, local entities which have more limited supply. The main competitive factors impacting the retail sale of auto parts are price, availability and visibility of product, quality, and convenience of the retail stores to customers.\nOur ability to process substantial volumes of recycled metal products, our use of advanced processing and separation equipment, the number and geographic dispersion of our locations, our access to a variety of different modes of transportation, and the operating synergies of our integrated platform provide our business with the ability to compete successfully in varying market conditions.\nOur primary domestic competitors for the sale of finished steel products include Nucor Corporations manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Utah, and Washington, and Commercial Metals Companys manufacturing facilities in Arizona. In addition to domestic\n8 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\ncompetition, we compete with foreign steel producers, principally located in Asia, Canada, Mexico, and Central and South America, primarily in shorter length rebar and certain wire rod grades. The principal competitive factors in the steel market currently are price, quality, service, product availability, and the relative value of the U.S. dollar.\nFor more than a decade, our steel manufacturing operation, as part of a U.S. industry coalition, petitioned the U.S. Government under our international trade laws for relief in the form of antidumping and countervailing duties against wire rod and rebar products from a number of foreign countries. Many of those cases were successful, and the resulting antidumping and countervailing duty orders led to a decrease in finished steel imports into our domestic markets from the peak reached in fiscal 2016. Those antidumping and countervailing duty orders remained in effect during fiscal 2022. The duties imposed as part of these orders are periodically reassessed through the administrative review process. In addition, the U.S. Government conducts sunset reviews every five years to determine whether revocation of the orders would likely lead to resumption of dumping and subsidization and negatively impact the U.S. domestic industry. Affirmative decisions allow the orders to continue for an additional five years. During fiscal 2023, sunset reviews of the antidumping duty orders covering rebar from Japan and Taiwan, the countervailing duty order covering rebar from Turkey, the antidumping duty orders covering wire rod from Belarus, Italy, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom, and the countervailing duty orders covering wire rod from Italy and Turkey were completed. All reviews resulted in affirmative determinations such that the orders will remain in effect for an additional five years. During fiscal 2024, an additional sunset review covering rebar is likely to be initiated. If the final determination in any of these reviews is to revoke one or more of the orders, imports from those countries could increase which would negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nThere are also a number of antidumping and countervailing duty orders in effect in Canada covering rebar from many countries that we expect will continue to lead to a reduction in the volume of imports into Canada from these countries.\nThe long-term effectiveness of existing antidumping and countervailing duty orders related to imports of wire rod and rebar products is largely uncertain and is impacted by the level and pricing of imports and the U.S. Governments assessment of antidumping and countervailing duty margins as well as its assessment of continued injury to the U.S. industry as part of the sunset review process.\nIn March 2018, the United States imposed tariffs in the amount of 25 percent and 10 percent on imports of certain steel and aluminum products, respectively. The imposition of the tariffs was the conclusion of an investigation started in April 2017 under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 that allows for an exemption from normal international trade rules if imports of a product are harming national security. Currently, imports from certain countries are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. The Department of Commerce also implemented an exclusion process whereby U.S. entities can request that certain products be excluded from the Section 232 tariffs. We review any exclusion requests relevant to our product line to determine whether an objection might be appropriate. To date, the Biden Administration has allowed most Section 232 duties and procedures to remain in place.\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nWe are a company operating in a critical infrastructure industry, as defined by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders, we operated across our footprint throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the onset of COVID-19 and its negative effects on our business, most prominently reflected in our fiscal 2020 results, global economic conditions improved beginning in fiscal 2021 and continued to improve through most of fiscal 2022. However, there are ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic, including labor shortages, logistical challenges, and increases in costs for certain goods and services including due to the impact of inflation, which have negatively impacted our sales volumes, operating costs, and financial results to varying degrees.\nRegulatory Matters\nImpact of Legislation and Regulation\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our operations. Our businesses are subject to extensive and rapidly evolving local, state, and federal environmental protection, health, safety, and transportation laws and regulations relating to, among others:\nRemediation under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA);\nThe discharge of materials and emissions into the air;\nThe prevention and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination;\nThe management, treatment, and discharge of wastewater and storm water;\n9 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nThe generation, discharge, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials;\nThe protection of our employees health and safety; and\nClimate change generally.\nEnvironmental legislation and regulations have changed rapidly in recent years, and it is likely that we will be subject to more stringent environmental standards in the future. Legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress on multiple occasions to address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and global climate change. In August 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), a bill that, among other things, creates financial incentives intended to combat climate change, including by directly or indirectly discouraging use of oil and natural gas in favor of alternative sources of energy, among other measures. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how the climate-related measures in the IRA may affect our operations. A number of states, including states in which we have operations and facilities, have considered, are considering, or have already enacted legislation or executive action to develop information on or address climate change and GHG emissions, including state-level cap and trade programs and climate risk and carbon emissions disclosure requirements. For example, new laws in California (i) will require companies doing business in the state with more than $1 billion in total annual revenues to annually disclose Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions data starting in 2026 (for the prior financial year, starting on or after January 1, 2025) and Scope 3 emissions starting in 2027 (covering financial years starting on or after January 1, 2026); and/or (ii) will require companies doing business in the state with annual revenues over $500 million to biannually disclose their climate-related financial risks and the measures they have adopted to reduce and adapt to these risks. These actions may potentially inform and/or surpass the climate-related disclosure requirements proposed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nCurrently, we are required to annually report GHG emissions from our steel mill to the State of Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) and the EPA, and our operations in Oregon are subject to or may be impacted by ODEQ regulations, standards, and programs aimed at limiting GHG emissions and toxic air emissions in the state including from large stationary sources such as our steel mill and Portland metals recycling facility. The implementation of such regulations, standards, and programs and any associated costs, including any operating or capital expenditures, are uncertain, but may be material to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. In addition, we have and continue to incur material capital expenditures to enclose and install additional emission controls for our shredders to meet air emission standards or other regulatory requirements. See Compliance with existing and future climate change, greenhouse gas, and other air emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results in Part I, ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nDescribed below are risks, which are categorized as Risk Factors Relating to Our Business, Risk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment, and Risk Factors Relating to Our Employees, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows or could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report. See Forward-Looking Statements that precedes Part I of this report. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently deem immaterial may in the future have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nPotential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity\nIn December 2000, we were notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) that we are one of the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that owns or operates or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. In January 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that identified the selected remedy for Portland Harbor. The EPA has estimated the total cost of the selected remedy at $1.7 billion with a net present value cost of $1.05 billion (at a 7% discount rate) and an estimated construction period of 13 years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within +50% to -30% of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. Accordingly, the final cost may differ materially from that set forth in the ROD. The ROD provided only site-wide cost estimates and did not provide sufficient detail to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas within Portland Harbor. In addition, the ROD did not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs among the PRPs. Except for certain early action projects in which we are not involved, remediation activities at Portland Harbor are not expected to commence for a number of years. Moreover, those activities are expected to be sequenced, and the order and timing of such sequencing has not been determined. We have joined with approximately 100 other PRPs in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at Portland Harbor. We expect the next major stage of the allocation process to proceed in parallel with the remedial design process. In addition to the remedial action process overseen by the EPA, the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Trustee Council (Trustee Council) is assessing natural resource damages at Portland Harbor. We are working with the Trustee Council to finalize an early settlement of our alleged natural resource damage liability at Portland Harbor. Our environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 included $5 million and $6 million, respectively, relating to the Portland Harbor matters described above. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the allocation among the PRPs of costs of the investigations or remedial action costs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Among the facts being evaluated are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within Portland Harbor, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs. We have insurance policies that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remedial design, remedial action, and mitigation for or settlement of natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor. Most of these policies jointly insure us and MMGL, LLC (MMGL), an unaffiliated company, as the successor to a former subsidiary. We and MMGL have negotiated the settlement with certain insurers of claims against us related to Portland Harbor, continue to seek settlements with other insurers, and formed two Qualified Settlement Funds (QSFs) which became operative in fiscal 2020 and the second quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively, to hold such settlement amounts until funds are needed to pay or\n14 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nreimburse costs incurred by us and MMGL in connection with Portland Harbor. These insurance policies and the funds in the QSFs may not cover all of the costs which we may incur.\nThe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is separately providing oversight of our investigations and source control activities at various sites adjacent to Portland Harbor that are focused on controlling any current uplands releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. We have accrued liabilities for source control and related work at two sites, reflecting estimated costs of primarily investigation and design, which costs have not been material in the aggregate to date. No liabilities have been established in connection with investigations for any other sites because the extent of contamination, required source control work, and our responsibility for the contamination and source control work, in each case if any, have not yet been determined. In addition, pursuant to our insurance policies, we are being reimbursed for the costs we incur for required source control evaluation and remediation work.\nSignificant cash outflows in the future related to Portland Harbor could reduce the amount of our borrowing capacity that could otherwise be used for investment in capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. Any material liabilities or cash expenditures, net of recoveries, incurred in the future related to Portland Harbor could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements. See Contingencies - Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on these matters.\nGoodwill impairment charges may adversely affect our operating results\nGoodwill represents the excess purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $229 million and $255 million, respectively, of goodwill on our balance sheet. We test the goodwill balances allocated to our reporting units for impairment on an annual basis and when events occur or circumstances change that indicate that the fair value of one or more of our reporting units with allocated goodwill may be below its carrying amount. When testing goodwill for impairment, we may be required to measure the fair value of the reporting units as of a particular measurement date in order to determine the amount of impairment, if any. Market prices of our reporting units are not readily available; therefore, we typically estimate the fair value of reporting units with allocated goodwill using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for each applicable reporting unit. The determination of fair value under this income approach involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including regarding revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general, and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, to corroborate a reporting units income approach valuation, as well as to estimate the fair value of our other reporting units, including those with no allocated goodwill, we use a market approach based on earnings multiple data, and we perform a reconciliation of our estimate of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to our market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to inherent uncertainties and changes in the estimates and assumptions described above. Furthermore, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units as of a particular measurement date, most recently as of our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment test date of July 1, 2023, based on information available to management as of the measurement date. Therefore, the impact of, for example, changes in market conditions after the measurement date may not be fully captured in managements estimates and assumptions reflected in the fair values as of the measurement date.\nAs of our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment test date of July 1, 2023, we performed the quantitative goodwill impairment test for three of our reporting units with allocated goodwill, and we recorded an impairment charge of $39 million, representing a portion of the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to one reporting unit. A lack of recovery or further deterioration in market conditions for recycled metals from current levels, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting units with allocated goodwill, including the pace and extent of operating margin and volume recovery, a lack of recovery or further decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period, or an increase in the market-based WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nEquipment upgrades, equipment failures, and facility damage may lead to production curtailments or shutdowns\nOur business operations and recycling and manufacturing processes depend on critical pieces of equipment, including information technology equipment, shredders, nonferrous sorting technology, furnaces, and a rolling mill, which may be out of service occasionally for scheduled upgrades or maintenance or as a result of unanticipated failures or events. Our facilities are subject to equipment failures and the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as mechanical failures, fires, earthquakes, accidents, or violent weather conditions. For instance, although the impact on our operations as a result of natural disasters has not been significant to date, certain of\n15 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nour facilities in Puerto Rico have experienced damage due to hurricanes, including as a result of Hurricane Fiona in September 2022, and certain facilities in California, Oregon, and Washington were briefly closed in September 2020 due to poor air quality as a result of wildfires. Additionally, we experienced a fire at our Cascade Steel Rolling Mills in McMinnville, Oregon in May 2021 as well as at our metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts in December 2021. Direct physical loss or damage to property from these incidents was limited to the mills melt shop in the case of the steel mill and to the shredder building and equipment in the case of the Everett recycling facility, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. With respect to the Everett facility shredder fire, on January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement and repairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. In addition, shredding operations temporarily ceased at the facility on June 18, 2022, and, following discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office, we installed a temporary emission capture system and controls that allowed for the resumption of shredding operations on November 11, 2022, and for continued operation during the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continued during this period. The repair and replacement of most property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, was substantially completed by the end of our fiscal 2023. While we carry insurance that we anticipate will cover repair and replacement of property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from these fires, as discussed in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, our insurance coverage is subject to deductibles, and various conditions, exclusions, and limits. Moreover, our insurance coverage may be unavailable or insufficient to protect us against losses in the case of future events. In addition, insurance may not continue to be available in the future on acceptable terms or at acceptable costs. Interruptions in our processing and production capabilities and shutdowns resulting from unanticipated events also could disrupt customer and supplier relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nFailure to realize or delays in realizing expected benefits from capital projects, including investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements and information technology systems, may impact our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows\nWe may engage in capital projects based on the forecasted project economics, political and regulatory environments, and the expected return on the capital to be employed in the project. Large-scale projects may take many years to complete, during which time the political and regulatory environment or other market conditions may change from our forecast. For example, we make significant investments in processing and manufacturing technology improvements and other information technology systems aimed at increasing the efficiency and capabilities of our businesses and to maximize our economies of scale. Completion of and realization of the benefits from such improvements may be subject to many factors including, but not limited to, permitting, construction, equipment delivery, commissioning and ramp up, environmental compliance, and technology performance risks, some of which are outside our control and could result in further delays in such projects or require us to incur additional costs. Vendors may be unable to deliver on their commitments and permitting agencies may be delayed in issuing necessary permits which can cause construction, commissioning, and ramp-up time to take significantly longer than expected. For example, we have experienced some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures and in the timing of realization of the anticipated benefits of the technology improvements. We have also experienced increased commissioning and ramp-up times on some projects. Failure to realize or delays in realizing the anticipated benefits and to generate adequate returns on such capital projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe operate in industries that are cyclical and sensitive to general economic conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nDemand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our operations tends to reflect and be amplified by changes in economic conditions, both domestically and internationally, the effects of inflation, changes in interest rates, and foreign currency exchange fluctuations. Increasing interest rates, both domestically and internationally, could lead to slowdowns in global investment and production, resulting in reduced generation of scrap and decreased demand for our products. For example, export net selling prices for recycled ferrous metal decreased by approximately $230 per ton, or approximately 40%, between May and June 2022, reflecting weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, including due to the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns in China, inflationary pressure including high energy prices, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, and steel inventory destocking. Similarly, market demand for most recycled nonferrous metals softened beginning in May 2022 resulting in selling prices declining sharply for a period followed by a partial recovery near the end of fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2023, we experienced periods of market recovery, but market conditions for recycled metals were weaker overall in comparison to fiscal 2022. In addition, in fiscal 2022 and 2023, increasing inflation impacted our operating costs, including, but not limited to, employee compensation costs and certain costs of production. Economic downturns\n16 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nor a prolonged period of slow growth in the U.S. and foreign markets or any of the industries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nChanging conditions in global markets including the impact of sanctions and tariffs, quotas, and other trade actions and import restrictions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nWe generate a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the U.S., including countries in Asia, the Mediterranean region, and North, Central, and South America. In each of the last three years, exports comprised approximately 55 to 66 percent of our ferrous sales volumes and 57 to 63 percent of our nonferrous sales volumes. Our ability to sell our products profitably, or at all, into international markets is subject to a number of risks including adverse impacts of political, economic, military, terrorist, or major pandemic events; labor and social issues; legal and regulatory requirements or limitations imposed by foreign governments including quotas, tariffs, or other protectionist trade barriers, sanctions, adverse tax law changes, nationalization, currency restrictions, or import restrictions for certain types of products we export; and disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs compliance or other actions of government agencies. The occurrence of such events and conditions may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nFor example, in fiscal 2017, regulators in China began implementing the National Sword initiative involving inspections of Chinese industrial enterprises, including recyclers, in order to identify rules violations with respect to discharge of pollutants or illegally transferred scrap imports. Restrictions resulting from the National Sword initiative include a ban on certain imported recycled products, lower contamination limits for permitted recycled materials, and more comprehensive pre- and post-shipment inspection requirements. Disruptions in pre-inspection certifications and stringent inspection procedures at certain Chinese destination ports have limited access to these destinations and resulted in the renegotiation or cancellation of certain nonferrous customer contracts in connection with the redirection of such shipments to alternate destinations. Commencing July 1, 2019, China imposed further restrictions in the form of import license requirements and quotas on certain scrap products, including certain nonferrous products we sell. Chinese import licenses and quotas are issued to Chinese scrap consumers on a quarterly basis for the importation of scrap products. Since the implementation of this program, the size of import quotas has been steadily reduced on a quarter-over-quarter basis. We have continued to sell our recycled metal products into China; however, additional or modified license requirements and quotas, as well as additional product quality requirements, may be issued in the future. We believe that the potential impact on our recycling operations of the Chinese regulatory actions described above could include requirements that would necessitate additional processing and packaging of certain recycled nonferrous metal products, increased inspection and certification activities with respect to exports to China, or a change in the use of our sales channels in the event of delays in the issuance of licenses, restrictive quotas, or an outright ban on certain or all of our recycled metals products by China. As regulatory developments progress, we may need to make further investments in nonferrous processing equipment beyond existing planned investments where economically justified, incur additional costs in order to comply with new inspection requirements, or seek alternative markets for the impacted products, which may result in lower sales prices or higher costs and may adversely impact our business or results of operations.\nIn March 2018, the U.S. imposed a 25 percent tariff on certain imported steel products and a 10 percent tariff on certain imported aluminum products under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. Currently, imports from certain countries are exempt from these duties pursuant to various agreements, including quotas. These tariffs, along with other U.S. trade actions, have triggered retaliatory actions by certain affected countries, and other foreign governments may impose trade measures on other U.S. goods in the future. For example, China has imposed a series of retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. products, including a 25 percent tariff on all grades of U.S. scrap and an additional 25 percent tariff on U.S. aluminum scrap. These tariffs and other trade actions could result in a decrease in international steel demand and negatively impact demand for our products, which would adversely impact our business. Given the uncertainty regarding the scope and duration of these trade actions by the U.S. or other countries, the impact of the trade actions on our operations or results remains uncertain, but this impact could be material.\nIncreases in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies may reduce the demand for our products\nA significant portion of our recycled metal revenues is generated from sales to foreign customers, which are denominated in U.S. dollars. At times during our 2022 and 2023 fiscal years, the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to other world currencies. A strengthening U.S. dollar makes our products more expensive for non-U.S. customers, which may negatively impact our export sales. A strengthening U.S. dollar also makes imported metal products less expensive, which may result in an increase in imports of steel products into the U.S. As a result, our finished steel products, which are made in the U.S., may become more expensive for our U.S. customers relative to imported steel products thereby reducing demand for our products.\n17 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nEconomic and geopolitical instability including as a result of military conflict could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nIn late February 2022, Russian military forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, which has continued through the date of this report. We do not have operations in Russia or Ukraine. Nevertheless, the war between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by U.S. and European governments, together with any additional future sanctions by them, could have a larger impact that expands into other geographies where we do business, including our supply chain, business partners, and customers in those markets, which could result in lost sales, supply shortages, commodity price fluctuations, increased manufacturing costs, transportation logistics challenges, customer credit and liquidity issues, and lost efficiencies. The global energy crisis has been exacerbated by Russia's restrictions on energy exports which could similarly impact the geographies where we do business. In addition, the U.S. has taken certain trade actions as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which could result in retaliatory measures or actions, including tariffs, by Russia. While significant uncertainty exists with respect to this matter, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and its broader impacts, including any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade imposed by the U.S. or further retaliatory trade measures taken by Russia or other countries in response, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nChanges in the availability or price of inputs such as raw materials and end-of-life vehicles could reduce our sales\nOur businesses require certain materials that are sourced from third-party suppliers. Although the synergies from our integrated operations allow us to be our own source for some raw materials, particularly with respect to recycled metal for our steel manufacturing operations, we rely on other suppliers for most of our raw material and other input needs, including inputs to steel production such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables. Industry supply conditions generally involve risks, including the possibility of shortages of raw materials, increases in raw material and other input costs, and reduced control over delivery schedules. We procure our scrap inventory from numerous sources. These suppliers generally are not bound by long-term contracts and have no obligation to sell scrap metal to us. In periods of declining or lower recycled metal prices, suppliers may elect to hold scrap metal to wait for higher prices or intentionally slow their metal collection activities, tightening supply. The effects of competition for supply of scrap metal, including of specific grades, can significantly impact the flow of scrap volumes into our facilities, our metal spreads, and our operating margins. If a substantial number of suppliers cease selling scrap metal to us, we will be unable to recycle metal at desired levels, and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. For instance, in fiscal 2023, a slowdown in economic growth in the U.S., coupled with rising interest rates and inflation, led consumers and businesses to hold on to vehicles longer, constraining the supply of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, which resulted in significantly reduced processed volumes. A slowdown of industrial production in the U.S. may also reduce the supply of industrial grades of metal to the metals recycling industry, resulting in less recyclable metal available to process and market. Increased competition for domestic scrap metal, including as a result of overcapacity or consolidation in the metal recycling industry in the U.S. and Canada, may also reduce the supply of scrap metal available to us. Failure to obtain a steady supply of recyclable material could both adversely impact our ability to meet sales commitments and reduce our operating margins. Failure to obtain an adequate supply of end-of-life vehicles, including due to increasing trends over time in the proportion of electric vehicles sold to total vehicles sold, the pace of and the auto recycling industry response to which are uncertain, could adversely impact our ability to attract customers and charge admission fees and reduce parts sales at our auto parts stores. For example, cars purchased by our auto parts stores decreased by 8% in both fiscal 2022 and 2023, in each case compared to the prior fiscal year. Failure to obtain raw materials and other inputs to steel production, such as graphite electrodes, alloys, and other required consumables, could adversely impact our ability to make steel to the specifications of our customers.\nSignificant decreases in recycled metal prices may adversely impact our operating results\nThe timing and magnitude of the cycles in the industries in which we operate are difficult to predict and are influenced by different economic conditions in the domestic market, where we typically acquire our raw materials, and foreign markets, where we typically sell the majority of our products. Purchase prices for scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles and selling prices for recycled metal are subject to market forces beyond our control. While we attempt to respond to changing recycled metal selling prices through adjustments to our metal purchase prices, our ability to do so is limited by competitive and other market factors. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our metal purchase prices to fully offset a sharp reduction in recycled metal sales prices, which may adversely impact our operating income and cash flows. In addition, a rapid decrease in selling prices may compress our operating margins due to the impact of average inventory cost accounting, which causes cost of goods sold recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to decrease at a slower rate than metal purchase prices. For instance, in fiscal 2022, after rising strongly and reaching a peak in April 2022, market selling prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metals declined sharply in May through June, reflecting weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, including due to the impact of China COVID-19 lockdowns, inflationary pressure including high energy prices, the strength of the U.S. Dollar, and steel inventory destocking. For example, export net selling prices for recycled ferrous metal decreased by approximately $230 per ton, or approximately 40%, between May and June 2022, causing our operating margins to compress significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Ferrous export net selling prices decreased further between the fourth quarter\n18 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nof fiscal 2022 and the first quarter of fiscal 2023, which contributed to the sequential decrease in our quarterly results between those periods.\nImbalances in supply and demand conditions in the global steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nEconomic expansions and contractions in global economies can result in supply and demand imbalances in the global steel industry that can significantly affect the price of commodities used and sold by our business, as well as the price of and demand for finished steel products. In a number of foreign countries, such as China, steel producers are generally government-owned and may therefore make production decisions based on political or other factors that do not reflect free market conditions. In fiscal 2023 as well as in the past, overcapacity and excess steel production in these foreign countries resulted in the export of aggressively priced semi-finished and finished steel products. This led to disruptions in steel-making operations within other countries, negatively impacting demand for our recycled metal products used by EAF mills globally as their primary feedstock. Further, the import of foreign steel products into the U.S. at similarly aggressive prices have in the past adversely impacted finished steel sales prices and sales volumes. Existing or new trade laws and regulations may cause or be inadequate to prevent disadvantageous trade practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Although trade regulations restrict or impose duties on the importation of certain products, if foreign steel production significantly exceeds consumption in those countries, global demand for our recycled metal products could decline and imports of steel products into the U.S. could increase, resulting in lower volumes and selling prices for our recycled metal products and finished steel products.\nAcquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions of or expand into complementary businesses to enable us to expand our customer and supplier base and grow our revenues. Execution of any past or potential future acquisition or expansion involves several risks, including:\nDifficulty integrating the acquired businesses personnel and operations;\nChallenges in obtaining permits or meeting other regulatory requirements;\nPotential loss of key employees, customers, or suppliers of the acquired business;\nDifficulties in realizing anticipated cost savings, efficiencies, and synergies;\nUnexpected costs;\nInaccurate assessment of or undisclosed liabilities;\nInability to maintain uniform standards, controls, and procedures;\nDisruption to existing businesses; and\nDifficulty in managing growth.\nIf we do not successfully execute on acquisitions or expansions and the acquired or expanded businesses do not perform as projected, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nSupply chain disruptions affecting our customers, end users of our recycled products, or our suppliers could adversely impact the demand for our products or the availability of inputs, increase our costs, or otherwise adversely impact our business\nSupply chain disruptions and related labor shortages and logistics constraints have and could continue to impact our customers, end users of our recycled products, and our suppliers and adversely impact our business. Direct and indirect impacts on our business of such supply chain disruptions could include reduction in the demand for and price of certain of our products, slowdown in flows of scrap metal from certain supply channels, and reduced availability or increases in costs of other inputs, consumables, supplies, and capital equipment. Disruptions within our logistics or supply chain network could adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products in a timely manner, which could impair our ability to meet customer demand for products and result in reduced volumes and sales, increased supply chain costs, or damage to our reputation. Such disruptions in the future may result from a number of factors beyond our control. Supply chain disruptions due to any of those factors could negatively impact our financial performance or financial condition.\nReliance on third-party shipping companies may restrict our ability to ship our products\nWe significantly rely on third parties to handle and transport raw materials to our production facilities and products to customers. Despite our practice of utilizing a diversified group of suppliers of transportation, factors beyond our control, including changes in fuel prices, political events, governmental regulation of transportation, changes in market rates, carrier availability, carrier bankruptcy, labor\n19 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nshortages, shipping industry consolidation, and disruptions in transportation routes and infrastructure, may adversely impact our ability to ship our products and our operating margins. These impacts could include delays or other disruptions in shipments in transit, including as a result of congested seaports and travel routes, or third-party shipping companies increasing their charges for transportation services or otherwise reducing or eliminating the availability of their containers, vehicles, rail cars, barges, or ships. For example, during fiscal 2022 and 2021, worldwide demand for logistical services increased sharply, which led to a global shortage of available shipping containers, congested seaports, and higher freight rates, impacting the timing of certain shipments and resulting in reductions in sales volumes of certain products. The delays in container shipping for U.S. exports were exacerbated by the backlog of containerized imports at U.S. seaports. While we aim to pass on the majority of shipping and related charges to our customers, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so into the future. As a result, we may not be able to transport our products in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may harm our reputation.\nImpairment of assets other than goodwill may adversely affect our operating results\nOur long-lived asset groups are subject to an impairment assessment when certain triggering events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the operations related to the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value. The results of these tests for potential impairment, as well as the number and frequency of identified triggering events indicating potential impairment, may be adversely affected by unfavorable market conditions, our financial performance trends, or an increase in interest rates, among other factors. If, as a result of the impairment test, we determine that the fair value of any of our long-lived asset groups is less than its carrying amount, we may incur an impairment charge that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to goodwill and long-lived assets, we carry other assets on our balance sheet that are subject to impairment testing and potential loss recognition in accordance with applicable accounting standards. These other assets include, but are not limited to, investments in the equity of unconsolidated entities, assets held for sale, and assets abandoned either before or after they are placed in service. We recorded impairment charges totaling $11 million on assets other than goodwill in fiscal 2023, comprising primarily $5 million relating to an equity investment and $5 million relating to capitalized implementation costs for an abandoned cloud computing arrangement. Impairment of assets other than goodwill, if incurred in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail on long-lived asset impairment charges.\nPublic health emergencies, such as pandemics or epidemics, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows\nOur operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics, or other public health emergencies. Such events could lead to restrictions and mandates, which could be applied differently across jurisdictions, and there could be global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from such an event including labor shortages, logistical challenges, and supply chain disruptions such as increased port congestion, and increases in costs for certain goods and services. For instance, the onset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, which the World Health Organization characterized as a global public health emergency from March 2020 through May 2023, negatively affected our business and ongoing global impacts have negatively affected our sales volumes, operating costs, and financial results to varying degrees and could continue to negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position in the future.\nInability to achieve or sustain the benefits from productivity, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives may adversely impact our operating results\nDuring the past several years, we implemented a number of productivity improvement, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses and improve profitability and to achieve further integration and synergistic cost efficiencies in our operating platform. These initiatives included idling underutilized assets and closing facilities to more closely align our business to market conditions, implementing productivity initiatives to increase production efficiency and material recovery, and reducing certain operating expenses through headcount reductions, reducing organizational layers, consolidating shared service functions, savings from procurement activities, streamlining of administrative and supporting services functions, and other non-headcount measures. For example, in October 2022, we announced and began implementing productivity and cost reduction initiatives with a targeted annual benefit of approximately $40 million, and in January 2023, we announced incremental initiatives aiming to reduce selling, general, and administrative costs by approximately $20 million annually. These initiatives aim to improve profitability through a combination of increased yields, efficiencies in processing, procurement, and pricing, and reduced costs including from headcount reductions, decreased lease costs, professional and outside services, and implementation of operational efficiencies. We may undertake similar or additional productivity initiatives in the future in the normal course or in response to market conditions. Our ability to achieve or sustain the anticipated cost reductions and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and\n20 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nassumptions. These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive, and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. We have incurred, and may incur in the future, restructuring charges and other exit-related activities as a result of such initiatives. Failure to achieve or sustain the expected cost reductions and other benefits related to these productivity improvements, cost savings, and restructuring initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be unable to renew facility leases, thus restricting our ability to operate\nWe lease a significant portion of our facilities, including the substantial majority of our auto parts facilities. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly, and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Failure to renew these leases or find suitable alternative locations for our facilities may impact our ability to continue operations within certain geographic areas, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nChanging economic conditions may result in customers not fulfilling their contractual obligations\nWe enter into export ferrous sales contracts preceded by negotiations that include fixing price, quantity, shipping terms, and other contractual terms. Upon finalization of these terms and satisfactory completion of other contractual contingencies, the customer typically opens a letter of credit to satisfy its payment obligation under the contract prior to our shipment of the cargo. In times of changing economic conditions, including during periods of sharply falling recycled metal prices and global financial instability, there is an increased risk that customers may not be willing or able to fulfill their contractual obligations or open letters of credit. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, 38% and 24%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit. In addition, in higher or rising commodity price environments and during periods of challenging global macroeconomic and steel industry conditions, we have experienced proportionately lower credit insurance coverage of applicable customer credit limits, which may increase our exposure to customer credit risk.\nPotential limitations on our ability to access capital resources may restrict our ability to operate\nOur operations are capital intensive. Our business also requires substantial expenditures for routine maintenance. While we expect that our cash requirements, including the funding of capital expenditures, debt service, dividends, share repurchases, and investments, will be financed by internally generated funds or from borrowings under our secured committed bank credit facilities, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Additional acquisitions could require financing from external sources. Although we believe we have adequate access to contractually committed borrowings, we could be adversely affected if we are not able to meet the conditions required to incur such borrowing or if our banks ceased lending or were unable to honor their contractual commitments. Failure to access our credit facilities could restrict our ability to fund operations, make capital expenditures, or execute acquisitions.\nThe agreement governing our bank credit facilities imposes certain restrictions on our business and contains financial covenants\nOur secured bank credit facilities contain certain restrictions on our business which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business or execute our strategy and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. Our bank credit agreement also requires that we maintain certain financial and other covenants, including a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a consolidated leverage ratio. Our ability to comply with these covenants may also be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or financial covenants could result in an event of default under the bank credit agreement and permit our lenders to cease lending to us and declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. This could require us to refinance our bank facilities, which we may not be able to do at terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nConsolidation in the steel industry may reduce demand for our products\nThere has been consolidation in the steel industry that has included steel mills acquiring steel fabricators to ensure demand for their products. If any of our steel mills significant remaining customers were to be acquired by competing steel mills, this could reduce the demand for our products and force us to lower our prices, reducing our revenues, or to reduce production, which could increase our unit costs and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n21 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nProduct liability claims may adversely impact our operating results\nWe could inadvertently acquire radioactive scrap metal that could potentially be included in recycled mixed metal shipped to consumers worldwide. Although we have invested in radiation detection equipment in the majority of our locations, including the facilities from which we ship directly to customers, failure to detect radioactive metal remains a possibility. Even though we maintain insurance to address the risk of this failure in detection, there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage would be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, if we fail to meet contractual requirements for a product, we may be subject to product warranty costs and claims. These costs and claims could both have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to legal proceedings and legal compliance risks that may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity\nWe spend substantial resources ensuring that we comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, contractual obligations and other legal standards. Notwithstanding this, we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks in respect of various matters, including regulatory, safety, environmental, employment, transportation, intellectual property, contractual, import/export, international trade, and governmental matters that arise in the course of our business and in our industry. For example, legal proceedings can include those arising from accidents involving Company-owned vehicles, including Company tractor trailers. In some instances, such accidents and the related litigation involve accidents that have resulted in third-party fatalities. An outcome in an unusual or significant legal proceeding or compliance investigation in excess of insurance recoveries could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For information regarding our current significant legal proceedings and contingencies, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Contingencies - Other in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nClimate change may adversely impact our facilities and our ongoing operations\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain and depend upon the unique geographic and environmental factors present, for example rising sea levels at our deepwater port facilities, changing storm patterns and intensities, and changing temperature levels. As many of our recycling facilities are located near deepwater ports, rising sea levels may disrupt our ability to receive scrap metal, process the metal through our shredders, and ship products to our customers. Extreme weather events and conditions, such as wildfires, hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, and snow or ice storms, may increase our costs or cause damage to our facilities, and any damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. Increased frequency and duration of adverse weather events and conditions may also inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal inflows to our recycling facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Potential adverse impacts from climate change, including rising temperatures and extreme weather events and conditions, may create health and safety issues for employees operating at our facilities and may lead to an inability to maintain standard operating hours.\nWe may not realize our deferred tax assets in the future\nThe assessment of recoverability of our deferred tax assets is based on an evaluation of existing positive and negative evidence as to whether it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. If negative evidence outweighs positive evidence, a valuation allowance is required. Factors that may result in a valuation allowance include significant negative industry or economic trends, a decrease in earnings performance and projections of future taxable income, adverse changes in laws or regulations, and a variety of other factors. Recording a valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition. In the past, we have recorded significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets may require further valuation allowances if it is not more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nTax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial results\nAs a company conducting business on a global basis with physical operations throughout North America, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local, and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. The IRA also creates a number of potentially beneficial tax credits to incentivize investments in certain technologies and industries which may be applicable to our business. Certain provisions of the IRA became effective in fiscal 2023. As of August 31, 2023, we did not meet the threshold to be subject to the 15% minimum tax. We may, however, be subject to the 1% excise tax on future share repurchases.\n22 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nOne or more cybersecurity incidents may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, and reputation\nOur operations involve the use of multiple systems, some of which are outsourced to certain third-party service and hosting providers, that process, store, and transmit sensitive information about our customers, suppliers, employees, financial position, operating results, and strategies. We face global cybersecurity risks and threats on a continual and ongoing basis, which include, but are not limited to, attempts to access systems and information, computer viruses, or denial-of-service attacks. These risks and threats range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures. Increased numbers of employees working remotely increases our exposure to cyber-threats. While we are not aware of any material cyber-attacks or breaches of our systems to date, such attempts occur regularly and, thus, we have and continue to implement measures to safeguard our systems and information and mitigate potential risks, including employee training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks, but there is no assurance that such actions will be sufficient to prevent cyber-attacks or security breaches that manipulate or improperly use our systems, compromise sensitive information, destroy or corrupt data, or otherwise disrupt our operations. The occurrence of such events, including breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers, could negatively impact our reputation and our competitive position and could result in litigation with third parties, regulatory action, loss of business due to disruption of operations and/or reputational damage, potential liability and increased remediation and protection costs, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, as cybersecurity threats become more sophisticated, we may need to increase our investments in security measures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business and financial results\nIncreasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to ESG matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote ESG-related change at public companies, including, but not limited to, through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, pension funds, universities and other members of the investing community.\nThese activities have also aimed to increase the attention on and demand for action related to various ESG matters, which has contributed to increasing societal, investor, and legislative focus and pressure on ESG practices and disclosures, including those related to climate change, GHG emissions targets, business resilience under the assumptions of demand-constrained scenarios, net-zero ambitions, transition plans, actions related to diversity and inclusion, political activities, racial equity audits, and governance standards. As a result, we may face increasing pressure regarding our ESG practices and disclosures. Investors, stakeholders, and other interested parties are also increasingly focusing on issues related to environmental justice. This has resulted and is likely to continue to result in increased scrutiny with respect to our business and operations, which could in turn result in the cancellation or delay of projects, the revocation or delay of permits, termination of contracts, lawsuits, regulatory action, and policy change that may adversely affect our business strategy, increase our costs, and adversely affect our reputation and financial performance.\nResponding to such ESG-focused activism has been and will likely continue to be costly and time-consuming. Such response efforts could also result in the implementation of certain ESG practices and/or disclosure requirements that may present a heightened level of legal and regulatory risk, or that threaten our credibility with other investors and stakeholders. The methodologies and standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been standardized, and continue to evolve. As a result, our ESG-related disclosures, metrics, and targets may not necessarily be calculated in the same manner or comparable to similarly titled measures presented by us in other contexts, or by other companies or third-party estimates. While we believe that our ESG disclosures and methodologies reflect our business strategy and are reasonable at the time made or used, as our business or applicable methodologies, standards, or regulations develop and evolve, we may revise or cease reporting or using certain disclosures and methodologies if we determine that they are no longer advisable or appropriate. If our ESG disclosures and methodologies are or are perceived by government authorities, investors, or stakeholders to be inadequate, inaccurate, or non-compliant with applicable standards or regulations, or if we discover material inaccuracies therein, our reputation could be negatively impacted, and we could be exposed to litigation and other regulatory actions.\nWe are exposed to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nOur operations in Canada expose us to translation risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as compared to the U.S. dollar, our reporting currency. As a result, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks due to exchange rate movements in connection with the translation of the operating costs and the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations into our functional currency for inclusion in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n23 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nWe may incur losses and additional costs as a result of our hedging transactions\nWe currently use interest rate swap derivative instruments, as well as derivative contracts for commodities used in normal business operations that are settled by physical delivery, and we expect to continue their use in the future. If the instruments we use to hedge our exposure to various types of risk are not effective or increase our exposure to unexpected events or risks, we may incur losses. In addition, we may be required to incur additional costs in connection with any future regulation of derivative instruments applicable to us.\nRisk Factors Relating to the Regulatory Environment\nGovernmental agencies may refuse to grant or renew our licenses and permits, thus restricting our ability to operate\nWe conduct certain aspects of our operations subject to licenses, permits, and approvals from state and local governments. Governmental agencies often resist the establishment of certain types of facilities in their communities, including metal recycling and auto parts facilities. Increased permitting requirements could require substantial additional capital expenditures, impose financial assurance obligations, subject us to increased compliance and penalty risks, severely limit operational flexibility, and increase operating costs, or adversely impact our ability to acquire or sell materials. Increased focus on strengthening environmental compliance and enforcement in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects may impact our ability to obtain or renew licenses and permits for facilities in or near such communities. In addition, changes in zoning and increased residential and mixed-use development near our facilities are reducing the buffer zones and creating land use conflicts with heavy industrial uses such as ours. This could result in increased complaints, increased inspections and enforcement including fines and penalties, operating restrictions, the need for additional capital expenditures, and increased opposition to maintaining or renewing required approvals, licenses, and permits. In addition, waste products from our operations are subject to classification and regulations that, among other things, determine how such materials may be handled, stored, transported, and disposed. Failure to obtain or maintain regulatory permits, approvals, or exemptions for such waste could materially increase our costs or limit our operations. For example, in fiscal 2022, as a result of court orders and regulatory changes, we were required at times to transport shredder waste from our Oakland facility out of state for disposal at increased costs. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As an additional example, our Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) permit to operate currently limits the number of ships that may call at our Oakland, California facility to 26 ships per year. In July 2018, we applied for a modification of such permit to increase the number of annual ship calls to 32 per year. BAAQMD has not acted on our permit modification request but, in the interim, had routinely issued annual Compliance and Settlement Agreements (CSA) to permit 32 ship calls in each year. In October 2022, however, BAAQMD declined to renew the CSA for 2022, following which we applied for and obtained a short-term variance authorizing the 32 ship calls in calendar year 2022. Unless we are able to operate within the current 26 ship call limit in calendar year 2023, we will need to apply for a similar variance for 2023. Failure to obtain such a variance in the future could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations due to the reduced marine shipments, and lost profits related thereto. Additionally, by letter dated June 22, 2023, ODEQ notified the Company that it intended to reopen the Companys Title V permit at the steel mill for purposes of incorporating the emissions of a third-party contractor that has operated on a portion of the site for decades. We have objected to such action and are engaged in discussions with ODEQ.\nFurthermore, from time to time, both the U.S. and foreign governments impose regulations and restrictions on trade in the markets in which we operate. In some countries, governments require us to apply for certificates or registration before allowing shipment of recycled metal to customers in those countries. There can be no assurance that future approvals, licenses, and permits will be granted or that we will be able to maintain and renew the approvals, licenses, and permits we currently hold. Failure to obtain these approvals could cause us to limit or discontinue operations in these locations or prevent us from developing or acquiring new facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nCompliance with environmental laws and regulations is a significant factor in our business. We are subject to local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries relating to, among other matters:\nWaste disposal;\nAir emissions;\nWaste water and storm water management, treatment, and discharge;\nThe use and treatment of groundwater;\nSoil and groundwater contamination and remediation;\n24 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nGeneration, discharge, storage, handling, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials and secondary materials;\nEmployee health and safety; and\nClimate change generally.\nWe are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain operations. Violation of or failure to obtain permits or comply with these laws or regulations could result in our business being fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators or becoming subject to litigation by private parties. In recent years, capital expenditures for environmental projects have increased and have represented a significant share of our annual capital expenditures. Future environmental compliance costs, including capital expenditures for environmental projects, may increase because of new laws and regulations, changing regulatory interpretations and stricter enforcement of current laws and regulations by regulatory authorities, expanding emissions, groundwater, storm water and other testing requirements, and new information on emission or contaminant levels including with respect to emerging contaminants such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), uncertainty regarding adequate pollution control levels, the future costs of pollution control technology, and issues related to climate change.\nWe have seen an increased focus by federal, state, and local regulators on metals recycling and auto dismantling facilities and new or expanding regulatory requirements. For example, the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) has increased its enforcement actions and sought to impose additional permitting and regulatory requirements on the metals recycling industry in the state that has resulted in and could in the future increase operating and compliance costs and require additional capital expenditures. In addition, in July 2021, the EPA issued an enforcement alert reflecting a national enforcement initiative in conjunction with state regulators focused on Clean Air Act compliance at metal recycling facilities that operate auto and scrap metal shredders. While we believe we are an industry leader in air emission controls and have been working with state and local regulators on compliance and permitting matters, we have in the past and may in the future be subject to enforcement actions or litigation by regulators or private parties that could result in additional penalties, compliance requirements, or capital investments. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of this report.\nIn addition, previous operations by us, predecessor entities, or others at facilities that we currently or formerly owned, operated, or otherwise used may have caused contamination from hazardous substances. As a result, we are exposed to possible claims, including government fines and penalties, costs for investigation and clean-up activities, claims for natural resources damages, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage, under environmental laws and regulations, especially for the remediation of waterways and soil or groundwater contamination. These laws can impose liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances even if the owner or operator was neither aware of nor responsible for the release of the hazardous substances. We have, in the past, incurred liabilities, expenditures, fines and penalties associated with violations of certain of these laws and regulations. In December 2000, we were notified by the EPA that we are one of the potentially responsible parties that owns or operates, or formerly owned or operated, sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. Environmental compliance costs and potential environmental liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. See also the risk factor Potential costs related to the environmental cleanup of Portland Harbor may be material to our financial position and liquidity in this Item 1A and Contingencies - Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nThe U.S. Federal Government and state and local regulators are also emphasizing efforts to strengthen environmental compliance and enforcement, including with respect to clean-up actions under superfund and hazardous waste laws, in overburdened communities that may be disproportionately impacted by adverse health and environmental effects. On September 10, 2021, U.S. EPA Region 9 and the California Environmental Protection Agency announced a joint effort to expand environmental enforcement in overburdened California communities. These initiatives could result in increased enforcement, compliance, and clean-up costs, including increased capital expenditures, at our facilities located at or near such communities.\nCompliance with existing and future climate change, greenhouse gas, and other air emission laws and regulations may adversely impact our operating results\nRecent and future legislation or increased regulation regarding climate change and GHG emissions could impose significant costs on our business and our customers and suppliers, including increased energy, capital equipment, emissions controls, environmental monitoring and reporting, and other costs in order to comply with laws and regulations concerning and limitations imposed on climate change and GHG emissions. The potential costs of allowances, taxes, fees, offsets, or credits or additional emission reduction measures that may be part of cap and trade programs or other legislative or regulatory requirements are still uncertain and the future of these programs or measures is unknown. For example, in March 2020, the Governor of Oregon issued an executive order directing state\n25 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nagencies to take certain actions to reduce and regulate GHG emissions. Pursuant to this executive order, ODEQ adopted a new Climate Protection Program to limit GHG emissions in the state including from large stationary sources such as our steel mill. Pursuant to these regulations, the mills GHG process emissions will be subject to a best available emission reduction technology analysis and standard and its natural gas GHG combustion emissions will be subject to the cap and annual reductions applied to its natural gas supplier. The implementation of such regulations, standards, and programs and any associated costs, including any operating or capital expenditures, are uncertain, but may be material to our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. The potential increased costs to us of natural gas supplies are also uncertain. In addition, the ODEQ Cleaner Air Oregon (CAO) program regulates toxic air emissions from manufacturing and commercial facilities located in Oregon. The ODEQ has published a prioritization list of the facilities within the state subject to the CAO program based on emissions inventories that facilities submitted to the ODEQ. The prioritization list established four tiers of risk groups. Our steel mill has been assigned to the first-tier risk group and entered the CAO program in 2020. To comply with the existing CAO program rules, and as they may be revised in the future, we must undertake an emissions inventory and a public health risk assessment for both our steel mill and our Portland metals recycling facility. We may be required to incur additional operating or capital expenditures to mitigate any significant identified emissions risks, and such expenditures may be material. In addition, we have and continue to incur material capital expenditures to enclose and install additional emission controls for our shredders to meet air emission standards. Recent and future climate change and GHG laws or regulations could negatively impact our ability (and that of our customers and suppliers) to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such requirements. Until the timing, scope, and extent of any future laws or regulations becomes known, we cannot predict the effect on our financial condition, operating performance, or ability to compete. Furthermore, even without such laws or regulations, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the metals recycling and steel manufacturing industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our products.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Employees\nLabor shortages or increased labor costs may adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows\nOur employees contribute to developing and meeting our business goals and objectives, and labor is a significant component of operating our business. The impact of labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, unemployment levels and benefits, higher employee turnover rates, increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers compensation insurance), may increase our costs or impede our ability to operate our facilities and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. As a result of the tight labor markets we have experienced since fiscal 2021, we have received fewer job applicants in certain local markets, which, at times, hindered our ability to reach full staffing levels at some of our facilities. Recruiting and retaining employees in sufficient numbers to optimally staff our facilities may result in increases in our labor costs.\nReliance on employees subject to collective bargaining may restrict our ability to operate\nApproximately 23% of our full-time employees are represented by unions under collective bargaining agreements, including substantially all of the manufacturing employees at our steel manufacturing facility. As these agreements expire, we may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements of such agreements on acceptable terms. Any failure to reach an agreement with one or more of our unions may result in strikes, lockouts, or other labor actions, including work slowdowns or stoppages, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe underfunded status of our multiemployer pension plans may cause us to increase our contributions to the plans\nAs discussed in Note 13 - Employee Benefits in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report, we contribute to the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan (WISPP), a multiemployer plan benefiting union employees of our steel mill. Because we have no current intention of withdrawing from the WISPP, we have not recognized a withdrawal liability in our consolidated financial statements. However, if such a liability were triggered, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, liquidity, and cash flows. Our contributions to the WISPP could also increase as a result of a diminished contribution base due to the insolvency or withdrawal of other employers who currently contribute to it, the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liabilities, or other funding deficiencies, as we would need to fund the retirement obligations of these employers.\n26 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING ITEM 1B.

For further discussion of our operating properties, see Business, and Distribution in Part I, Item 1 of this report. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of business involving normal and routine claims, including environmental compliance matters. Such proceedings include, but are not limited to, proceedings relating to our status as a potentially responsible party with respect to the Portland Harbor Superfund Site and proceedings relating to other legacy environmental issues. For additional information regarding such matters, see Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nIn fiscal 2013, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts advised us of alleged violations of environmental requirements, including but not limited to those related to air emissions and hazardous waste management, at our operations in the Commonwealth. We actively engaged in discussions with the Commonwealth's representatives, which resulted in a settlement agreement to resolve the alleged violations. A consent judgment was jointly filed with and entered by the Superior Court for the County of Suffolk, Commonwealth of Massachusetts on September 24, 2015. The settlement involved a $450 thousand cash payment, an additional $450 thousand in suspended payments to be waived upon completion of a shredder emission control system and certain other specified milestones, and $350 thousand in supplemental environmental projects that we have completed. In fiscal 2021, the upgraded shredder emission control system became fully operational to design criteria, and the adjusted milestones for waiver of the suspended penalties were met.\nOn February 23, 2021, the California State Department of Toxic Substance Control (DTSC) issued a corrective action enforcement order with respect to our metal recycling facility in Oakland, California that would require us to submit a current conditions report, to undertake a facilities investigation, risk assessment, a corrective measures study, and to implement corrective measures selected by the DTSC based on those assessments and studies. We dispute DTSCs alleged jurisdictional basis for the order, as well as the scope of work required by the order, which we believe is unwarranted and duplicative of ongoing assessments being conducted under the oversight of another state agency. We have filed a notice of defense that by law stays the effectiveness of the order and are challenging the order through the DTSC administrative process.\nIn addition, the DTSC issued a similar corrective action enforcement order on March 18, 2021 with respect to our metal recycling facility in Fresno, California based on inspections conducted by the DTSC in 2013. That 2013 inspection resulted in the issuance of a Summary of Violations in 2015 setting forth a number of alleged violations relating to hazardous waste management requirements. While we dispute the alleged violations, we engaged in settlement discussions that had resulted in a tentative agreement in April 2018 to settle the matter for $490 thousand, of which $368 thousand was to be paid as a civil penalty and $122 thousand was to be paid as reimbursement for agency investigation and enforcement costs. However, the parties were not able to reach agreement on the injunctive terms of the settlement agreement, and the California Office of the Attorney General (COAG), on behalf of DTSC, filed suit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Fresno on June 25, 2020 against Schnitzer Fresno, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, which operates the facility, seeking a permanent injunction and civil penalties. In early 2022, the parties agreed to formal mediation of the dispute, which effort was unsuccessful. However, we were able to resume settlement negotiations with DTSC, and settlement was achieved in January 2023. A Stipulated Judgement resolving the case was entered by the Fresno County Superior Court on January 18, 2023. The settlement terms include payment of a penalty of $525 thousand, specified injunctive relief requirements, and completion of site investigation and remediation requirements depending on the outcome of the investigation and risk assessment.\nIn January 2018, the Company received a finding of violation letter from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) with respect to alleged violations of environmental requirements stemming from refrigerant recovery management program inspections at 12 of our facilities in the New England and Pacific Northwest regions in July 2017 and November 2017. Except with respect to a minor and now corrected non-compliance matter at one facility, we believe that we were in compliance with the relevant regulations. Nevertheless, in December 2017 and prior to receipt of the USEPA letter, we implemented improvements to our refrigerant recovery management program to further strengthen that program, including improvements to address concerns raised by USEPA during the inspections. We conferred with USEPA and the United States Department of Justice (USDOJ) regarding the alleged violations and reached agreement to settle this matter. On April 21, 2022, the USDOJ on behalf of the USEPA filed a Complaint and lodged a Consent Decree reflecting the terms of the agreed settlement with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, which Consent Decree was entered as a final judgment by the Court on June 23, 2022. Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the Company agreed to settle the matter without admitting any liability with respect to the allegations in the Complaint for a civil penalty of $1.55 million, implementation of an approved, further enhanced refrigerant recovery management program, and execution of a R-12 refrigerant destruction mitigation project. The Company has implemented the USEPA approved enhanced refrigerant recovery management program at its metals recycling facilities, implemented the mitigation project and paid the civil penalty on July 18, 2022.\n29 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nIn January 2020, the USEPA issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) based on its evaluation of data requested during a June 2019 inspection at our facility in Oakland, California alleging the same violation of a Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) air emissions rule that was the subject of a Compliance and Settlement Agreement (CSA) with BAAQMD that was executed as of September 22, 2020 and also alleging violations of Title V Major Source permitting requirements based on source testing results of the enclosed shredder. The CSA required the installation of new emission controls for volatile organic compounds (VOCs), the payment of a civil penalty and excess emissions fees totaling $400 thousand, and the provision of certain VOC offsets. The Company timely filed an application for a Title V Major Source Permit and simultaneously filed an application for Synthetic Minor Operating Permit based on the proposed installation of Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers and acid gas scrubbers. The Company maintains that the timely filing of a Title V Major Source permit application constitutes compliance with Title V Major Source rules and that USEPAs Title V non-compliance allegations are erroneous. The Company has conveyed that position to USEPA and has provided USEPA with documentation requested by USEPA confirming our position. To date, USEPA has taken no further action relating to the NOV. In addition, the Company has completed installation of new VOC emissions controls that have achieved compliance with the BAAQMD emissions rule. Accordingly, the Company does not believe that federal enforcement of the BAAQMD rule or Title V permitting requirements is warranted.\nOn September 3, 2021, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) issued a Pre-Enforcement Notice (PEN) alleging that the Companys metal shredder facility in Portland, Oregon was in violation of Title V of the federal Clean Air Act (CAA). In the PEN, ODEQ also alleged violations of major source new source review, CAO and federal hazardous air pollutant control technology requirements and gave notice to the Company that ODEQ had referred the matter to USEPA for review and possible formal enforcement. On April 25, 2022, the Company received an Information Request from USEPA, Region 10 under Section 114 of the CAA with respect to both the Portland shredder facility and the Tacoma metal shredder facility. The Company has responded to the Information Request. In our response, we identified why Title V does not apply to the Portland and Tacoma facilities, explained that we had submitted an application to ODEQ in December 2018 for an Air Contaminant Discharge Permit for the Portland facility with plant site emission limits that would limit emissions to less than Title V thresholds, noted that the Tacoma facility operates pursuant to an Order of Approval issued by the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency, described that we were proactively enclosing the shredders and installing particulate and volatile organic compound controls at both facilities, and included information on the permit applications that had been submitted in connection with the enclosure and emission control projects. The Company does not believe that any enforcement action is warranted in this matter. ODEQ issued a separate information request for the Portland facility on December 8, 2022, and EPA transmitted a letter to the Company on December 20, 2022, indicating that ODEQ would assume lead agency status for potential enforcement. We responded to the ODEQ information request on January 12, 2023, and submitted additional information on April 13, 2023. The Company has disputed ODEQ's allegations concerning the violations and is currently in negotiations regarding resolution of this matter. If additional emissions controls are required at either or both of the facilities, the costs of installation could be material to our results of operations and cash flows.\nOn June 22, 2023, ODEQ issued two separate letters to the Company concerning the steel mills Title V permit. In the first letter, ODEQ alleged violations related to fluoride and hydrogen fluoride emissions and also claimed a failure to fully implement a pollution prevention plan. The Company has filed a notice of contested case and is in discussions with ODEQ to resolve this matter. In the second letter, ODEQ notified the Company of its intent to reopen the steel mills Title V permit to include a third-party contractors emissions that has operated on a portion of the mill property for decades and to add a greenhouse gas plant site emissions limit compliance monitoring requirement to the Title V permit. The Company has contested ODEQs actions and is in discussions to resolve this matter.\nOn August 5, 2020, The Athletics Investment Group LLC (As) filed an action in the California Superior Court for the County of Alameda against the DTSC as Respondent and the Company as Real Party in Interest, seeking rescission of the f letter pursuant to which DTSC classified treated shredder waste from the Companys metal shredding facility in Oakland, California as a nonhazardous waste which among other things permits its use as alternative daily cover at municipal landfills. Pursuant to determinations under section 66260.200(f) of the state hazardous waste regulations issued in 1988 and 1989 (the f letters), the DTSC determined that treated shredder waste from the Companys facility does not pose a significant hazard to human health, safety, or the environment. The Superior Court on April 16, 2021 issued an order and writ of mandate commanding the DTSC within 30 days to rescind the Companys f letters concluding that, under a law enacted by the legislature in 2014, the DTSC had a mandatory duty to rescind the f letters. The Superior Court reached this decision despite a determination by DTSC in 2018 pursuant to the 2014 statute reconfirming that treated shredder residue does not need to be managed as a hazardous waste in order to protect human health, safety, or the environment. Following the lifting of an initial stay of that order, DTSC rescinded the Companys f letters on November 29, 2021. As a result of the April 16, 2021 Superior Court order and subsequent orders by the same Superior Court, the Company has at times been required to transport its shredder waste out of state for disposal at increased costs. The Company filed notices of appeal of the Superior Court's orders, and on September 30, 2022 the California State Court of Appeals, First Appellate District, Division Three reversed the April 16, 2021 Superior Court order, holding that the statute does not impose a mandatory duty on DTSC to rescind the Companys f letters and that DTSC could continue to regulate metal shredder waste through statutorily compliant f letters since DTSCs analysis confirmed this waste need not be classified as hazardous to protect human health and the environment. DTSC subsequently agreed to an alternative treatment\n30 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nstandard for the shredder waste under an existing statutory exclusion, which allowed the Company to cease transporting its shredder waste out of state. Following the California Supreme Courts denial of review of the Court of Appeals decision, the Company immediately sought reinstatement of its f letters. On April 3, 2023, the Company received confirmation from DTSC that the f letters are in effect, subject to certain conditions.\nOn December 10, 2021, an emergency regulation (CTMSR Regulation) that allows metal shredding facilities to transport and dispose of treated shredder residue as non-hazardous waste under a conditional exclusion became effective, and the Company shipped treated shredder residue for use as alternative daily cover at municipal landfills in California from late December 2021 to September 7, 2022 when the emergency regulation expired. Following an inspection by the DTSC of the Companys Oakland metal shredding facility on May 16 and 17, 2022, the Company in its compilation and review of records requested by the DTSC during that inspection discovered and promptly self-disclosed to the DTSC that it is unable to confirm that it was in compliance with certain aspects of the CTMSR Regulation for certain periods since the adoption of the emergency regulation. The Company reported the corrective actions it has taken and the numerous detailed procedures that are now in place to prevent recurrence. The Company is confident that any failure to comply with the CTMSR Regulation did not pose a risk to human health or the environment. On August 31, 2022, the DTSC issued an Inspection Report detailing alleged violations including allegations that the Company treated and stored metal shredder residue without a permit or other grant of authorization in violation of the California Hazardous Waste Control Law (HWCL). The Company had previously discussed with DTSC the various forms of authorization that would satisfy the CTMSR Regulation and had promptly obtained a Permit by Rule under the HCWL which it understood to be a satisfactory option. In a September 14, 2022 letter, the Company responded in detail to the alleged violations setting forth the corrective actions it has taken including having obtained interim status authorization for the treatment and storage of metal shredder residue under the permitting provisions of the HCWL with a full reservation of rights.\nOn May 6, 2022, the As filed an action in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda against the BAAQMD as Respondent and the Company as Real Party in Interest (the BAAQMD Case) alleging that the BAAQMD has failed to properly regulate the Companys Oakland shredder facility under the federal and California Clean Air Acts and seeking an order requiring the BAAQMD to revoke the Companys Permit to Operate for the Oakland facility. On June 3, 2022, the BAAQMD removed this action to the United States District Court, Northern District of California where the As had previously filed an action against the Company on July 7, 2021 raising substantially similar issues under the federal Clean Air Acts citizen suit provision alleging violations by the Oakland facility of the federal Clean Air Act and permit conditions and seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, which action is currently in discovery with a trial, if any, currently scheduled for June 2024. The BAAQMD Case was remanded back to Alameda Superior Court on October 7, 2022, and no schedule has yet been established for that case.\nOn March 30, 2022, September 8, 2022, and July 31, 2023, the Company received letters from the COAG alleging violations of the Stipulation for Entry of Final Judgment and Order on Consent (Consent Order) issued by the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Alameda in February 2021 that was entered into with the Alameda County District Attorney, DTSC and COAG to settle certain alleged violations of environmental requirements at our Oakland metals recycling facility. The letters demand that the Company take additional measures to address the off-site release and deposition of light fibrous material (LFM). The Company does not believe that it is in violation of the Consent Order and has detailed the additional control measures that the Company has implemented and continues to implement to reduce the potential for releases of LFM from its Oakland facility. The Company is in continuing discussions with the COAG, the Alameda County District Attorneys office, and DTSC regarding this matter and does not believe that further enforcement action is warranted.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section includes a discussion of our operations for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022. The following discussion and analysis provide information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\nFor discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2021 including comparison to fiscal 2022, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2022.\nBusiness\nFounded in 1906, Radius Recycling is one of North Americas largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. As a vertically integrated organization, we offer a range of products and services to meet global demand through our network that includes 50 retail self-service auto parts stores, 54 metals recycling facilities, and an electric arc furnace (EAF) steel mill. Our internal organizational and reporting structure includes a single operating and reportable segment.\nWe sell recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in both foreign and domestic markets. We also sell a range of finished steel long products produced at our steel mill. Our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and on the supply of raw materials, including end-of-life vehicles, available to be processed at our facilities. Our results of operations also depend substantially on our operating leverage from processing and selling higher volumes of recycled metal as well as our ability to efficiently extract ferrous and nonferrous metals from the shredding process. We respond to changes in selling prices for processed metal by seeking to adjust purchase prices for unprocessed scrap metal in order to manage the impact on our operating results. We believe we generally benefit from sustained periods of stable or rising recycled metal selling prices, which allow us to better maintain or increase both operating results and unprocessed scrap metal flow into our facilities. When recycled metal selling prices decline, either sharply or for a sustained period, our operating margins typically compress. With respect to finished steel products produced at our steel mill, our results of operations are impacted by demand and prices for these products, which are sold to customers located primarily in the Western U.S. and Western Canada.\nOur quarterly operating results fluctuate based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, changes in market conditions for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal and finished steel products, the supply of scrap metal in our domestic markets, and varying demand for used auto parts from our self-service retail stores. Certain of these factors are influenced, to a degree, by the impact of seasonal changes including severe weather conditions, which can impact the timing of shipments and inhibit construction activity utilizing our products, scrap metal collection and production levels at our facilities, and retail admissions and parts sales at our auto parts stores. Further, sanctions, trade actions, and licensing and inspection requirements can impact the level of profitability on sales of our products and, in certain cases, impede or restrict our ability to sell to certain export markets or require us to direct our sales to alternative market destinations, which can cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.\n34 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nStrategic Priorities\nAs we continue to closely monitor economic conditions, we remain focused on the following core strategies and plans to meet our business goals and objectives:\nLong-term expansion of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal supply and processing, sales volumes, and operating margins;\nManufacturing and information technology investments and process improvements to increase the separation and recovery of metal materials from our shredding process, expand product optionality, enable volume growth, increase efficiency, and expand recycling services;\nDevelopment of new products and use of our core competencies in adjacent recycling businesses to expand recycling services and capabilities to reach a broader market, enhance customer value, and increase operating margins;\nIncrease market share through initiatives to maximize volumes and through selective partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions;\nProductivity and continuous improvement initiatives to ensure the safety of our employees, increase operating efficiency and effectiveness, advance sustainable business practices, improve natural resource stewardship, and reduce operating expense;\nUse of our seven deepwater ports and ground-based logistics network to directly access customers domestically and internationally to meet demand for our products wherever it is greatest; and\nFurther optimization of our integrated recycling and steel manufacturing operating platforms to maximize opportunities for synergies, cost efficiencies, and volumes.\nKey economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate\nWe sell recycled metals to the global steel industry for the production of finished steel. Our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the U.S. and Western Canada and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada. Demand for most of our products is cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. The timing and magnitude of the economic cycles in the industries in which our products are used, including global steel manufacturing and nonresidential and infrastructure construction in the U.S., are difficult to predict. Global economic conditions, including impacts of geopolitical instability and the COVID-19 pandemic, structural and cyclical changes in supply and demand conditions, inflation, rising interest rates, and the strength of the U.S. dollar, the availability and price of raw material alternatives, and trade actions such as tariffs affect market prices for and sales volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and steel products in the Western U.S. and Western Canada and can have a significant impact on the results of our operations.\nMarket conditions for recycled metals globally were weaker in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year driven by weaker demand primarily from slower global growth, including due to the impact of prolonged China COVID-19 lockdowns, inflationary pressure including high energy prices and increased scrap collection and other operating costs, rising interest rates, and the strength of the U.S. Dollar. Demand for recycled metals fluctuated throughout fiscal 2023, at times sharply, primarily reflecting the volatility in global steel demand and inventory levels. The slowdown in economic activity that began substantially in the second half of fiscal 2022 and persisted throughout fiscal 2023 led to reduced generation of scrap metal in the U.S. domestic market and increased competition for available scrap volumes. The tight supply flows in combination with the lower price environment for recycled metals put significant pressure on metals spreads in fiscal 2023, causing operating margin compression.\nFor our full 2023 fiscal year, the average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products decreased by 18% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, these average net selling prices increased by 19% and 23%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2023, ferrous sales volumes decreased by 5% and nonferrous sales volumes increased by 7%, compared to the prior fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, sales volumes for these products increased by 5% and 16%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2021. Our ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 reflected a full year, and in fiscal 2022 reflected a partial year, of additional volumes arising from the Columbus Recycling business acquired on October 1, 2021, and the Encore Recycling business acquired on April 29, 2022. Sales volumes for these products in fiscal 2023 reflected a partial year of additional volumes arising from the ScrapSource business acquired on November 18, 2022. As global economies revived and commercial and investment activities resumed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, including throughout fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022, demand for recycled metals and finished steel increased substantially, which contributed to periods of sharp increases in market selling prices for these products. Demand began to weaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which continued into fiscal 2023 amid macroeconomic concerns including slower growth and inflationary pressures. During fiscal 2023, we experienced periods of market recovery, but market conditions for recycled metals, including supply flows, were weaker overall in comparison to fiscal 2022. Average net selling prices for our finished steel products, which are produced in our steel mill using EAF technology, decreased by 13% in fiscal 2023 compared to\n35 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nthe record-high levels reached in the prior fiscal year, but remained at historically high levels, reflecting continued strong market demand for these products.\nWe continue to believe decarbonization efforts by companies, industries, and governments around the world, including investments in low carbon technologies such as renewable energies, electric vehicles, and energy efficiency solutions that are more metal intensive and minimize carbon dioxide emissions from the use of fossil fuels, among other factors, support global long-term demand for our recycled metal products.\nSteel Mill Fire\nOn May 22, 2021, we experienced a fire at our steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the mills melt shop, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. The rolling mill production ceased in early June 2021. In August 2021, our steel mill began ramping up operations following the substantial completion of replacement and repairs of property and equipment in the melt shop that had been lost or damaged by the fire. We experienced loss of business income during the shutdown of the steel mill and the subsequent ramp-up phase which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We have insurance that is fully applicable to the losses and filed insurance claims, which are subject to deductibles and various conditions, exclusions, and limits, for the property that experienced physical loss or damage and business income losses resulting from the matter. The property damage deductible under the policies insuring our assets in this matter is $1 million, while the deductible for lost business income is 10 times the Average Daily Gross Earnings which would have been earned had no interruption occurred, calculated subject to judgments and uncertainties. In fiscal 2021, we recognized an initial $10 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain, the latter reported within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, primarily offsetting applicable losses incurred including capital purchases of $10 million that we had incurred as of the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, we increased the amount of this insurance receivable to $25 million and recognized a related $15 million insurance recovery gain within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses incurred as a result of the fire to date. In addition, during fiscal 2022, we received advance payments from insurers totaling approximately $30 million towards our claims, which amount reduced the $25 million insurance receivable to zero with the remaining amount of advance payments of $5 million reported within other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2022. In fiscal 2023, we received additional cash payments from insurers towards our claims totaling approximately $22 million, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 we reached a full and final settlement with our insurers for our claims and recognized an additional $27 million insurance recovery gain within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire.\nEverett Facility Shredder Fire\nOn December 8, 2021, we experienced a fire at our metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the facilitys shredder building and equipment, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to property reported at other buildings or equipment. As a result of the fire, shredding operations ceased, while all non-shredding operations at the facility continued, including torching, shearing, separating, and sorting purchased non-shreddable recycled ferrous metals. On January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement and repairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. In addition, shredding operations temporarily ceased at the facility on June 18, 2022 and, following discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office, we installed a temporary emission capture system and controls that allowed for us to resume shredding operations on November 11, 2022 and for continued operation during the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continued during this period. The repair and replacement of most property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. We have insurance that we believe is fully applicable to the losses, including but not limited to the costs of installing the temporary capture and controls system and any associated loss of business income, and have filed insurance claims, which are subject to deductibles and various conditions, exclusions, and limits, for the property damage or loss and business income losses resulting from the matter. The property damage deductible under the policies insuring our assets in this matter is $0.5 million, while the deductible for lost business income is 10 times the Average Daily Gross Earnings which would have been earned had no interruption occurred, calculated subject to judgments and uncertainties. The insurance claims resolution process may extend significantly beyond completion of repair and replacement of the physical plant property that experienced physical loss or damage and the restart of production activities. In fiscal 2022, after the fire, we recognized an aggregate $17 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain. In fiscal 2023, we recognized an additional $16 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain. As of August 31, 2023, we had recognized a total of $34 million in insurance recovery gains, all reported within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses to date including impairment charges of $7 million related to the carrying value of plant and equipment assets lost in or damaged by the fire, and capital purchases, non-capitalizable repair and replacement costs, and other applicable losses totaling $27 million that had been incurred as of August 31, 2023. Also, during fiscal 2023 and 2022, we received advance payments from insurers totaling approximately\n36 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\n$26 million and $7 million, respectively, towards our claims, and not reflecting any final or full settlement of claims with the insurers, which amount reduced the insurance receivable to $1 million and $10 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The insurance receivable is reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts do not reflect potential additional recoveries of costs for the repair and replacement of property that experienced physical loss or damage or of business income losses resulting from this matter that may be recognized in the future when settlements of the claims are resolved.\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nFollowing the onset of COVID-19 and its negative effects on our business, most prominently reflected in our fiscal 2020 results, global economic conditions improved beginning in fiscal 2021 and continued to improve through most of fiscal 2022. However, there are ongoing global impacts resulting directly or indirectly from the pandemic, including labor shortages, logistical challenges, and increases in costs for certain goods and services including due to the impact of inflation, which have negatively impacted our sales volumes, operating costs, and financial results to varying degrees.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn this managements discussion and analysis, we use supplemental measures of our performance, liquidity, and capital structure which are derived from our consolidated financial information but which are not presented in our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe that providing these non-GAAP financial measures adds a meaningful presentation of our operating and financial performance, liquidity, and capital structure. We use adjusted EBITDA as one of the measures to compare and evaluate financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is the sum of our net income before results from discontinued operations, interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, goodwill impairment charges, other asset impairment charges, charges for legacy environmental matters (net of recoveries), restructuring charges and other exit-related activities, business development costs not related to ongoing operations including pre-acquisition expenses, charges related to non-ordinary course legal settlements, and other items which are not related to underlying business operational performance. See the reconciliations of supplemental financial measures, including adjusted EBITDA, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Although we find these non-GAAP financial measures useful in evaluating the performance of our business, our reliance on these measures is limited because they often materially differ from our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP. Therefore, we typically use these adjusted amounts in conjunction with our GAAP results to address these limitations. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n37 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nFinancial Highlights of Results of Operations for Fiscal 2023\nDiluted loss per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders in fiscal 2023 was $0.92, compared to earnings per share of $5.72 in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders in fiscal 2023 was $0.85, compared to $6.07 in the prior fiscal year.\nNet loss in fiscal 2023 was $25 million, compared to net income of $172 million in the prior fiscal year.\nAdjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 was $144 million, compared to $313 million in the prior fiscal year.\nMarket conditions for recycled metals were weaker in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year, leading to significantly lower average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products and a compression in metal spreads. The average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products decreased by 18% and 11%, respectively, compared to fiscal 2022. Ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes decreased by 5% and increased by 7%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year, which changes included additional volumes arising from our three business acquisitions completed during fiscal 2022 and 2023, as well as the adverse impact on sales volumes in the prior fiscal year of the initial Everett shredder downtime. Our ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 were adversely impacted by disruptions related to an extended shredder outage at the Everett facility and a regulatory issue limiting operations at our shredder facility in California, both of which were resolved by mid-November 2022. Our nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 reflected additional recovery of recycled material through our advanced metal recovery technology investments. Average net selling prices for our finished steel products decreased by 13% compared to the record-high prices in the prior fiscal year, contributing to lower metal spreads. Finished steel sales volumes increased by 12% in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting the impact on the prior fiscal year volumes of the ramp up of steel mill operations which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022 following the May 2021 steel mill fire. Our results in fiscal 2023 also reflected the unfavorable impact of tighter supply flows of scrap metal and reduced processed volumes in the lower price and slower economic environment, significantly lower year-over-year platinum group metals (PGM) prices, and inflationary pressure on operating costs, as well as a favorable change in the effect of average inventory accounting year-over-year. In addition, our results in fiscal 2023 included $51 million in goodwill and other asset impairment charges and $43 million in insurance recovery gains relating to the steel mill fire and the Everett facility shredder fire. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we achieved the full quarterly run rate of $10 million of productivity initiatives announced in October 2022 and the full quarterly run rate of $5 million of selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) savings initiatives announced in January 2023, which helped to offset the effects of higher operating costs including from inflationary pressure.\nSG&A expense in fiscal 2023 was relatively flat compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals due to Company performance, partially offset by higher salaries and wages and outside and professional services expenses, due in part to our acquisitions and other growth-related initiatives, as well as higher legacy environmental charges and the impact of inflation. These higher expenses in fiscal 2023 were partially offset by benefits from productivity and cost reduction initiatives when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nThe following items further highlight selected liquidity and capital structure metrics:\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $139 million in fiscal 2023, compared to $238 million in the prior fiscal year.\nDebt was $249 million as of both August 31, 2022 and 2023.\nDebt, net of cash, was $243 million as of August 31, 2023, compared to $205 million as of August 31, 2022.\nSee the reconciliations of adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders, adjusted EBITDA, and debt, net of cash in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.\n38 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nResults of Operations\nSelected Financial Measures and Operating Statistics\nFor the Year Ended August 31,\n% Increase (Decrease)\n($ in thousands, except for prices and per share amounts)\n2023 vs. 2022\n2022 vs. 2021\nFerrous revenues\n$\n1,439,983\n$\n1,914,255\n$\n1,557,891\n(25\n)%\n%\nNonferrous revenues\n781,102\n892,444\n684,862\n(12\n)%\n%\nSteel revenues(1)\n507,550\n531,731\n379,203\n(5\n)%\n%\nRetail and other revenues\n153,589\n147,385\n136,595\n%\n%\nTotal revenues\n2,882,224\n3,485,815\n2,758,551\n(17\n)%\n%\nCost of goods sold\n2,574,513\n2,997,745\n2,305,357\n(14\n)%\n%\nGross margin (total revenues less cost of goods sold)\n$\n307,711\n$\n488,070\n$\n453,194\n(37\n)%\n%\nGross margin (%)\n10.7\n%\n14.0\n%\n16.4\n%\n(24\n)%\n(15\n)%\nSelling, general and administrative expense\n$\n265,929\n$\n263,257\n$\n242,463\n%\n%\nDiluted (loss) earnings per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders:\nReported\n$\n(0.92\n)\n$\n5.72\n$\n5.66\nNM\n%\nAdjusted(2)\n$\n0.85\n$\n6.07\n$\n6.13\n(86\n)%\n(1\n)%\nNet (loss) income\n$\n(25,438\n)\n$\n171,996\n$\n169,975\nNM\n%\nAdjusted EBITDA(2)\n$\n144,327\n$\n312,715\n$\n289,209\n(54\n)%\n%\nRecycled ferrous metal average sales prices ($/LT)(3):\nDomestic\n$\n$\n$\n(18\n)%\n%\nForeign\n$\n$\n$\n(18\n)%\n%\nAverage\n$\n$\n$\n(18\n)%\n%\nFerrous volumes (LT, in thousands):\nDomestic(4)\n1,952\n1,806\n1,500\n%\n%\nForeign\n2,424\n2,810\n2,908\n(14\n)%\n(3\n)%\nTotal ferrous volumes (LT, in thousands)(4)(5)\n4,376\n4,616\n4,408\n(5\n)%\n%\nRecycled nonferrous metal average sales price ($/pound)(3)(6)\n$\n0.96\n$\n1.08\n$\n0.88\n(11\n)%\n%\nNonferrous volumes (pounds, in thousands)(4)(6)\n738,937\n687,419\n593,378\n%\n%\nFinished steel average sales price ($/ST)(3)\n$\n$\n1,075\n$\n(13\n)%\n%\nFinished steel sales volumes (ST, in thousands)\n%\n(5\n)%\nCars purchased (in thousands)(7)\n(8\n)%\n(8\n)%\nNumber of auto parts stores at period end\n(2\n)%\n%\nRolling mill utilization(8)\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nNM = Not Meaningful\nLT = Long Ton, which is equivalent to 2,240 pounds.

In fiscal 2023, the average net selling prices for our ferrous and nonferrous products decreased by 18% and 11%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. Ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes decreased by 5% and increased by 7%, respectively, compared to the prior fiscal year. Our ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 in part reflected additional volumes arising from the Columbus Recycling business acquired on October 1, 2021, the Encore Recycling business acquired on April 29, 2022, and the ScrapSource business acquired on November 18, 2022, as well as the adverse impact on sales volumes in the prior fiscal year of the initial Everett shredder downtime. Our ferrous and nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 were adversely impacted by disruptions related to an extended shredder outage at the Everett facility and a regulatory issue limiting operations at our shredder facility in California, both of which were resolved by mid-November 2022, as well as tight supply flows in the lower price and slower economic environment. Our nonferrous sales volumes in fiscal 2023 reflected additional recovery of recycled material through our advanced metal recovery technology investments. Market conditions for our finished steel products were softer in fiscal 2023, leading to finished steel average selling prices decreasing 13%, compared to the record-high prices in the prior fiscal year. Finished steel sales volumes increased 12% in fiscal 2023, primarily reflecting the impact on the prior fiscal year volumes of the ramp up of steel mill operations that began in August 2021 and which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The ramp-up of steel mill operations during the first half of fiscal 2022 followed completion of repair and replacement of damaged property arising from the May 2021 steel mill fire.\nOperating Performance\nNet loss in fiscal 2023 was $25 million, compared to net income of $172 million in the prior fiscal year. Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 was $144 million, compared to $313 million in the prior fiscal year. The lower price environment for recycled metals, as well as the impact of tighter supply flows, reduced processed volumes, and the extended operational disruptions in the first quarter of fiscal 2023, had a significant adverse impact on our operating margins and overall operating results in fiscal 2023. Ferrous metal spreads in fiscal 2023 decreased by approximately 21% compared to the prior fiscal year driven by lower selling prices and the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles in the tighter supply environment. In addition, average net selling prices for our nonferrous joint products that are recovered from the shredding process, comprising primarily zorba, decreased by approximately 3% compared to the prior fiscal year. Finished steel metal spreads were also lower in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior fiscal year. Our results in fiscal 2023 also reflected the unfavorable impact of tighter supply flows of scrap metal and reduced processed volumes in the lower price and slower economic environment, significantly lower year-over-year PGM prices, and inflationary pressure on operating costs, as well as a favorable change in the effect of average inventory accounting year-over-year. In addition, our results in fiscal 2023 included $51 million in goodwill and other asset impairment charges and $43 million in insurance recovery gains relating to the steel mill fire and the Everett facility shredder fire. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we achieved the full quarterly run rate of $10 million of productivity initiatives announced in October 2022 and the full quarterly run rate of $5 million of selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) savings initiatives announced in January 2023, which helped to offset the effects of higher operating costs including from inflationary pressure.\nSG&A expense in fiscal 2023 was relatively flat compared to the prior fiscal year reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals due to Company performance, partially offset by higher salaries and wages and outside and professional services expenses, due in part to our acquisitions and other growth-related initiatives, as well as higher legacy environmental charges and the impact of inflation. These higher expenses in fiscal 2023 were partially offset by benefits from productivity and cost reduction initiatives when compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIn October 2022, we announced and began implementing productivity and cost reduction initiatives with a targeted annual benefit of approximately $40 million. In addition, in January 2023, we announced incremental initiatives aiming to reduce SG&A costs by approximately $20 million annually. These initiatives aim to improve profitability through a combination of increased yields, efficiencies in processing, procurement, and pricing, and reduced costs including from headcount reductions, decreased lease costs, professional and outside services, and implementation of operational efficiencies. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we achieved the full quarterly run rate of benefits from these initiatives, and others implemented during fiscal 2022, which helped to partially offset the effects of inflationary pressure on operating costs.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2023, which resulted in a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $39 million, representing a portion of the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to one reporting unit comprising a regional metals recycling operation, while the goodwill allocated to our other reporting units was deemed to not be impaired. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2022. See further discussion in the Critical Accounting Estimates section at the end of Part II, Item of this report.\n40 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nSee the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $19 million, $9 million, and $5 million as of August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher interest rates on amounts outstanding under our bank credit facilities, as well as increased average borrowings, compared to the prior fiscal year.\nIncome Taxes\nYear Ended August 31,\n(Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes\n$\n(28,076\n)\n$\n216,676\n$\n207,989\nIncome tax benefit (expense)\n$\n2,747\n$\n(44,597\n)\n$\n(37,935\n)\nEffective tax rate\n9.8\n%\n20.6\n%\n18.2\n%\nOur effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was a benefit on pre-tax loss of 9.8%, compared to an expense on pre-tax income of 20.6% for fiscal 2022. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the aggregate effect of the relatively low absolute level of pre-tax earnings, permanent differences from non-deductible expenses, and unrecognized tax benefits. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2022 approximated the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, reflecting tax benefits from vesting of share-based awards, the foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction, and research and development credits, offset by the aggregate impact of state taxes and permanent differences from non-deductible expenses.\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior fiscal year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. We continue to maintain valuation allowances against certain deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions as a result of negative evidence, including historical losses in these jurisdictions, which indicates that it is more-likely-than-not that the associated tax benefit will not be realized. Realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the associated tax jurisdictions in future years to benefit from the reversal of net deductible temporary differences. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets. Changes in historical earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause us to adjust our valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which would impact our results of operations in the period we determine that these factors have changed.\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, with tax provisions primarily focused on implementing a 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) and a 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases. As of August 31, 2023, we did not meet the threshold to be subject to the CAMT. We may, however, be subject to the 1% excise tax on future share repurchases.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe rely on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity, supplemented by current cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe had cash balances of $6 million and $44 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Cash balances are intended to be used primarily for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions. We use excess cash on hand to reduce amounts outstanding under our credit facilities. As of both August 31, 2023 and 2022, debt was $249 million, and debt, net of cash, was $243 million as of August 31, 2023, compared to $205 million as of August 31, 2022, which increase was primarily due to lower cash balances resulting from the repayment of increased borrowings from our credit facilities during fiscal 2023 to fund the acquisition of the ScrapSource business on November 18, 2022, and capital expenditures. See the reconciliation of debt, net of cash, in Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7.\n41 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2023 was $139 million, compared to $238 million in fiscal 2022.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2023 included a $48 million decrease in inventories primarily due to lower raw material purchase costs and the timing of purchases and sales and a $12 million decrease in accounts receivable primarily due to the timing of sales and collections. Uses of cash in fiscal 2023 included a $24 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to decreased incentive compensation liabilities and a $14 million decrease in accrued liabilities due in part to recognition through fiscal 2023 earnings of advance payments received from insurers in excess of recoveries as of the end of fiscal 2022 upon full and final settlement with our insurers for our claims arising from the May 2021 steel mill fire.\nSources of cash other than from earnings in fiscal 2022 included a $21 million increase in accounts payable primarily due to higher raw material purchase prices and the timing of purchases and payments. Uses of cash in fiscal 2022 included a $37 million increase in inventories due to higher raw material purchase costs and the timing of purchases and sales, a $19 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to increased receivables from insurers, a $15 million decrease in environmental liabilities primarily due to payments in connection with legacy environmental matters, and a $14 million decrease in accrued payroll and related liabilities primarily due to decreased incentive compensation liabilities. The sources and uses of cash related to operating activities described above also reflect higher net working capital needs during the ramp-up of steel mill operations that began in August 2021 following completion of repair and replacement of damaged property arising from the May 2021 steel mill fire.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 was $144 million, compared to $316 million in fiscal 2022.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 included $25 million paid to acquire the assets of the ScrapSource business on November 18, 2022. We funded this acquisition using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. See Note 7 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2023 also included capital expenditures of $130 million to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for investments in advanced metals recovery technology and environmental and safety-related assets, compared to $150 million in the prior fiscal year. Cash flows from investing activities in fiscal 2023 included proceeds of $8 million representing the portion of advance payments from insurers deemed a recovery of capital purchases incurred for repair and replacement of damaged property arising from the December 2021 Everett facility shredder fire, compared to such proceeds totaling $17 million in the prior fiscal year in connection with our insurance claims relating to the May 2021 steel mill fire and the December 2021 Everett facility shredder fire.\nCash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 included $117 million paid to acquire the Columbus Recycling business on October 1, 2021, which amount included $10 million paid primarily for net working capital in excess of an agreed-upon benchmark, and also included $63 million paid to acquire the Encore Recycling business on April 29, 2022, which amount included $8 million paid at closing for estimated net working capital in excess of an agreed-upon benchmark. We funded these acquisitions using cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. Cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 also included the purchase of an investment in the equity of a privately-held Canadian recycling entity for $5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2023 was $33 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $95 million in fiscal 2022.\nCash flows from financing activities in fiscal 2023 included $3 million in net repayment of debt, compared to $166 million in net borrowings of debt in the prior fiscal year (refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures at the end of this Item 7). Uses of cash in fiscal 2023 and 2022 included $8 million and $11 million, respectively, for payment of employee tax withholdings resulting from settlement of share-based awards and $21 million in each fiscal year for the payment of dividends.\n42 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nDebt\nFollowing is a summary of our outstanding balances and availability on credit facilities and long-term debt, exclusive of finance lease obligations (in thousands):\nOutstanding as of\nAugust 31, 2023\nRemaining\nAvailability\nBank secured revolving credit facilities(1)\n$\n230,000\n$\n573,472\nOther debt obligations\n$\n12,192\nN/A\n(1)Remaining availability is net of $8 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit as of August 31, 2023.\nOur senior secured revolving credit facilities, which provide for revolving loans of $800 million and C$15 million, mature in August 2027 pursuant to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and other lenders party thereto. Interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement are based, at our option, on either the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (or the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate, CDOR for C$ loans), plus a spread of between 1.25% and 2.00%, with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA (as defined by the credit agreement), or the greater of (a) the prime rate, (b) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (c) the daily rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a spread of between 0.25% and 1.00% based on a pricing grid tied to our consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA ratio. In addition, commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facilities at rates between 0.175% and 0.30% based on a pricing grid tied to our ratio of consolidated net funded debt to EBITDA.\nUnder the credit agreement, we may establish one or more key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our performance with respect to certain of our environmental, social and governance targets. Subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement, we may propose to amend the credit agreement to modify (i) the pricing spread and (ii) the commitment fee rate. Such modifications would be tied to our performance against the KPIs and would allow for (i) the pricing spread to be increased or decreased by no more than (a) 0.025% per KPI and (b) 0.05% for all KPIs, and (ii) the commitment fee rate to be increased or decreased by no more than 0.005% for all KPIs. Such adjustments would be determined on an annual basis and would not be cumulative.\nWe had borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities of $230 million as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022. The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our credit facilities was 7.17% and 3.65% as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered three interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variability in interest cash flows associated with our variable-rate loans under our credit facilities. The interest rate swaps require us to make fixed-rate payments based on a total notional amount of $150 million and an average annual rate of approximately 4.40% in exchange for the receipt of variable-rate amounts over a three-year term ending in August 2026. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nWe use the credit facilities to fund working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions. Our credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) our ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of our business, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions. As of August 31, 2023, the financial covenants under the credit agreement included (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges, and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness.\nAs of August 31, 2023, we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit agreement. The consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio was required to be no less than 1.50 to 1.00 and was 3.08 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2023. The consolidated leverage ratio was required to be no more than 0.55 to 1.00 and was 0.22 to 1.00 as of August 31, 2023.\nOur obligations under our credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of our subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of our and our subsidiaries assets, including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.\nWhile we currently expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit agreement, we may not be able to do so in the event market conditions or other factors have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position. If we do not maintain compliance with our financial covenants and are unable to obtain an amendment or waiver from our lenders, a breach of a financial covenant would constitute an event of default and allow the lenders to exercise remedies under the agreements, the\n43 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nmost severe of which is the termination of the credit facility under our committed bank credit agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed under the agreement. In such case, we would be required to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain alternative funds. We cannot assure that any such alternative funds, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nOther debt obligations, which totaled $12 million and $13 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligations are treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and achieves specified minimum operating metrics, with payments continuing for a period of four years thereafter.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures totaled $130 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $150 million for fiscal 2022. Capital expenditures included approximately $33 million and $51 million for investments in growth in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. We currently plan to invest approximately $100 million in capital expenditures in fiscal 2024. These capital expenditures include investments in growth, including new nonferrous processing technologies, and to support volume initiatives as well as post-acquisition and other growth projects, and investments to upgrade our equipment and infrastructure and for environmental and safety-related assets, using cash generated from operations and available credit facilities. Supply chain disruptions have contributed to some delays in construction activities and equipment deliveries related to our capital projects, and to the time required to obtain permits from government agencies, resulting in the deferral of certain capital expenditures. Given the continually evolving nature of such disruptions and other factors impacting the timing of project completion, the extent to which forecasted capital expenditures could be deferred is uncertain.\nEnvironmental Compliance\nBuilding on our commitment to recycling and operating our business in an environmentally responsible manner, we continue to invest in facilities that improve our environmental presence in the communities in which we operate. As part of our capital expenditures discussed in the prior paragraph, we invested approximately $33 million in capital expenditures for environmental projects in fiscal 2023, and we currently plan to invest approximately $35 million for such projects in fiscal 2024. These projects include investments in equipment to ensure ongoing compliance with air quality and other environmental regulations and storm water systems.\nWe have been identified by the EPA as one of the potentially responsible parties that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to Portland Harbor. See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for a discussion of this matter, as well as other legacy environmental loss contingencies. We believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely to or which it is reasonably possible that we will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We have insurance policies and Qualified Settlement Funds (QSFs) that we believe will provide reimbursement for costs we incur for defense, remediation, and mitigation for natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor, although there are no assurances that those policies and the QSFs will cover all of the costs which we may incur. Significant cash outflows in the future related to Portland Harbor could reduce the amounts available for borrowing that could otherwise be used for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments, and acquisitions and could result in our failure to maintain compliance with certain covenants in our debt agreements, and could adversely impact our liquidity.\nDividends\nOn June 27, 2023, our Board of Directors declared a dividend for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 of $0.1875 per common share, which equates to an annual cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. Dividends of $0.75 per common share, totaling $21 million, were declared and paid during fiscal 2023, and $21 million in dividends were also declared and paid during fiscal 2022.\nShare Repurchase Program\nWe did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal 2023. For information regarding share repurchases during fiscal 2022, see Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities above in Part II of this report, incorporated by reference herein.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nHistorically, our available cash resources, internally generated funds, credit facilities, and equity offerings have financed our acquisitions, capital expenditures, working capital, and other financing needs.\n44 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nWe generally believe our current cash resources, internally generated funds, existing credit facilities, and access to the capital markets will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity needs for working capital, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, investments and acquisitions, joint ventures, debt service requirements, environmental obligations, and other contingencies. However, in the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need additional liquidity which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds. There can be no assurances that any such supplemental funding, if sought, could be obtained or, if obtained, would be adequate or on acceptable terms.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain contractual obligations to make future payments. The following table summarizes future obligations related to debt and leases as of August 31, 2023 (in thousands):\nPayment Due by Period\nThereafter\nTotals\nContractual Obligations\nCredit facilities(1)\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n230,000\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n230,000\nInterest payments on credit facilities(2)\n$\n16,491\n$\n16,491\n$\n16,491\n$\n16,084\n$\n-\n$\n-\n$\n65,557\nOther debt, including interest(3)\n$\n3,924\n$\n2,799\n$\n2,799\n$\n2,799\n$\n$\n$\n13,259\nFinance leases, including interest\n$\n2,558\n$\n1,746\n$\n1,262\n$\n1,103\n$\n$\n$\n8,053\nOperating leases(4)\n$\n23,768\n$\n19,391\n$\n15,503\n$\n13,546\n$\n10,901\n$\n55,434\n$\n138,543\n(1)Credit facilities include the principal amount of borrowings outstanding under bank secured revolving credit facilities, which mature in August 2027.\n(2)Interest payments on credit facilities are based on interest rates in effect as of August 31, 2023. As contractual interest rates and the amount of debt outstanding is variable in certain cases, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided.\n(3)Other debt obligations primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligation is treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and continue for a period of four years thereafter.\n(4)Operating lease payments reflect those embedded in the measurement of our operating lease liabilities and, thus, include future lease payments for the remaining non-cancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which we are reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise). These operating lease payments do not include certain tax, insurance, and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year. Also, we have excluded future minimum lease payments for leases that have been executed but have not commenced as of August 31, 2023.\nIn addition to future obligations related to debt and leases presented in the table above, we have certain material cash requirements, including but not limited to commitments for capital expenditures. See Capital Expenditures within Liquidity and Capital Resources above in this Item 7 for discussion of our planned investment in capital expenditures in fiscal 2024, a portion of which represents contractual commitments that existed as of the end of our fiscal 2023. We also had open purchase orders as of August 31, 2023 for purchases of primarily fuels and lubricants, machinery and equipment components and parts, and consumables used in our operations of approximately $76 million, nearly all of which require payment of cash in our fiscal 2024.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we entered three interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variability in interest cash flows associated with our variable-rate loans under our credit facilities. The interest rate swaps require us to make fixed-rate payments based on a total notional amount of $150 million and an average annual rate of approximately 4.40% in exchange for the receipt of variable-rate amounts over a three-year term ending in August 2026. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nSee Note 13 - Employee Benefits in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure related to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans, which include a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement benefit plan, multiemployer pension plans, defined contribution plans, and a deferred compensation plan.\nWe maintain stand-by letters of credit to provide support for certain obligations, including workers compensation and performance bonds. As of August 31, 2023, we had $8 million outstanding under these arrangements.\n45 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires us to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. An accounting estimate is deemed to be critical if it is made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use. We are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.\nOur critical accounting estimates include those related to inventories, business acquisitions, long-lived assets, goodwill, environmental costs, and income taxes.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. We consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of our inventory. As we generally sell our recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, we utilize the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.\nThe accounting process we use to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, we rely on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Companys estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of our scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, we further adjust our ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component).\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment and determine that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, we are then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. We also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, we apply a one-step quantitative test and record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWe estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for the reporting unit. To estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year in the discounted cash flow analysis, we employ a terminal value technique, whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures, adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the analysis, and then discount these estimated cash flows by the WACC to establish the terminal value.\n46 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nThe determination of fair value using the income approach requires judgment and involves the use of estimates and assumptions about expected future cash flows derived from internal forecasts and the impact of market conditions on those assumptions. Assumptions primarily include revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants.\nWe also use a market approach based on earnings multiple data and our Companys market capitalization to corroborate our reporting units valuations. We reconcile the Companys market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2023. As of the testing date, the balance of our goodwill was $269 million, which was allocated among four reporting units. All of the approximately $13 million of goodwill carried by one of the reporting units, a recycling services operation, related to the business acquisition that was completed in fiscal 2023. We elected to perform the qualitative assessment for this reporting unit and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. The remaining $256 million of goodwill as of the testing date was allocated among three reporting units, which consist of two regional metals recycling operations and our network of auto parts stores. Based primarily on the respective financial and operational performance of each of these three reporting units and the Company overall, as well as the year-over-year decrease in our market capitalization as of the testing date, we elected to not perform the qualitative assessment and to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test for goodwill allocated to the three reporting units to identify potential impairment and measure an impairment loss, if necessary.\nThe three reporting units for which we performed the quantitative assessment consist of two regional metals recycling operations and our network of auto parts stores. For one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 24% and 33%, respectively, as of July 1, 2023. For the other metals recycling reporting unit, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a partial impairment of goodwill of $39 million. The projections used in the income approach for the metals recycling and autos reporting units took into consideration, as applicable, the impact of recent and current market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metals and retail auto parts, the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, and recent trends in production and other operating costs. The projections assumed a recovery of operating margins from the levels experienced around the time of the July 1, 2023 measurement date over a multi-year period. The WACC rate used in the income approach valuation for the two metals recycling reporting units was 13.68%, and the WACC rate used for the autos reporting unit was 13.62%. The terminal growth rate used in the income approach valuation for all three reporting units was 2%. A reporting-unit-specific risk premium is embedded in the WACC to reflect the perceived level of uncertainty inherent in each reporting unit's expected future cash flows. For the metals recycling and autos reporting units with no goodwill impairment, assuming all other components of the fair value estimates were held constant, an increase in the WACC of 100 basis points would have decreased the indicated headroom to 13% and 21%, respectively. For the metals recycling reporting unit with partial goodwill impairment, assuming all other components of the fair value estimate were held constant, an increase in the WACC of 100 basis points would have resulted in a material amount of additional impairment of the goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further detail.\nAs a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming the estimates described above, actual results could differ from those estimates. Future events and changing market conditions may impact our assumptions as to future revenue and operating margin growth, WACC, and other factors that may result in changes in our estimates of the reporting units fair value. Although we believe the assumptions used in testing our reporting units goodwill for impairment are reasonable, a lack of recovery or further deterioration in market conditions for recycled metals from current levels, a sustained trend of weaker than anticipated financial performance for the reporting units with allocated goodwill, including the pace and extent of operating margin and volume recovery, a lack of recovery or further decline in our share price from current levels for a sustained period, or an increase in the market-based WACC, among other factors, could significantly impact our impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that, if incurred, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nWe recognize the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Contingent purchase consideration is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Within one year from the date of acquisition, we may update the value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and the resulting goodwill balance, based on information\n47 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nreceived regarding the valuation of such assets and liabilities that was not available at the time of purchase. Measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third-party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired. See Note 7 - Business Acquisitions in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report for disclosure of our acquisition of the Columbus Recycling business on October 1, 2021, our acquisition of the Encore Recycling business on April 29, 2022, and our acquisition of the ScrapSource business on November 18, 2022.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe test long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. We test our asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group. Determination of fair value is considered a critical accounting estimate. In fiscal 2023, we did not identify any triggering events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of a material asset group may be impaired.\nEnvironmental Costs\nWe operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks. To manage these risks, we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants. Environmental management and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks. We estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The regulatory and government management of these projects is complex, which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. If further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these liabilities, the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated. Adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which accruals are established are made. The factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include:\nCurrent regulations, both at the time the liability is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process, which specify standards for acceptable remediation;\nInformation about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated;\nThe professional judgment of senior level internal staff and outside consultants, who take into account similar, recent instances of environmental remediation issues, and studies of our sites, among other considerations;\nAvailable technologies that can be used for remediation; and\nThe number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation.\nOur accrued environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2023 included $5 million related to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. Because the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a final determination of the amount of natural resource damages or of the allocation among the potentially responsible parties of costs of the investigations, or remedial action costs, we believe it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which we are likely or which it is reasonably possible that we may incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Therefore, no additional amounts have been accrued. Further, we have been notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party at sites other than Portland Harbor which are currently or formerly owned or operated by us or at other sites where we may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities. See Contingencies - Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this report.\n48 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nIncome Taxes\nValuation Allowances\nWe assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. We consider all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. Due to the significant judgment involved, realizability of our deferred tax assets is considered a critical accounting estimate.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to commodity price risk, mainly associated with variations in the market price for ferrous and nonferrous metals, including recycled metal, finished steel products, auto bodies, and other commodities. The timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions. We respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices. We actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense. Sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers, and generally orders are placed 30 to 60 days ahead of the shipment date. However, financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations. We assess the net realizable value of inventory (NRV) each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimates of future selling prices. For our uncommitted inventories, a 10% decrease in the selling price of inventory would not have had a material NRV impact as of August 31, 2023 and 2022.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations. Our revolving credit facility is subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates. We may at times use derivative instruments to manage some portion of this risk. Our interest rate swap derivatives are agreements with independent counterparties that provide for payments based on a notional amount and are designed to hedge the variability in cash flows resulting from variable interest rates for a portion of our credit facilities. If market interest rates had changed 10% from actual interest rate levels in fiscal 2023 or 2022, the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non-performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of recycled metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations, or to provide sufficient quantities of recycled metal or payment to settle advances, loans and other contractual receivables in connection with demolition and scrap extraction projects. We manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods, including shipping recycled ferrous metal exports under letters of credit, collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers, establishment of credit limits for certain sales on open terms, credit insurance and designation of collateral and financial guarantees securing advances, loans, and other contractual receivables. We have experienced fluctuations in the availability of credit insurance that we have historically used to cover a portion of our recycled metal and finished steel sales to domestic customers, which in cases of reduced availability may increase our exposure to customer credit risk. In addition, in higher or rising commodity price environments, we have experienced proportionately lower credit insurance coverage of applicable customer credit limits, which may increase our exposure to customer credit risk.\nHistorically, we have shipped almost all of our large shipments of recycled ferrous metal to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks deemed creditworthy. The letters of credit ensure payment by the customer. As we generally sell export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, our customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices, as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship. However, in periods of significantly declining prices, or due to country-specific currency limitations, our customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped.\nAs of August 31, 2023 and 2022, 38% and 24%, respectively, of our accounts receivable balance were covered by letters of credit, and the amount of past due receivables was not material.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk, mainly associated with sales transactions and related accounts receivable denominated in the U.S. Dollar by our Canadian subsidiary with a functional currency of the Canadian Dollar. In certain instances, we may use derivatives to manage some portion of this risk. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, we did not have any derivative contracts to manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n52 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Companys internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that relate to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of the Companys management and directors; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting using the criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on its assessment, management determined that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was effective as of August 31, 2023. As permitted by SEC guidance for newly acquired businesses, management's assessment of the Company's internal control over financial reporting did not include an assessment of internal control over financial reporting of the ScrapSource business acquired by the Company on November 18, 2022. The ScrapSource business represented less than 2% of consolidated total assets and less than 1% of consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended August 31, 2023.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Companys consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, also audited the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, as stated in their report included herein.\nTamara L. Lundgren\nStefano R. Gaggini\nChairman, President and Chief Executive Officer\nSenior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOctober 25, 2023\nOctober 25, 2023\n53 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive (loss) income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August 31, 2023 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Companys consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded the ScrapSource business from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of August 31, 2023 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during fiscal 2023. We have also excluded the ScrapSource business from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. The ScrapSource business is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total revenues excluded from managements assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent approximately 2% and 1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended August 31, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\n54 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - One of the Metals Recycling Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 2 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, management evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Management may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The quantitative impairment test entails estimating the fair value of each reporting unit with allocated goodwill and comparing it to the reporting units carrying amount. Management records the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, if any, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Management estimated the fair value of the reporting units subject to the quantitative impairment test as of July 1, 2023 using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value under this income approach involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general, and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. For one of the metals recycling reporting units subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a partial impairment of goodwill of $39 million in the year ended August 31, 2023. The Companys goodwill balance was $229 million as of August 31, 2023, which includes goodwill related to one of the metals recycling reporting units subject to a quantitative impairment test as of July 1, 2023.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of one of the metals recycling reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating managements significant assumptions related to the future ferrous commodity price expectations and the WACC; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to managements goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the reporting units subject to the quantitative impairment test. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing managements process for developing the fair value estimate of one of the metals recycling reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach; and (iv) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to the future ferrous commodity price expectations and the WACC. Evaluating managements assumption related to the future ferrous commodity price expectations involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of one of the metals recycling reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the income approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the WACC assumption.\n55 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nVolume of Ferrous Metal Inventory\nAs described in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Companys processed and unprocessed scrap metal inventory was $144 million as of August 31, 2023, of which processed and unprocessed ferrous metal inventory represents a significant portion. The accounting process the Company uses to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, management relies on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Companys estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, management periodically reviews shrink factors and performs monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of the Companys scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, the Company further adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the volume of ferrous metal inventory is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the ferrous metal inventory volumes.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the ferrous metal inventory volumes, including the ferrous metal recoveries and yields. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing inventory quantities received; (ii) assessing the reasonableness of managements estimated yields by comparing them to actual yields of ultimate ferrous metal recoveries; (iii) testing ferrous metal inventory shipments; (iv) observing certain of managements physical inventory counts; (v) assessing rollforward activity between the time of the inventory counts observed and year-end; and (vi) considering whether evidence obtained in other areas of the audit is consistent with managements estimates related to ferrous metal inventory volumes.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPortland, Oregon\nOctober 25, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1976, which includes periods before the Company became subject to SEC reporting requirements.\n56 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except per share amounts)\n(Currency -

Nature of Operations\nFounded in 1906, Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling, an Oregon corporation, is one of North Americas largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous metal, including end-of-life vehicles, and a manufacturer of finished steel products. Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling and its consolidated subsidiaries, together, are referred to as the Company.\nThe Company acquires and recycles ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal for sale to foreign and domestic metal producers, processors, and brokers, and it procures salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through a network of self-service auto parts stores. Most of these auto parts stores supply the Companys shredding facilities with auto bodies that are processed into saleable recycled metal products. In addition to the sale of recycled metal products processed at its facilities, the Company provides a variety of recycling and related services. The Company also produces a range of finished steel long products at its electric arc furnace (EAF) steel mill using recycled ferrous metal sourced internally from its recycling and joint venture operations and other raw materials.\nAs of August 31, 2023, all of the Companys facilities were located in the United States (U.S.) and its territories and Canada.\nNote 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling and its majority-owned and wholly-owned subsidiaries. The equity method of accounting is used for investments in joint ventures over which the Company has significant influence but does not have effective control. All significant intercompany account balances, transactions, profits, and losses have been eliminated. All transactions and relationships with variable interest entities are evaluated to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the entities, therefore requiring consolidation. The Company does not have any variable interest entities requiring consolidation.\nSegment Reporting\nThe accounting standards for reporting information about operating segments define an operating segment as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses for which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Companys internal organizational and reporting structure reflects a functionally based, integrated model and includes a single operating and reportable segment.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include short-term securities that are not restricted by third parties and have an original maturity date of 90 days or less. Included in accounts payable are book overdrafts representing outstanding payments in excess of funds on deposit of $62 million and $56 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable represent amounts primarily due from customers on product and other sales. These accounts receivable, which are reduced by an allowance for credit losses, are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The Company extends credit to customers under contracts containing customary and explicit payment terms, and payment is generally required within 30 to 60 days of shipment. Nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment. Historically, almost all of the Companys ferrous export sales have been made with letters of credit. Ferrous and nonferrous metal sales to domestic customers and finished steel sales are generally made on open account, and a portion of these sales are covered by credit insurance.\nThe Company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors, including whether sales were made pursuant to letters of credit or required deposits prior to shipment, the aging of customer receivable balances, the financial condition of the Companys customers, historical collection rates, and economic trends. Management uses this evaluation to estimate the amount of customer receivables that may not be collected in the future and records a provision for expected credit losses. Accounts are written off when all efforts to collect have been exhausted. The allowance for credit losses was $2 million as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022.\nAlso included in accounts receivable are short-term advances to scrap metal suppliers used as a mechanism to acquire unprocessed scrap metal. The advances are generally repaid with scrap metal, as opposed to cash. Repayments of advances with scrap metal are treated as\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nnoncash operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and totaled $13 million, $11 million, and $10 million for the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nInventories\nThe Companys inventories consist of processed and unprocessed scrap metal (ferrous, nonferrous, and mixed nonferrous recovered joint products arising from the manufacturing process), semi-finished steel products (billets), finished steel products (primarily rebar, wire rod, and merchant bar), used and salvaged vehicles, and supplies. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The Company determines the cost of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal inventories using the average cost method and capitalizes substantially all direct processing costs and facility costs into inventory. The Company allocates material and production costs to joint products using the gross margin method. The Company determines the cost of used and salvaged vehicle inventory at its auto parts stores, which is reported within finished goods, based on the average price the Company pays for a vehicle and capitalizes the vehicle cost and substantially all production costs into inventory. The Company determines the cost of its semi-finished and finished steel product inventories based on average costs and capitalizes all direct and indirect costs of manufacturing into inventory. Indirect costs of manufacturing include general plant costs, maintenance, and facility costs. The Company determines the cost of the substantial majority of its supplies inventory using the average cost method and reduces the carrying value for losses due to obsolescence. Fixed manufacturing costs incurred in periods of abnormally low production are expensed. The Company considers estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value of its inventory. As the Company generally sells its recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price is agreed, it utilizes the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated net realizable value of quantities on hand that will be shipped under these contracts and sales orders.\nThe accounting process the Company uses to record ferrous scrap metal quantities relies on significant estimates. With respect to estimating the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal inventory that are moved into production, management relies on weighed quantities of the processed ferrous material, adjusted for estimated metal recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and other judgments by management. Actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality, moisture content, and the source of the unprocessed metal. The Companys estimates are intended to reasonably reflect the quantities of unprocessed ferrous scrap metal that are used in the production of processed ferrous metal. To assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates, management periodically reviews shrink factors and performs monthly physical inventories. Due to the inherent nature of the Companys scrap metal inventories, including variations in product density, holding period, and production processes utilized to manufacture the products, physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances for scrap metal inventory such that estimates of quantities are required. To mitigate this risk, the Company further adjusts its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count is deemed to more accurately estimate the remaining volume.\nLeases\nThe Company enters into leases to obtain access to real property, machinery, and equipment assets. Most of the Companys lease obligations relate to real property leases for the Companys operating sites, including the substantial majority of its auto parts stores, and for the Companys administrative offices. The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by assessing whether it receives the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from use of the underlying asset. Lease classification, measurement, and recognition are determined at lease commencement, which is the date the underlying asset is available for use by the Company. The accounting classification of a lease is based on whether the arrangement is effectively a financed purchase of the underlying asset (finance lease) or not (operating lease). Leases that, at lease commencement, have a non-cancellable lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to either purchase the underlying asset or renew the lease beyond 12 months that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise are classified as short-term leases and are not recognized on the balance sheet.\n64 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor leases other than short-term leases, the Company recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based primarily on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at lease commencement. Right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use the underlying asset during the lease term, while lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make future lease payments. The lease term is the non-cancellable period of the lease, together with periods covered by renewal (or termination) options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (or not to exercise). Lease payments are discounted to present value using the Companys incremental borrowing rate unless the discount rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. The Companys incremental borrowing rate for each lease is the estimated rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow the aggregate lease payments on a collateralized basis over the lease term. Estimation of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment by management and reflects an assessment of the Companys credit standing to derive an implied secured credit rating and corresponding yield curve. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are subject to remeasurement after lease commencement when certain events or changes in circumstances arise, such as a change in the lease term due to reassessment of whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal or termination option.\nFor operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, the lease right-of-use asset is amortized on a straight-line basis and interest expense is recognized on the lease liability using the effective interest rate method. Many of the Companys real property leases contain variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, which are included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability using the index or rate at lease commencement. Subsequent changes in variable lease payments are recorded as variable lease expenses during the period in which they are incurred. The Company elected a practical expedient to not separate lease and related non-lease components for accounting purposes and, thus, costs related to such non-lease components are disclosed as lease expense. Payments for short-term leases are recognized in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See Note 5 - Leases for further detail.\nThe Company leases machinery assets to customers primarily to facilitate the provision of recycling services. For the periods presented, such lessor arrangements were classified as operating leases, whereby the Company keeps the asset underlying the lease on its balance sheet and depreciates the asset based on its estimated useful life. The Company recognizes lease income for these operating leases on a straight-line basis within revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of both August 31, 2023 and 2022, property, plant and equipment, net, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, included machinery assets underlying these operating leases with a carrying value of $13 million. Lease income derived from these operating leases was not material to any of the periods presented.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized, while routine repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Interest cost related to the construction of qualifying assets is capitalized as part of the construction costs. When assets are retired or sold, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and resulting gains or losses are generally included in operating expense. Gains and losses from sales of assets related to an exit activity are reported within restructuring charges and other exit-related activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Upon idling an asset, depreciation continues to be recorded. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining lease term.\nAs of August 31, 2023, the useful lives used for depreciation and amortization were as follows:\nUseful Life\n(in years)\nMachinery and equipment\n3 to 40\nLand improvements\n3 to 35\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n5 to 40\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems\n5 to 10\nOffice equipment and other software licenses\n3 to 10\nPrepaid Expenses\nThe Companys prepaid expenses, reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $27 million and $43 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and consisted primarily of deposits on capital projects, prepaid insurance, prepaid services, and prepaid property taxes.\n65 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther Assets\nThe Companys other assets, exclusive of prepaid expenses and assets relating to certain employee benefit plans, consisted primarily of receivables from insurers, cash held in a client trust account relating to a legal settlement, two equity investments, capitalized implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements, debt issuance costs, notes and other contractual receivables, and major spare parts and equipment. Other assets are reported within either prepaid expenses and other current assets or other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on their expected use either during or beyond the current operating cycle of one year from the reporting date. See Note 13 - Employee Benefits for further detail on the Companys assets relating to employee benefit plans.\nReceivables from insurers represent the portion of insured losses expected to be recovered from the Companys insurers.under various insurance policies or from a Qualified Settlement Fund holding settlement amounts deposited by certain insurers of claims against the Company related to the Portland Harbor Superfund site. The receivables are recorded at an amount not to exceed the recorded loss and only if the terms of legally enforceable insurance contracts support that the insurance recovery will not be disputed and is deemed collectible, or if recovery of the loss by the Company from a Qualified Settlement Fund is probable. Receivables from insurers totaled $14 million and $28 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of August 31, 2023, receivables from insurers comprised primarily $10 million relating to environmental claims, $2 million relating to workers compensation claims, $1 million relating to third-party claims, and $1 million relating to property loss and damage and other claims in connection with the December 2021 fire at the Companys shredder facility in Everett, Massachusetts. As of August 31, 2022, receivables from insurers comprised primarily $10 million relating to claims in connection with the Everett facility shredder fire, $7 million relating to environmental claims, $6 million relating to third-party claims, and $4 million relating to workers compensation claims. See Accounting for Impacts of Involuntary Events below in this Note for further discussion of receivables and advance payments from insurers relating to property damage and business interruption claims.\nOther assets as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022 also included approximately $7 million in connection with cash deposited into a client trust account in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 to fund the remediation of a site, a portion of which was previously leased to and operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. The cash was deposited into the client trust account by other potentially liable parties in connection with settlement of a lawsuit relating to allocation of the remediation costs, including agreement by the Companys subsidiary to perform certain remedial actions. See Other Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies within Contingencies - Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion of this matter.\nThe Company invested $5 million in the equity of a privately-held Canadian recycling technology entity in May 2022. The Company's influence over the operating and financial policies of the entity is not significant, and, thus, the investment is accounted for under the guidance for investments in equity securities. The equity investment does not have a readily determinable fair value and, therefore, is carried at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes. The investment is reported within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying value of the investment as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022 was $5 million. The Company has not recorded any impairments or upward or downward adjustments to the carrying value of the investment since acquisition.\nThe Company invested $6 million in the equity of a privately-held U.S. waste and recycling entity in fiscal 2017. The investment is accounted for under the guidance for investments in equity securities. In August 2022, the privately-held entity merged with a publicly-traded U.S. entity. As a result of the merger, the Company's investment became held in equity units of a subsidiary of the publicly-traded entity, which equity units are not publicly traded but are exchangeable for shares of the publicly-traded entity. The timing and magnitude of exchange is solely at the discretion of the publicly-traded entity. During the first half of fiscal 2023, because of these exchange conditions, the equity investment was determined to not have a readily determinable fair value and, therefore, continued to be carried at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company identified an impairment indicator for its investment and, based on its fair value measurement incorporating observable trading prices of the publicly-traded entity and unobservable inputs, recognized a $4 million impairment within other loss, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the publicly-traded entity allowed for an exchange event, and the Company exchanged its full investment in the subsidiary's equity units for shares of the publicly-traded entity, which have a readily determinable fair value, and which the Company still held as of August 31, 2023. As a result, in fiscal 2023 following the exchange event, the Company recorded an additional $1 million, net, downward adjustment of the equity investment to its fair value of $1 million as of August 31, 2023, which loss is reported within other loss, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The investment is reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets as of August 31, 2023, and within other assets as of August 31, 2022, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n66 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Companys cloud computing arrangements primarily comprise hosting arrangements which are service contracts, whereby the Company gains remote access to use enterprise software hosted by the vendor or another third party on an as-needed basis for a period of time in exchange for a subscription fee. Subscription fees are usually prepaid and recorded in operating expense over the period that the Company has access to use the software. Implementation costs for cloud computing arrangements are capitalized if certain criteria are met and consist of internal and external costs directly attributable to developing and configuring cloud computing software for its intended use. Amortization of capitalized implementation costs is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the cloud computing arrangement, which is the non-cancellable period of the agreement, together with periods covered by renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. During fiscal 2023, in connection with the pursuit of an alternative solution, the Company abandoned the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement and recorded a $5 million impairment associated with previously capitalized cloud computing arrangement implementation costs. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company's capitalized cloud computing implementation costs were $5 million and $10 million, respectively.\nDebt issuance costs consist primarily of costs incurred by the Company to enter or modify its credit facilities. The Company reports deferred debt issuance costs within other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes them to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement.\nNotes and other contractual receivables consist primarily of advances to entities in the business of extracting scrap metal through demolition and other activities. Repayment of these advances to suppliers is in either cash or scrap metal. The Company performs periodic reviews of its notes and other contractual receivables to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectibility of the receivables, which typically involves consideration of the value of collateral which in the case of advances to suppliers is generally in the form of scrap metal extracted from demolition and construction projects. A note or other contractual receivable is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the agreement. If the carrying value of the receivable exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment is recorded for the difference.\nAccounting for Impacts of Involuntary Events\nAssets destroyed or damaged as a result of involuntary events are written off or reduced in carrying value to their salvage value. When recovery of all or a portion of the amount of property damage loss or other covered expenses through insurance proceeds is demonstrated to be probable, a receivable is recorded and offsets the loss or expense up to the amount of the total loss or expense. No gain is recorded until all contingencies related to the insurance claim have been resolved.\nOn May 22, 2021, the Company experienced a fire at its steel mill in McMinnville, Oregon. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the mills melt shop, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to other buildings or equipment. The rolling mill production ceased in early June 2021. In August 2021, the steel mill began ramping up operations following the substantial completion of replacement and repairs of property and equipment in the melt shop that had been lost or damaged by the fire. The Company experienced loss of business income during the shutdown of the steel mill and the subsequent ramp-up phase which was substantially completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. The Company filed insurance claims for the physical loss and damage experienced at the mill's melt shop and business income losses resulting from the matter. In fiscal 2021, the Company recognized an initial $10 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain, the latter reported within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, primarily offsetting applicable losses incurred including capital purchases of $10 million that had been incurred by the Company as of the end of the fiscal year. In fiscal 2022, the Company increased the amount of this insurance receivable to $25 million and recognized a related $15 million insurance recovery gain within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses incurred as a result of the fire to date. In addition, during fiscal 2022, the Company received advance payments from insurers totaling approximately $30 million towards its claims, which amount reduced the $25 million insurance receivable to zero with the remaining amount of advance payments of $5 million reported within other accrued liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2022. In fiscal 2023, the Company received additional cash payments from insurers towards its claims totaling approximately $22 million, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 the Company reached a full and final settlement with its insurers for its claims and recognized an additional $27 million insurance recovery gain within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses including business income losses incurred as a result of the fire.\nOn December 8, 2021, the Company experienced a fire at its metals recycling facility in Everett, Massachusetts. Direct physical loss or damage to property from the incident was limited to the facilitys shredder building and equipment, with no bodily injuries and no physical loss or damage to property reported at other buildings or equipment. As a result of the fire, shredding operations ceased, while all non-shredding operations at the facility continued, including torching, shearing, separating, and sorting purchased non-shreddable recycled ferrous metals. On January 28, 2022, shredding operations at the facility began ramping up following the replacement and\n67 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrepairs to shredder equipment that had been damaged. In addition, shredding operations temporarily ceased at the facility on June 18, 2022 and, following discussions with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection and the Massachusetts Attorney Generals office, the Company installed a temporary emission capture system and controls that allowed for the resumption of shredding operations on November 11, 2022 and for continued operation during the repair and replacement of the shredder enclosure building. Non-shredding operations at the facility continued during this period. The repair and replacement of most property that experienced physical loss or damage, primarily buildings and improvements, was substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2023. The Company filed insurance claims for the property that experienced physical loss or damage and anticipated business income losses resulting from the matter. In fiscal 2022, after the fire, the Company recognized an aggregate $17 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain. In fiscal 2023, the Company recognized an additional $16 million insurance receivable and related insurance recovery gain. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had recognized a total of $34 million in insurance recovery gains, all reported within cost of goods sold on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, reflecting recovery of applicable losses to date including impairment charges of $7 million related to the carrying value of plant and equipment assets lost in or damaged by the fire, and capital purchases, non-capitalizable repair and replacement costs, and other applicable losses totaling $27 million that had been incurred as of August 31, 2023. Also, during fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company received advance payments from insurers totaling approximately $26 million and $7 million, respectively, towards its claims, and not reflecting any final or full settlement of claims with the insurers, which amount reduced the insurance receivable to $1 million and $10 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The insurance receivable is reported within prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is determined based on the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Operating lease right-of-use assets are considered long-lived assets subject to this impairment testing. For the Companys metals recycling operations, an asset group generally consists of the regional shredding operation along with surrounding feeder operations, except that the combined Oregon metals recycling and steel manufacturing operations is a single asset group. For the Companys auto parts operations, generally each auto parts store is an asset group. The Company tests its asset groups for impairment when certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset group may be impaired. If the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable because it exceeds the Companys estimate of future undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized by the amount the carrying value exceeds its fair value, if any. The impairment loss is allocated to the long-lived assets of the group on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, except that the loss allocated to an individual long-lived asset of the group shall not reduce the carrying amount of that asset below its fair value. Fair value is determined using one or more of the income, market, or cost approaches, depending on the nature of the asset group.\nWith respect to individual long-lived assets, changes in circumstances may merit a change in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of the assets, which are accounted for prospectively in the period of change. For such assets, the useful life is shortened based on the Companys plans to dispose of or abandon the asset before the end of its original useful life and depreciation is accelerated beginning when that determination is made.\nLong-lived asset impairment charges (recoveries) and accelerated depreciation are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within (1) asset impairment charges, net and (2) restructuring charges and other exit-related activities if related to a site closure. In fiscal 2023 and 2022, the Company reported less than $1 million and $2 million, respectively, of impairments of long-lived assets within asset impairment charges, net related primarily to abandonment of obsolete machinery and equipment assets.\nInvestments in Joint Ventures\nAs of August 31, 2022, the Company had two 50%-owned joint venture interests and on November 7, 2022, the Company sold its ownership interest in one of the 50%-owned joint ventures for approximately $2 million. No gain or loss was recognized as a result of the sale. As of August 31, 2023, the Company had one 50%-owned joint venture interest which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. This remaining joint venture sells recycled metal to the Companys operations at prices that approximate local market rates, which produces intercompany profit. This intercompany profit is eliminated while the products remain in inventory and is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties. As of August 31, 2023, the Companys investments in equity method joint ventures have generated $9 million in cumulative undistributed earnings. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions for further detail on transactions with joint ventures.\n68 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA loss in value of an investment in a joint venture is recognized when the decline is other than temporary. Management considers all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investments including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the joint venture business, and the Companys intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Once management determines that an other-than-temporary impairment exists, the investment is written down to its fair value, which establishes a new cost basis. The Company determines fair value using Level 3 inputs under the fair value hierarchy using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow analysis.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the net amount of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination measured at fair value. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired. Impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). A component of an operating segment is required to be identified as a reporting unit if the component is a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews its operating results.\nWhen testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more-likely-than-not, the Company is then required to perform the quantitative impairment test, otherwise no further analysis is required. The Company also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. When performing the quantitative impairment test, the Company applies a one-step quantitative test and records the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nWhen the Company performs a quantitative goodwill impairment test, it estimates the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based weighted average cost of capital (WACC) determined separately for the reporting unit. The determination of fair value involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including regarding revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general, and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, to corroborate the reporting units income approach valuation, as well as to estimate the fair value of the Companys other reporting units, including those with no allocated goodwill, the Company uses a market approach based on earnings multiple data, and it performs a reconciliation of its estimate of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to the Companys market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net for further detail including the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge of $39 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, representing a portion of the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to one reporting unit.\nThe Company tests indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If the Company believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The Company did not record impairment charges on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the periods presented. See Note 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net for further detail.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nThe Company recognizes the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date, measured at their fair values as of that date. Contingent purchase consideration is recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition. Any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Within one year from the date of acquisition, the Company may update the value allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill balance as a result of information received regarding the valuation of such assets and liabilities that was not available at the time of purchase. Measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires the Company to determine the price that would be paid by a third-party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 7 - Business Acquisitions for further detail.\n69 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestructuring Charges and Other Exit-Related Activities\nRestructuring charges consist of severance, contract termination, and other restructuring-related costs. A liability for severance costs is typically recognized when the plan of termination has been communicated to the affected employees and is measured at its fair value at the communication date. A liability for contract termination or other restructuring-related costs is measured at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred. Exit-related activities consist primarily of asset impairments in connection with closure of certain operations and sites, net of gains on exit-related disposals.\nAccrued Workers Compensation Costs\nThe Company is self-insured for the significant majority of workers compensation claims with exposure limited by various stop-loss insurance policies. The Company estimates the costs of workers compensation claims based on the nature of the injury incurred and on guidelines established by the applicable state. An accrual is recorded based upon the amount of unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date. Accrued amounts recorded for individual claims are reviewed periodically as treatment progresses and adjusted to reflect additional information that becomes available. The estimated cost of claims incurred but not reported is included in the accrual. The Company accrued $5 million and $6 million for the estimated cost of unpaid workers compensation claims as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with corresponding workers compensation insurance receivables of $2 million and $4 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, included in other current assets.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nThe Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown. The Company considers various factors when estimating its environmental liabilities, and it evaluates the adequacy of these liabilities on a quarterly basis. Adjustments to the liabilities are recorded to selling, general, and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or expenditures are made for which liabilities were established. Legal investigation and defense costs incurred in connection with environmental contingencies are expensed as incurred.\nWhen only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is a better estimate than another, the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements. In a number of cases, it is possible that the Company may receive reimbursement through insurance or from other third parties for a site or matter. In these situations, recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable. The amounts recorded for environmental liabilities are reviewed periodically as assessment and remediation progresses at individual sites or for particular matters and adjusted to reflect additional information that becomes available. Due to evolving remediation technology, changing regulations, possible third-party contributions, the subjective nature of the assumptions used, and other factors, amounts accrued could vary significantly from amounts paid. See Contingencies - Environmental in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further detail.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is subject to certain legal proceedings and contingencies in addition to those related to environmental liabilities discussed above in this Note, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. The Company accrues for estimated losses if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company uses judgment and evaluates whether a loss contingency arising from litigation or an unasserted claim should be disclosed or recorded. The outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies is inherently uncertain and often difficult to estimate. Accrued legal contingencies are reported within other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Contingencies - Other in Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies for further detail.\n70 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Companys financial instruments include primarily cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and debt and derivative contracts. The Company uses the market approach to value its financial assets and liabilities, determined using available market information. The net carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. For long-term debt, which is primarily at variable interest rates, fair value is estimated using observable inputs (Level 2) and approximates the carrying value. Derivative contracts are reported at fair value. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments for further detail.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. Classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are described as follows:\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the determination of the fair value of the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are significant to the determination of the fair value of the asset or liability.\nWhen developing fair value measurements, the Company uses quoted market prices whenever available or seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when quoted market prices are not available.\nDerivatives\nThe Company records derivative instruments at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and changes in their fair value are recognized in either other comprehensive (loss) income in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income or net (loss) income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as applicable, depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative has been designated as a hedge and, if designated as a hedge, whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective. For cash flow hedges, such as the interest rate swap transactions entered by the Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, a formal assessment is made, both at the hedges inception and on an ongoing basis, to determine whether the derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is qualified, designated, and highly effective as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income and are reclassified to earnings in the period in which earnings are impacted by the hedged item. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively. When available, quoted market prices or prices obtained through external sources are used to measure a derivative instruments fair value. The fair value of these instruments is a function of underlying forward interest rates, related volatility, counterparty creditworthiness, and the duration of the contracts. The Company has elected an accounting policy to classify the cash flows from its interest rate swap derivatives designated in qualifying cash flow hedges as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the classification of cash flows from the hedged item. See Note 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments for further detail.\nDerivative contracts for commodities used in normal business operations that are settled by physical delivery, among other criteria, are eligible for and may be designated as normal purchases and normal sales. Contracts that qualify as normal purchases or normal sales are not marked-to-market. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nAssets and liabilities of the Companys operations in Canada are translated into U.S. dollars at the period-end exchange rate, revenues and expenses of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rate for the period, and cash flows of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the time of the cash flows. Translation adjustments are not included in determining net income for the period, but are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are generated from the effects of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are generally included in determining net income for the period. The Company reports these gains and losses within other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Net realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2023, 2022, or 2021.\n71 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommon Stock\nEach share of Class A and Class B common stock is entitled to one vote. Additionally, each share of Class B common stock may be converted to one share of Class A common stock. As such, the Company reserves one share of Class A common stock for each share of Class B common stock outstanding. There are currently no meaningful distinctions between the rights of holders of Class A shares and Class B shares.\nShare Repurchases\nThe Company accounts for the repurchase of stock at par value. All shares repurchased are deemed retired. Upon retirement of the shares, the Company records the difference between the weighted average cost of such shares and the par value of the stock as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital, with the excess recorded to retained earnings when additional paid-in capital is not sufficient.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue upon satisfying its promises to transfer goods or services to customers under the terms of its contracts. Nearly all of these promises, referred to as performance obligations, consist of the transfer of physical goods, including recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal, auto bodies, auto parts, and finished steel products, to customers. These performance obligations are satisfied at the point in time the Company transfers control of the goods to the customer, which in nearly all cases is when title to and risk of loss of the goods transfer to the customer. The timing of transfer of title and risk of loss is dictated by customary or explicitly stated contract terms. For example, the Company recognizes revenue on partially loaded bulk shipments of recycled ferrous metal when contractual terms support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss. The significant majority of the Companys sales involve transfer of control to the customer, and thus revenue recognition, before delivery to the customers destination; for example, upon release of the goods to the shipper. The Companys bill-and-hold arrangements involve transfer of control to the customer when the goods have been segregated from other inventory at the Companys facility and are ready for physical transfer to the customer. Shipping and handling activities that occur after a customer has obtained control of a good are accounted for as fulfillment costs rather than an additional promise in a contract. As such, shipping and handling consideration (freight revenue) is recognized when control of the goods transfers to the customer, and freight expense is accrued to cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized.\nIn certain regional markets, the Company enters into contracts whereby it arranges for, or brokers, the transfer of recyclable material between suppliers and end customers. For transactions in which the Company obtains substantive control of the material before the goods are transferred to the end customer, for example by arranging for the processing or warehousing of the material, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the gross amount of the consideration it expects to receive from the customer (as principal). Alternatively, for transactions in which the Company does not obtain substantive control of the material before the product is transferred to the end customer, the Company recognizes revenue equal to the net amount of the consideration it expects to retain after paying the supplier for the purchase of the material (as agent). The Company is the agent in the transaction for the substantial majority of brokerage arrangements.\nNearly all of the Companys sales contracts reflect market pricing at the time the contract is executed, are one year or less, and generally provide for shipment within 30 to 60 days after the price has been agreed upon with the customer. The Companys retail auto parts sales are at listed prices and are recognized at the point of sale.\nThe Company recognizes revenue based on contractually stated selling prices and quantities shipped, net of sales tax, and adjusted for estimated claims and discounts. Claims are customary in the recycled metal industry and arise from variances in the quantity or quality of delivered products. Revenue adjustments may be required if the settlement of claims exceeds original estimates. Discounts offered to certain finished steel customers qualify as variable consideration as the discounts are contingent upon future events. Variable consideration arising from discounts is recognized upon the transfer of finished steel products to customers based upon either the expected value or the most likely amount and was not material for each of the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. The Company experiences very few sales returns and, therefore, no material provisions for returns have been made when sales are recognized. For each of the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, revenue adjustments related to performance obligations that were satisfied in previous periods were not material.\nAdvertising Costs\nThe Company expenses advertising costs when incurred. Advertising expense was $5 million for the year ended August 31 2023, and $6 million for each of the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021.\n72 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the grant-date fair value of stock-based compensation awards based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the date of grant, except for performance share awards with a total shareholder return (TSR) market condition for which the Company estimates the grant-date fair value using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The Company recognizes compensation cost for all awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation cost is based on the grant-date fair value as described above, except for performance share awards with a non-market performance condition. For these awards, compensation cost is based on the probable outcome of achieving the specified performance conditions. The Company reassesses whether achievement of the performance condition is probable at each reporting date and, if probable, the level of achievement. See Note 14 - Share-Based Compensation for further detail.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. This requires the recognition of taxes currently payable or refundable and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that are recognized in one reporting period in the Consolidated Financial Statements but in a different reporting period on the tax returns. Tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be realized. The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. The Company considers all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. Tax benefits arising from uncertain tax positions are recognized when it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant tax authorities. The amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. The Company recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 16 - Income Taxes for further detail.\nNet (Loss) Income Per Share\nBasic net (loss) income per share attributable to Radius shareholders is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to Radius shareholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period presented including vested deferred stock units (DSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs) meeting certain criteria. Diluted net (loss) income per share attributable to Radius shareholders is computed by dividing net (loss) income attributable to Radius shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, assuming dilution. Potentially dilutive common shares include the assumed vesting of DSU, RSU, and performance share awards using the treasury stock method. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is deducted from (loss) income from continuing operations to arrive at (loss) income from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders for the purpose of calculating (loss) income per share from continuing operations attributable to Radius shareholders. See Note 17 - Net (Loss) Income Per Share for further detail.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Examples include revenue recognition; the allowance for credit losses; estimates of contingencies, including environmental liabilities and other legal liabilities; goodwill, long-lived asset and indefinite-lived intangible asset valuation; valuation of equity investments; valuation of certain share-based awards; other asset valuation; inventory measurement and valuation; pension plan assumptions; and the assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies. Actual results may differ from estimated amounts.\n73 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments. The majority of cash and cash equivalents is maintained with major financial institutions. Balances with these and certain other institutions exceeded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured amount of $250 thousand as of August 31, 2023. Concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Companys customer base. The Company controls credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits, credit insurance, letters of credit or other collateral, cash deposits, and monitoring procedures. The Company is exposed to a residual credit risk with respect to open letters of credit by virtue of the possibility of the failure of a bank providing a letter of credit. The counterparties to the Company's derivative financial instruments are major financial institutions.\nNote 3 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-05, Business Combinations - Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement, which clarifies the business combination accounting for joint venture formations. The amendments in the ASU seek to reduce diversity in practice that has resulted from a lack of authoritative guidance regarding the accounting for the formation of joint ventures in separate financial statements. The amendments also seek to clarify the initial measurement of joint venture net assets, including businesses contributed to a joint venture. The guidance is applicable to all entities involved in the formation of a joint venture. The amendments are effective beginning in the Companys fiscal 2025 and are applied prospectively to all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. Early adoption and retrospective application of the amendments are permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of the new guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nNote 4 - Inventories\nInventories consisted of the following as of August 31 (in thousands):\nProcessed and unprocessed scrap metal\n$\n143,986\n$\n166,368\nSemi-finished goods\n9,959\n20,009\nFinished goods\n60,348\n72,625\nSupplies\n64,349\n56,187\nInventories\n$\n278,642\n$\n315,189\n74 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 5 - Leases\nThe Companys operating leases for real property underlying certain auto parts stores, metals recycling facilities, and administrative offices generally have non-cancellable lease terms of 5 to 10 years, and the significant majority contain multiple renewal options for a further 5 to 20 years. Renewal options which the Company is reasonably certain to exercise are included in the measurement of lease term. The Companys finance leases and other operating leases involve primarily transportation equipment assets, have non-cancellable lease terms of less than 10 years and usually do not include renewal options.\nThe Companys fiscal 2023 total lease cost was $38 million, consisting primarily of operating lease expense of $25 million and short-term lease expense of $10 million. The Companys fiscal 2022 total lease cost was $36 million, consisting primarily of operating lease expense of $25 million and short-term lease expense of $10 million. The Companys fiscal 2021 total lease cost was $30 million, consisting primarily of operating lease expense of $24 million and short-term lease expense of $5 million. The other components of the Companys total lease cost for each of fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, including finance lease amortization and interest expense, variable lease expense, and sublease income, were not material both individually and in aggregate. The substantial majority of the Companys total lease cost for each of fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021 is presented within cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nFinance lease assets and liabilities consisted of the following as of August 31 (in thousands):\nBalance Sheet Classification\nAssets:\nFinance lease right-of-use assets(1)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n6,340\n$\n4,861\nLiabilities:\nFinance lease liabilities - current\nShort-term borrowings\n$\n2,227\n$\n1,736\nFinance lease liabilities - noncurrent\nLong-term debt, net of current maturities\n4,973\n4,158\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n7,200\n$\n5,894\n(1)Presented net of accumulated amortization of $6 million and $4 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe weighted average remaining lease terms and weighted average discount rates for the Companys leases as of August 31:\nWeighted Average\nRemaining Lease\nTerm (Years)\nWeighted Average\nDiscount Rate\nWeighted Average\nRemaining Lease\nTerm (Years)\nWeighted Average\nDiscount Rate\nOperating leases\n9.2\n3.73\n%\n9.5\n3.36\n%\nFinance leases\n4.3\n6.10\n%\n4.5\n7.17\n%\nMaturities of lease liabilities by fiscal year as of August 31, 2023 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending August 31,\nFinance Leases\nOperating Leases\n$\n2,558\n$\n23,768\n1,746\n19,391\n1,262\n15,503\n1,103\n13,546\n10,901\nThereafter\n55,434\nTotal lease payments\n8,053\n138,543\nLess amounts representing interest\n(853\n)\n(22,622\n)\nTotal lease liabilities\n7,200\n115,921\nLess current maturities\n(2,227\n)\n(19,835\n)\nLease liabilities, net of current maturities\n$\n4,973\n$\n96,086\n75 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSupplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to leases are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended August 31,\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows for operating leases\n$\n25,414\n$\n25,351\n$\n24,154\nOperating cash flows for finance leases\n$\n$\n$\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases\n$\n2,049\n$\n1,483\n$\n1,332\nLease liabilities arising from obtaining right-of-use assets(1):\nOperating leases\n$\n15,279\n$\n12,000\n$\n8,325\nFinance leases\n$\n3,596\n$\n$\n(1)Amounts include new leases and adjustments to lease balances as a result of remeasurement.\nNote 6 - Property, Plant and Equipment, net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following as of August 31 (in thousands):\nMachinery and equipment\n$\n952,480\n$\n875,904\nLand and improvements\n345,584\n324,453\nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n169,940\n148,634\nEnterprise resource planning (ERP) systems\n18,898\n18,945\nOffice equipment and other software licenses\n31,195\n30,797\nConstruction in progress\n90,939\n120,419\nProperty, plant and equipment, gross\n1,609,036\n1,519,152\nLess accumulated depreciation\n(902,231\n)\n(855,032\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net(1)\n$\n706,805\n$\n664,120\n(1)Property, plant and equipment, net included $21 million and $22 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the Companys Canadian operations.\nDepreciation expense for property, plant and equipment, which includes amortization expense for finance lease right-of-use assets, was $84 million, $72 million, and $58 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Interest cost related to the construction of qualifying assets capitalized as part of the construction costs was $4 million for the year ended August 31, 2023, and $2 million for each of the years ended August 31, 2022 and 2021.\nNote 7 - Business Acquisitions\nFiscal 2023 Business Acquisition\nOn November 18, 2022, the Company used cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities to acquire the operating assets of ScrapSource, a recycling services company that provides solutions for industrial companies that generate scrap metal from their manufacturing process. The acquired business expands the Company's national recycling services operations, giving rise to expected benefits supporting the amount of acquired goodwill. The transaction qualified as a business combination for accounting purposes, which involves application of the acquisition method described in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations, and summarized in Business Acquisitions in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The total purchase consideration was approximately $25 million. As of the date of this report, measurement of the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed is still preliminary and subject to change based on the completion of valuation procedures.\n76 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company as of the November 18, 2022 acquisition date (in thousands):\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\nGoodwill(1)\n13,105\nOther intangible assets\n11,955\nOther assets\nTotal assets acquired\n25,535\nOperating lease liability\nTotal liabilities assumed\nNet assets acquired\n$\n25,069\n(1)All of the provisional amount of acquired goodwill is tax deductible.\nThe following table summarizes the provisional purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets and their estimated useful lives as of the November 18, 2022 acquisition date (in thousands):\nUseful Life\nSupplier relationships\n$\n10,375\nNon-compete intangible assets\n1,360\nCustomer relationships\n$\n11,955\nThe results of operations for the acquired ScrapSource business beginning as of the November 18, 2022 acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Combined with the Companys regional metals recycling facilities in Georgia, Alabama, and Tennessee, the acquired operations offer additional recycling products, services, and logistics solutions to customers and suppliers across the Southeast, giving rise to expected benefits supporting the amount of acquired goodwill. The total purchase consideration of $117 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. The results of operations for the acquired Columbus Recycling business beginning as of the October 1, 2021 acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nOn April 29, 2022, the Company used cash on hand and borrowings under existing credit facilities to acquire two recycling facilities in the greater Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area, including a metal shredding operation and recycled auto-parts center from the previous owners of Encore Recycling. Combined with the Companys existing regional metals recycling facilities and recycled auto-parts centers, the acquired operations offer additional recycling products, services, and logistics solutions to customers and suppliers across portions of the Southeast, giving rise to expected benefits supporting the amount of acquired goodwill. The total purchase consideration of $64 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values on the date of the acquisition. The results of operations for the acquired Encore Recycling business beginning as of the April 29, 2022 acquisition date are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n77 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the aggregate fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by the Company in the fiscal 2022 business acquisitions as of their respective acquisition dates (in thousands):\nColumbus Recycling\nEncore Recycling\nOctober 1, 2021\nApril 29, 2022\nCash\n$\n$\n-\nAccounts receivable\n22,763\n10,356\nInventories\n10,060\n4,325\nOther current assets\nProperty, plant and equipment\n13,491\n25,027\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nGoodwill(1)\n65,203\n21,423\nOther intangible assets\n19,741\n4,809\nTotal assets acquired\n132,092\n66,357\nCurrent liabilities\n11,828\n1,323\nOther liabilities\n3,350\n1,091\nTotal liabilities assumed\n15,178\n2,414\nNet assets acquired\n$\n116,914\n$\n63,943\n(1)Approximately $62 million and $20 million of the amount of acquired goodwill for Columbus Recycling and Encore Recycling, respectively, are tax deductible.\nThe following table summarizes the purchase price allocation to the identifiable intangible assets of Columbus Recycling and Encore Recycling combined and their estimated useful lives as of their respective acquisition dates (in thousands):\nColumbus Recycling\nEncore Recycling\nUseful Life\nUseful Life\nSupplier relationships\n$\n17,245\n$\n3,679\nCustomer relationships\n2,496\n1,130\n$\n19,741\n$\n4,809\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the effect on the consolidated financial results of the Company of the Columbus Recycling and Encore Recycling businesses acquired during fiscal 2022 as though the businesses had been acquired as of the beginning of fiscal 2021 (in thousands):\nYear Ended August 31,\nRevenues\n$\n3,566,000\n$\n2,989,000\nNet income\n$\n184,500\n$\n179,000\nNet income attributable to Radius shareholders\n$\n181,000\n$\n174,500\nThere are no individually material, nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combinations included in these pro forma revenues and earnings.\nThe information included in the pro forma amounts is derived from historical information obtained from the sellers of the businesses. These pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actual results would have been had these acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2021. In addition, the pro forma results are not intended to be a projection of future results and do not reflect any synergies that may be achieved from combining operations.\nFor the fiscal years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022, the unaudited pro forma amounts of revenues and net income of the ScrapSource business acquired during fiscal 2023 were not material to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole and, therefore, are not included in the tabular disclosure of unaudited pro forma information above.\n78 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 8 - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, net\nGoodwill\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2023. As of the testing date, the balance of the Companys goodwill was $269 million, which was allocated among four reporting units. All of the approximately $13 million of goodwill carried by one of the reporting units, a recycling services operation, related to the business acquisition that was completed in fiscal 2023. The Company elected to perform the qualitative assessment for this reporting unit and concluded that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. The remaining $256 million of goodwill as of the testing date was allocated among three reporting units, which consist of two regional metals recycling operations and the Company's network of auto parts stores. Based primarily on the respective financial and operational performance of each of these three reporting units and the Company overall, as well as the year-over-year decrease in the Companys market capitalization as of the testing date, the Company elected to not perform the qualitative assessment and to proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test for goodwill allocated to the three reporting units to identify potential impairment and measure an impairment loss, if necessary. The quantitative impairment test entails estimating the fair value of each reporting unit with allocated goodwill and comparing it to the reporting units carrying amount. The Company records the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting units carrying amount over its fair value, if any, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the two metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test as of July 1, 2023 using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows, including terminal value, utilizing a market-based WACC determined separately for each reporting unit. The determination of fair value under this income approach involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including revenue growth rates driven by future ferrous and nonferrous commodity price and sales volume expectations, gross margins, selling, general, and administrative expense relative to total revenues, capital expenditures, working capital requirements, discount rate (WACC), tax rate, terminal growth rate, benefits associated with a taxable transaction, and synergistic benefits available to market participants. In addition, to corroborate each reporting units income approach valuation, as well as to estimate the fair value of the Companys other reporting units, including those with no allocated goodwill, the Company used a market approach based on earnings multiple data, and it performed a reconciliation of its estimate of the aggregate fair value of all reporting units to the Companys market capitalization, including consideration of a control premium.\nFor one of the metals recycling reporting units and the autos reporting unit subject to the quantitative impairment test, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 24% and 33%, respectively, as of July 1, 2023. For the other metals recycling reporting unit, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying amount, resulting in a partial impairment of goodwill of $39 million. The projections used in the income approach for the metals recycling and autos reporting units took into consideration, as applicable, the impact of recent and current market conditions for ferrous and nonferrous recycled metals and retail auto parts, the cost of obtaining adequate supply flows of scrap metal including end-of-life vehicles, and recent trends in production and other operating costs. The projections assumed a recovery of operating margins from the levels experienced around the time of the July 1, 2023 measurement date over a multi-year period. The WACC rate used in the income approach valuation for the two metals recycling reporting units was 13.68%, and the WACC rate used for the autos reporting unit was 13.62%. The terminal growth rate used for all three reporting units was 2%. A reporting-unit-specific risk premium is embedded in the WACC to reflect the perceived level of uncertainty inherent in each reporting unit's expected future cash flows.\nThe Company reconciled its market capitalization to the aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units, including consideration of a control premium representing the estimated amount a market participant would pay to obtain a controlling interest in the Company. The implied control premium resulting from the difference between (i) the Company's market capitalization (based on the average trading price of the Company's Class A common stock for the two-week period ended July 1, 2023) increased by the estimated fair value of noncontrolling interests and (ii) the higher aggregated estimated fair value of all reporting units was within the historical range of average and mean premiums observed for historical transactions within the steel-making, scrap processing, and metals industries. The Company identified specific reconciling items, including market participant synergies, tax amortization benefits, and benefits from in-process technology investments, which supported the implied control premium as of July 1, 2023.\n79 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe gross change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended August 31, 2023 and 2022 was as follows (in thousands):\nGoodwill\nBalance as of September 1, 2021\n$\n170,304\nAdditions(1)\n84,040\nMeasurement period adjustments(2)\n1,657\nForeign currency translation adjustment\n(803\n)\nBalance as of August 31, 2022\n255,198\nAdditions(1)\n14,759\nMeasurement period adjustments(2)\n(725\n)\nImpairments\n(39,270\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustment\n(543\n)\nBalance as of August 31, 2023\n$\n229,419\n(1)Additions to goodwill in fiscal 2022 relate to the Columbus Recycling and Encore Recycling businesses acquired on October 1, 2021 and April 29, 2022, respectively.

The weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under the credit facilities was 7.17% and 3.65% as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe credit agreement contains various representations and warranties, events of default, and financial and other customary covenants which limit (subject to certain exceptions) the Companys ability to, among other things, incur or suffer to exist certain liens, make investments, incur or guaranty additional indebtedness, enter into consolidations, mergers, acquisitions, and sales of assets, make distributions and other restricted payments, change the nature of the business, engage in transactions with affiliates, and enter into restrictive agreements, including agreements that restrict the ability of the subsidiaries to make distributions. As of August 31, 2023, the financial covenants under the credit agreement included (a) a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, defined as the four-quarter rolling sum of consolidated EBITDA less defined maintenance capital expenditures and certain environmental expenditures divided by consolidated fixed charges and (b) a consolidated leverage ratio, defined as consolidated funded indebtedness divided by the sum of consolidated net worth and consolidated funded indebtedness. The Companys obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by substantially all of its subsidiaries. The credit facilities and the related guarantees are secured by senior first priority liens on certain of the Companys and its subsidiaries assets, including equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable.\n81 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther debt obligations, which totaled $12 million and $13 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily relate to equipment purchases, the contract consideration for which includes an obligation to make future monthly payments to the vendor in the form of licensing fees. For accounting purposes, such obligations are treated as a partial financing of the purchase price by the equipment vendor. Monthly payments commence when the equipment is placed in service and achieves specified minimum operating metrics, with payments continuing for a period of four years thereafter.\nPrincipal payments on the Companys bank revolving credit facilities and other debt obligations during the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ending August 31,\nCredit Facilities\nOther Debt Obligations\n$\n-\n$\n3,586\n-\n2,449\n-\n2,564\n230,000\n2,687\n-\nThereafter\n-\nTotal\n$\n230,000\n$\n12,192\nSee Note 5 - Leases for additional disclosure on finance lease obligations, including payments during the next five fiscal years and thereafter.

These liabilities relate to the investigation and potential remediation of waterways and soil and groundwater contamination and may also involve natural resource damages, governmental fines and penalties, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. Except for Portland Harbor and certain liabilities discussed under Other Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies below, such liabilities were not individually material at any site.\nPortland Harbor\nIn December 2000, the Company was notified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) that it is one of the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) that own or operate or formerly owned or operated sites which are part of or adjacent to the Portland Harbor Superfund site (Portland Harbor).\nThe precise nature and extent of cleanup of any specific areas within Portland Harbor, the parties to be involved, the timing of any specific remedial action and the allocation of the costs for any cleanup among responsible parties have not yet been determined. The process of site investigation, remedy selection, identification of additional PRPs, and allocation of costs has been underway for a number of years, but significant uncertainties remain. It is unclear to what extent the Company will be liable for environmental costs or third-party contribution or damage claims with respect to Portland Harbor.\nFrom 2000 to 2017, the EPA oversaw a remedial investigation/feasibility study (RI/FS) at Portland Harbor. The Company was not among the parties that performed the RI/FS, but it contributed to the costs through an interim settlement with the performing parties. The performing parties have indicated that they incurred more than $155 million in that effort.\n82 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn January 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that identified the selected remedy for Portland Harbor. The EPA has estimated the total cost of the selected remedy at $1.7 billion with a net present value cost of $1.05 billion (at a 7% discount rate) and an estimated construction period of 13 years following completion of the remedial designs. In the ROD, the EPA stated that the cost estimate is an order-of-magnitude engineering estimate that is expected to be within +50% to -30% of the actual project cost and that changes in the cost elements are likely to occur as a result of new information and data collected during the engineering design. Accordingly, the final cost may differ materially from that set forth in the ROD. The Company has identified a number of concerns regarding the remedy described in the ROD, which is based on data that is more than 15 years old, and the EPAs estimates for the costs and time required to implement the selected remedy. Moreover, the ROD provided only Portland Harbor site-wide cost estimates and did not provide sufficient detail to estimate costs for specific sediment management areas within Portland Harbor. In addition, the ROD did not determine or allocate the responsibility for remediation costs among the PRPs.\nIn the ROD, the EPA acknowledged that much of the data was more than a decade old at that time and would need to be updated with a new round of baseline sampling to be conducted prior to the remedial design phase. The remedial design phase is an engineering phase during which additional technical information and data are collected, identified, and incorporated into technical drawings and specifications developed for the subsequent remedial action. Following issuance of the ROD, the EPA proposed that the PRPs, or a subgroup of PRPs, perform the additional investigative work in advance of remedial design.\nIn December 2017, the Company and three other PRPs entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent with the EPA to perform such pre-remedial design investigation and baseline sampling over a two-year period. The report analyzing the results concluded that Portland Harbor conditions have improved substantially since the data forming the basis of the ROD was collected. The EPA found with a few limited corrections that the new baseline data is of suitable quality and stated that such data will be used, in addition to existing and forthcoming design-level data, to inform implementation of the ROD. However, the EPA did not agree that the data or the analysis warranted a change to the remedy at this time and reaffirmed its commitment to proceed with remedial design. The Company and other PRPs disagree with the EPAs position on use of the more recent data and will continue to pursue limited, but critical, changes to the selected remedy for Portland Harbor during the remedial design phase.\nThe EPA encouraged PRPs to step forward (individually or in groups) to enter into consent agreements to perform remedial design in various project areas covering Portland Harbor. While certain PRPs executed consent agreements for remedial design work, because of the EPAs refusal to date to modify the remedy to reflect the most current data on Portland Harbor conditions and because of concerns with the terms of the consent agreement, the Company elected not to enter into a consent agreement. In April 2020, the EPA issued a unilateral administrative order (UAO) to the Company and MMGL, LLC (MMGL), an unaffiliated company, for the remedial design work in a portion of Portland Harbor designated as the River Mile 3.5 East Project Area. As required by the UAO, the Company notified the EPA of its intent to comply while reserving all of its sufficient cause defenses. Failure to comply with a UAO, without sufficient cause, could subject the Company to significant penalties or treble damages. Pursuant to the optimized remedial design timeline set forth in the UAO, the EPAs expected schedule for completion of the remedial design work was four years. At the time it issued the UAO in April 2020, the EPA estimated the cost of the work at approximately $4 million. The Company has agreed with the other respondent to the UAO, MMGL, that the Company will lead the performance and be responsible for a portion of the costs of the work for remedial design under the UAO and also entered into an agreement with another PRP pursuant to which such other PRP has agreed to fund a portion of the costs of such work. These agreements are not an allocation of liability or claims associated with Portland Harbor as between the respondents or with respect to any third party. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $1 million and $3 million, respectively, in environmental reserves related to this matter. The Company has insurance policies and Qualified Settlement Funds (QSFs) pursuant to which the Company is being reimbursed for the costs it has incurred for remedial design. See further discussion of the QSFs below in this Note. As of both August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had insurance and other receivables in the same amount as the environmental reserves for such remedial design work under the UAO. See Other Assets in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of insurance and other related receivables. The Company also expects to pursue in the future allocation or contribution from other PRPs for a portion of such remedial design costs. In February 2021, the EPA announced that 100 percent of Portland Harbors areas requiring active cleanup are in the remedial design phase of the process.\nExcept for certain early action projects in which the Company is not involved, remediation activities at Portland Harbor are not expected to commence for a number of years. Moreover, those activities are expected to be sequenced, and the order and timing of such sequencing has not been determined. In addition, as noted above, the ROD does not determine the allocation of costs among PRPs.\nThe Company has joined with approximately 100 other PRPs, including the RI/FS performing parties, in a voluntary process to establish an allocation of costs at Portland Harbor, including the costs incurred in the RI/FS, ongoing remedial design costs, and future remedial action costs. The Company expects the next major stage of the allocation process to proceed in parallel with the remedial design process.\n83 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn addition to the remedial action process overseen by the EPA, the Portland Harbor Natural Resource Trustee Council (Trustee Council) is assessing natural resource damages at Portland Harbor. In 2008, the Trustee Council invited the Company and other PRPs to participate in funding and implementing the Natural Resource Injury Assessment for Portland Harbor. The Company and other participating PRPs ultimately agreed to fund the first two phases of the three-phase assessment, which included the development of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment Plan (AP) and implementation of the AP to develop information sufficient to facilitate early settlements between the Trustee Council and Phase 2 participants and the identification of restoration projects to be funded by the settlements. In late May 2018, the Trustee Council published notice of its intent to proceed with Phase 3, which will involve the full implementation of the AP and the final injury and damage determination. The Company is proceeding with the process established by the Trustee Council regarding early settlements under Phase 2. The Company has established an environmental reserve of approximately $2.3 million for this alleged natural resource damages liability as it continues to work with the Trustee Council to finalize an early settlement. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had a receivable in the same amount as the environmental reserve. See Other Assets in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of insurance and other related receivables.\nOn January 30, 2017, one of the Trustees, the Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, which withdrew from the council in 2009, filed a suit against approximately 30 parties, including the Company, seeking reimbursement of certain past and future response costs in connection with remedial action at Portland Harbor and recovery of assessment costs related to natural resources damages from releases at and from Portland Harbor to the Multnomah Channel and the Lower Columbia River. The parties filed various motions to dismiss or stay this suit, and in August 2019, the court issued an order denying the motions to dismiss and staying the action. The Company intends to defend against the claims in this suit and does not have sufficient information to determine the likelihood of a loss in this matter or to estimate the amount of damages being sought or the amount of such damages that could be allocated to the Company.\nThe Companys environmental liabilities as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 included $5 million and $6 million, respectively, relating to the Portland Harbor matters described above.\nBecause the final remedial actions have not yet been designed and there has not been a determination of the allocation among the PRPs of costs of the investigations or remedial action costs, the Company believes it is not possible to reasonably estimate the amount or range of costs which it is likely to or which it is reasonably possible that it will incur in connection with Portland Harbor, although such costs could be material to the Companys financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Among the facts being evaluated are detailed information on the history of ownership of and the nature of the uses of and activities and operations performed on each property within Portland Harbor, which are factors that will play a substantial role in determining the allocation of investigation and remedy costs among the PRPs.\nThe Company has insurance policies that it believes will provide reimbursement for costs it incurs for defense, remediation, and mitigation for or settlement of natural resource damages claims in connection with Portland Harbor although there are no assurances that those policies will cover all the costs which the Company may incur. Most of these policies jointly insure the Company and MMGL, as the successor to a former subsidiary of the Company. The Company and MMGL have negotiated the settlement with certain insurers of claims against them related to Portland Harbor, continue to seek settlements with other insurers, and formed two QSFs which became operative in fiscal 2020 and the second quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively, to hold such settlement amounts until funds are needed to pay or reimburse costs incurred by the Company and MMGL in connection with Portland Harbor. These insurance policies and the funds in the QSFs may not cover all of the costs which the Company may incur. Each QSF is an unconsolidated variable interest entity (VIE) with no primary beneficiary. Two managers unrelated to each other, one appointed by the Company and one appointed by MMGL, share equally the power to direct the activities of each VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Companys appointee to co-manage each VIE is an executive officer of the Company. Neither MMGL nor its appointee to co-manage each VIE is a related party of the Company for the purpose of the primary beneficiary assessment or otherwise.\nThe Oregon Department of Environmental Quality is separately providing oversight of investigations and source control activities by the Company at various sites adjacent to Portland Harbor that are focused on controlling any current uplands releases of contaminants into the Willamette River. The Company has accrued liabilities for source control and related work at two sites, reflecting estimated costs of primarily investigation and design, which costs have not been material in the aggregate to date. No liabilities have been established in connection with investigations for any other sites because the extent of contamination, required source control work, and the Companys responsibility for the contamination and source control work, in each case if any, have not yet been determined. The Company believes that, pursuant to its insurance policies, it will be reimbursed for the costs it incurs for required source control evaluation and remediation work; however, the Company's insurance policies may not cover all the costs which the Company incurs. As of both August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had an insurance receivable in the same amount as the environmental reserve for such source control work.\n84 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOther Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies\nThe Companys environmental loss contingencies as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, other than Portland Harbor, include actual or possible investigation and remediation costs from historical contamination at sites currently or formerly owned or formerly operated by the Company or at other sites where the Company may have responsibility for such costs due to past disposal or other activities (legacy environmental loss contingencies). These legacy environmental loss contingencies relate to the potential remediation of waterways and soil and groundwater contamination and may also involve natural resource damages, governmental fines and penalties, and claims by third parties for personal injury and property damage. The Company has been notified that it is or may be a potentially responsible party at certain of these sites, and investigation and remediation activities are ongoing or may be required in the future. The Company recognizes a liability for such matters when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. When investigation, allocation, and remediation activities are ongoing or where the Company has not yet been identified as having responsibility or the contamination has not yet been identified, it is reasonably possible that the Company may need to recognize additional liabilities in connection with such sites but the Company cannot currently reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss absent additional information or developments. Such additional liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, may have a material adverse effect on the Companys results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\nIn fiscal 2018, the Company accrued $4 million for the estimated costs related to remediation of shredder residue disposed of in or around the 1970s at third-party sites located near each other. Investigation activities have been conducted under oversight of the applicable state regulatory agency. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $4 million accrued for this matter. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company previously estimated a range of reasonably possible losses related to this matter in excess of current accruals at between zero and $28 million based on a range of remedial alternatives and subject to development and approval by regulators of specific remedy implementation plans. However, subsequent to the development of those remedial alternatives, the Company performed additional investigative activities under new state requirements that are likely to impact the required remedial actions and associated cost estimates, but the scope of such impacts and the amount or the range of the additional associated costs are not reasonably estimable at this time and are subject to further investigation, analysis, and discussion by the Company and regulators. The Company is investigating whether a portion or all of the current and future losses related to this matter, if incurred, are covered by existing insurance coverage or may be offset by contributions from other responsible parties.\nIn addition, the Companys loss contingencies as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 included $5 million and $8 million, respectively, for the estimated costs related to environmental matters in connection with a closed facility owned and previously operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary, including monitoring and remediation of soil and groundwater conditions and funding for wellhead treatment facilities. In fiscal 2023, the Company accrued an incremental $7 million for certain soil remediation activities based on additional information related to estimated costs to complete. Investigation and remediation activities have been conducted under the oversight of the applicable state regulatory agency and are on-going, and the Company's subsidiary has also been working with state and local officials with respect to the protection of public and private water supplies. As part of its activities relating to the protection of public water supplies, the Companys subsidiary agreed to reimburse the municipality for certain studies and plans and to provide funding for the construction and operation by the municipality of wellhead treatment facilities. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such additional losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. However, the Company cannot reasonably estimate at this time the possible additional loss or range of possible additional losses associated with this matter pending the on-going implementation of the approved remediation plans for soil and groundwater conditions and completion and operation of the wellhead treatment facilities.\nIn addition, the Companys loss contingencies as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 included $10 million and $7 million, respectively, for the estimated costs related to remediation of a site a portion of which was previously leased to and operated by an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with settlement of a lawsuit relating to allocation of the remediation costs, the Companys subsidiary agreed to perform the remedial action related to metals contamination on the site initially estimated to cost approximately $7.9 million, and another potentially liable party agreed to perform the remedial action related to creosote contamination at the site. As part of the settlement, other potentially liable parties agreed to make payments totaling approximately $7.6 million to fund the remediation of the metals contamination at the site in exchange for a release and indemnity. This amount was fully funded into a client trust account for the Companys subsidiary in December 2020. See Other Assets in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion of this client trust account. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company increased its estimate of the cost to perform the remedial action by approximately $3 million. It is reasonably possible that the Company may recognize additional liabilities in connection with this matter at the time such additional losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company estimates the reasonably possible additional losses associated with this matter to range from zero to $10 million as of August 31, 2023, pending completion, approval, and implementation of the remediation action plan.\n85 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSummary - Environmental Contingencies\nWith respect to environmental contingencies other than the Portland Harbor Superfund site and the Other Legacy Environmental Loss Contingencies, which are discussed separately above, management currently believes that adequate provision has been made for the potential impact of its environmental contingencies. Historically, the amounts the Company has ultimately paid for such remediation activities have not been material in any given period, but there can be no assurance that such amounts paid will not be material in the future.\nContingencies - Other\nIn addition to legal proceedings relating to the contingencies described above, the Company is a party to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. The Company recognizes a liability for such matters when the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not anticipate that the liabilities arising from such legal proceedings in the normal course of business, after taking into consideration expected insurance recoveries, will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.\n86 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 11 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, are as follows as of August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 (in thousands):\nForeign Currency\nTranslation\nAdjustments\nCash Flow Hedges, net\nPension Obligations,\nnet\nTotal\nBalance as of September 1, 2020\n$\n(34,184\n)\n$\n-\n$\n(2,687\n)\n$\n(36,871\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n2,575\n-\n(530\n)\n2,045\nIncome tax benefit\n-\n-\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications,\nnet of tax\n2,575\n-\n(410\n)\n2,165\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n-\n-\nIncome tax benefit\n-\n-\n(44\n)\n(44\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss,\nnet of tax\n-\n-\nNet periodic other comprehensive income (loss)\n2,575\n-\n(258\n)\n2,317\nBalance as of August 31, 2021\n(31,609\n)\n-\n(2,945\n)\n(34,554\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n(3,070\n)\n-\n(2,715\n)\nIncome tax expense\n-\n-\n(80\n)\n(80\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications,\nnet of tax\n(3,070\n)\n-\n(2,795\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n-\n-\nIncome tax benefit\n-\n-\n(76\n)\n(76\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss,\nnet of tax\n-\n-\nNet periodic other comprehensive (loss) income\n(3,070\n)\n-\n(2,535\n)\nBalance as of August 31, 2022\n(34,679\n)\n-\n(2,410\n)\n(37,089\n)\nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications\n(2,661\n)\n(277\n)\n(2\n)\n(2,940\n)\nIncome tax benefit\n-\n-\nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications,\nnet of tax\n(2,661\n)\n(215\n)\n(2\n)\n(2,878\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n-\n(115\n)\nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n-\n(108\n)\n(82\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss,\nnet of tax\n-\n(89\n)\nNet periodic other comprehensive (loss) income\n(2,661\n)\n(304\n)\n(2,594\n)\nBalance as of August 31, 2023\n$\n(37,340\n)\n$\n(304\n)\n$\n(2,039\n)\n$\n(39,683\n)\nReclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings, both individually and in the aggregate, were not material to the impacted captions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in all periods presented.\n87 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 12 - Revenue\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe table below illustrates the Companys revenues disaggregated by major product and sales destination (in thousands):\nYear Ended August 31,\nMajor product information:\nFerrous revenues\n$\n1,439,983\n$\n1,914,255\n$\n1,557,891\nNonferrous revenues\n781,102\n892,444\n684,862\nSteel revenues(1)\n507,550\n531,731\n379,203\nRetail and other revenues\n153,589\n147,385\n136,595\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,882,224\n$\n3,485,815\n$\n2,758,551\nRevenues based on sales destination:\nForeign\n$\n1,508,019\n$\n1,925,235\n$\n1,612,744\nDomestic\n1,374,205\n1,560,580\n1,145,807\nTotal revenues\n$\n2,882,224\n$\n3,485,815\n$\n2,758,551\n(1)Steel revenues include predominantly sales of finished steel products, in addition to sales of semi-finished goods (billets) and steel manufacturing scrap.\nIn fiscal 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Company had no external customer that accounted for more than 10% of the Companys consolidated revenues. Sales to customers located in foreign countries are a significant part of the Companys business. The schedule below identifies those foreign countries to which the Companys sales exceeded 10% of consolidated revenues in any of the last three years ended August 31 (in thousands):\n% of\nRevenue\n% of\nRevenue\n% of\nRevenue\nBangladesh\nN/A\nN/A\n$\n446,385\n%\n$\n375,668\n%\nN/A = Sales were less than the 10% threshold.\nReceivables from Contracts with Customers\nThe revenue accounting standard defines a receivable as an entitys right to consideration that is unconditional, meaning that only the passage of time is required before payment is due. As of August 31, 2023 and 2022, receivables from contracts with customers, net of an allowance for credit losses, totaled $208 million and $230 million, respectively, representing 99% and 97%, respectively, of total accounts receivable reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of each reporting date.\nContract Liabilities\nContract consideration received from a customer prior to revenue recognition is recorded as a contract liability and is recognized as revenue when the Company satisfies the related performance obligation under the terms of the contract. The Companys contract liabilities, which consist almost entirely of customer deposits for recycled metal and finished steel sales contracts reported within accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, totaled $7 million and $8 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unsatisfied performance obligations reflected in these contract liabilities relate to contracts with original expected durations of one year or less and, therefore, are not disclosed. The substantial majority of outstanding contract liabilities are reclassified to revenues within three months of the reporting date as a result of satisfying performance obligations.\nNote 13 - Employee Benefits\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries have or contribute to qualified and nonqualified retirement plans. These plans include a defined benefit pension plan, a supplemental executive retirement benefit plan (SERBP), multiemployer pension plans, defined contribution plans, and a deferred compensation plan.\n88 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Benefit Plan\nThe Company maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan for certain nonunion employees. Effective June 30, 2006, the Company froze this plan and ceased accruing further benefits for employee service. The Company reflects the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan as a net asset or liability in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in its funded status are recognized in comprehensive income. The Company amortizes as a component of net periodic pension benefit cost a portion of the net gain or loss reported within accumulated other comprehensive loss if the beginning-of-year net gain or loss exceeds 5% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets. Net periodic pension benefit cost was not material for each of the fiscal years presented in this report. The fair value of plan assets was $15 million and $16 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and the projected benefit obligation was $11 million and $12 million as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The plan was fully funded with the plan assets exceeding the projected benefit obligation by $4 million as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022. Under the fair value hierarchy, plan assets comprised Level 1 and Level 2 investments as of August 31, 2023 and 2022. Level 1 investments are valued based on quoted market prices of identical securities in the principal market. Level 2 investments are corporate bonds valued at the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. No significant contributions are expected to be made to the defined benefit pension plan in the future; however, changes in the discount rate or actual investment returns that are lower than the long-term expected return on plan assets could result in the need for the Company to make additional contributions. The assumed discount rate used to calculate the projected benefit obligation was 5.13% and 4.40% as of August 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company estimates future annual benefit payments to be between $1 million and $4 million per year.\nThe Company also has a nonqualified SERBP for certain executives. A restricted trust fund has been established with assets invested in life insurance policies that can be used for plan benefits, although the fund is subject to claims of the Companys general creditors. The trust fund is included in other assets, the current portion of the pension liability is included in other accrued liabilities, and the noncurrent portion of the pension liability is included in other long-term liabilities in the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheets. The trust fund was valued at $4 million as of each August 31, 2023 and 2022. The trust fund assets gains and losses are included in other loss, net in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Operations. The benefit obligation was $4 million as of each of August 31, 2023 and 2022. Net periodic pension benefit cost under the SERBP was not material for each of the fiscal years presented in this report.\nBecause the defined benefit pension plan and the SERBP are not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements, other disclosures required by U.S. GAAP have been omitted.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nThe Company contributes to 14 multiemployer pension plans in accordance with its collective bargaining agreements. Multiemployer pension plans are defined benefit plans sponsored by multiple employers in accordance with one or more collective bargaining agreements. The plans are jointly managed by trustees that include representatives from both management and labor unions. Contributions to the plans are made based upon a fixed rate per hour worked and are agreed to by contributing employers and the unions in collective bargaining. Benefit levels are set by a joint board of trustees based on the advice of an independent actuary regarding the level of benefits that agreed-upon contributions can be expected to support. To the extent that the pension obligation of other participating employers is unfunded, the Company may be required to make additional contributions in the future to fund these obligations.\nOne of the multiemployer plans that the Company contributes to is the Steelworkers Western Independent Shops Pension Plan (WISPP, EIN 90-0169564, Plan No. 001) benefiting the union employees of the Companys steel manufacturing operations, which are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on March 31, 2026. As of October 1, 2022, the WISPP was certified by the plans actuaries as being in the Green Zone, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Company contributed $4 million to the WISPP for each of the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021. These contributions represented more than 5% of total contributions to the WISPP for each year.\nCompany contributions to all of the multiemployer plans totaled $7 million, $7 million, and $6 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nThe Company has several defined contribution plans covering certain employees. Company contributions to the defined contribution plans totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $4 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\n89 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nIn fiscal 2021, the Company established a non-qualified deferred compensation plan (the DCP) which permits eligible employees to elect to defer receipt of compensation including salary, bonuses, and certain equity awards made under the Companys long-term incentive plan. The DCP also allows the Company to make discretionary contributions to participant accounts that may be subject to one or more vesting schedules. Participant contributions, excluding equity awards subject to vesting conditions, are fully vested at all times. The deferred compensation liability as of August 31, 2023 and 2022 was $4 million and $1 million, respectively, consisted entirely of deferred salary and bonuses, and was substantially all noncurrent and classified within other long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company maintains a rabbi trust to fund obligations under the DCP. The carrying value of assets held in the rabbi trust, which comprise company-owned life insurance policies, substantially equaled the deferred compensation liability as of both August 31, 2023 and 2022. The rabbi trust asset is classified within other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNote 14 - Share-Based Compensation\nThe Companys 1993 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the SIP), was established to provide for the grant of stock-based compensation awards to its employees, consultants, and directors. The SIP authorizes the grant of restricted shares, restricted stock units, performance-based awards including performance share awards, stock options, and stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards. The SIP is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Companys Board of Directors (Compensation Committee). There are 12.2 million shares of Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the SIP, of which 2.0 million were available for future grants as of August 31, 2023. Share-based compensation expense recognized in cost of goods sold or selling, general, and administrative expense, as applicable, was $11 million, $19 million, and $18 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs)\nDuring the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Compensation Committee granted 213,080, 160,312, and 317,760 RSUs, respectively, to the Companys key employees under the SIP. RSUs generally vest 20% per year over five years commencing October 31 of the year after grant. Each RSU entitles the recipient to receive one share of Class A common stock upon vesting.\nThe estimated fair value of an RSU is based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the date of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs granted was $31.80, $52.32, and $22.26 per unit for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The total estimated fair value of RSUs granted was $7 million, $8 million, and $7 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. For RSUs granted in each of these fiscal years, the compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards, net of forfeitures, which for participants who were retirement eligible as of the grant date or who will become retirement eligible during the five-year term of the award is the longer of two years or the period ending on the date retirement eligibility is achieved.\nA summary of the Companys RSU activity for the year ended August 31, 2023 is as follows:\nNumber of\nUnits\n(in thousands)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of August 31, 2022\n$\n26.59\nGranted\n$\n31.80\nVested\n(270\n)\n$\n25.17\nForfeited\n(42\n)\n$\n28.61\nOutstanding as of August 31, 2023\n$\n28.57\nThe total fair value of RSUs that vested, based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the vesting date, was $7 million, $15 million, and $10 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of August 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested RSUs amounted to $8 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.\n90 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPerformance Share Awards\nThe SIP authorizes performance-based awards to certain employees subject to certain conditions and restrictions. Vesting is subject to both the continued employment of the participant with the Company and the achievement of certain performance goals established by the Compensation Committee. A participant generally must be employed by the Company on October 31 following the end of the performance period to receive an award payout. However, adjusted awards are paid if employment terminates earlier on account of a qualifying employment termination event such as death, disability, retirement, termination without cause after the first year of the performance period, or a sale of the Company.\nIn recent years, the performance share awards have comprised two separate and distinct awards with different vesting conditions. Awards vest if the threshold level under the specified metric is met at the end of the approximately three-year performance period. For awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022, the performance metrics are the Companys recycled metal volume growth and its return on capital employed (ROCE). Award share payouts depend on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved, which performance-based payout factors are adjusted by a total shareholder return (TSR) modifier based on the Companys average TSR percentile rank relative to a designated peer group. The number of shares that a participant receives is equal to the number of performance shares granted multiplied by an initial payout factor based on recycled metal volume growth and ROCE, which ranges from a threshold of 50% to a maximum of 200%. The final payout factor is then determined by applying the TSR modifier to the initial payout factor within a certain range, with a maximum increase or decrease of 20%.\nFor awards granted in fiscal 2021, the performance metrics are the Companys TSR relative to a designated peer group and the Companys ROCE. Award share payouts depend on the extent to which the performance goals have been achieved. The number of shares that a participant receives is equal to the award granted multiplied by a payout factor, which ranges from a threshold of 50% to a maximum of 200%. The TSR awards granted in fiscal 2021 stipulate certain limitations to the payout in the event the payout reaches a defined ceiling level or the Companys TSR is negative.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of performance share awards with a TSR market condition using a Monte-Carlo simulation model utilizing several key assumptions, including the following for such awards granted during the years ended August 31:\nExpected share price volatility (Radius)\n56.1\n%\n51.6\n%\n48.5\n%\nExpected share price volatility (Peer group)\n60.5\n%\n58.5\n%\n54.9\n%\nExpected correlation to peer group companies\n48.1\n%\n46.0\n%\n44.5\n%\nRisk-free rate of return\n4.16\n%\n0.61\n%\n0.23\n%\nThe fair value of the ROCE awards granted in fiscal 2021, which awards do not have a TSR market condition, is based on the market closing price of the underlying Class A common stock on the grant date.\nAll the performance share awards granted in fiscal 2023 and 2022 have a non-market performance condition (either recycled metal volume growth or ROCE) in addition to a market condition (TSR modifier), and the ROCE awards granted in fiscal 2021 have only a non-market performance condition. The Company accrues compensation cost for these performance share awards based on the probable outcome of achieving the specified performance conditions, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period (or to the date a qualifying employment termination event entitles the recipient to a prorated award, if before the end of the service period). The Company reassesses whether achievement of the performance conditions is probable at each reporting date. If it is probable that the actual performance results will exceed the stated target performance conditions, the Company accrues additional compensation cost for the additional performance shares to be awarded. If, upon reassessment, it is no longer probable that the actual performance results will exceed the stated target performance conditions, or that it is no longer probable that the target performance conditions will be achieved, the Company reverses any recognized compensation cost for shares no longer probable of being issued. If the performance conditions are not achieved at the end of the performance period, all related compensation cost previously recognized is reversed.\nThe compensation cost for the TSR awards granted in fiscal 2021 based on the grant-date fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, is recognized over the requisite service period (or to the date a qualifying employment termination event entitles the recipient to a prorated award, if before the end of the service period), regardless of whether the market condition has been or will be satisfied.\nDuring the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, the Compensation Committee granted a total of 211,046 (105,523 recycled metal volume growth with TSR modifier and 105,523 ROCE with TSR modifier), 153,080 (76,540 recycled metal volume growth with TSR modifier and 76,540 ROCE with TSR modifier), and 316,649 (157,791 TSR and 158,858 ROCE) performance share awards,\n91 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrespectively. The weighted average grant date fair value per share of performance share awards granted was $32.10, $54.29, and $22.33 for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nA summary of the Companys performance-based awards activity for the year ended August 31, 2023 is as follows:\nNumber of\nAwards\n(in thousands)\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of August 31, 2022\n$\n28.16\nGranted\n$\n32.10\nPerformance achievement(1)\n$\n20.98\nVested\n(487\n)\n$\n21.20\nForfeited\n(50\n)\n$\n34.20\nOutstanding as of August 31, 2023\n$\n32.44\n(1)Reflects the net number of awards achieved above target levels based on actual performance measured at the end of the performance period.\nThe total fair value of performance share awards which vested, based on the market closing price of the Companys Class A common stock on the vesting date, was $13 million, $14 million, and $7 million for the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. As of August 31, 2023, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested performance share awards amounted to $4 million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years.\nDeferred Stock Units (DSUs)\nThe Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors (DSU Plan) provides for the issuance of DSUs to non-employee directors to be granted under the DSU Plan. Each DSU gives the director the right to receive one share of Class A common stock at a future date. Immediately following the annual meeting of shareholders, each non-employee director receives DSUs which become fully vested on the day before the next annual meeting, subject to continued service on the Board. The compensation cost associated with the DSUs granted is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards.\nThe Company issues Class A common stock to a director pursuant to vested DSUs in a lump sum in January of the first year after the director ceases to be a director of the Company, subject to the right of the director to elect an installment payment program under the DSU Plan.\nDSUs with vesting conditions granted during the years ended August 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 totaled 21,438 units, 20,876 units, and 28,042 units, respectively. The compensation cost associated with DSUs and the total value of shares vested during each of these fiscal years, as well as the unrecognized compensation cost as of August 31, 2023, were not material.\nNote 15 - Derivative Financial Instruments\nInterest Rate Swaps\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its debt and may enter interest rate swap contracts to effectively manage the impact of interest rate changes on its outstanding debt, which has predominantly floating interest rates. The Company does not enter interest rate swap transactions for trading or speculative purposes.\nDuring the fiscal year ended August 31, 2023, the Company entered three pay-fixed interest rate swap transactions, each with a different major financial institution counterparty and designated as a cash flow hedge, to hedge the variability in interest cash flows associated with the Companys variable-rate loans under its bank revolving credit facilities. The interest rate swaps involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from the counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amount. These contracts mature in August 2026. As of August 31, 2023, the total notional amount of these interest rate swaps was $150 million. The fair values of the interest rate swaps are based upon inputs corroborated by observable market data which is considered Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe fair value of derivative instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of August 31, 2023 is as follows (in thousands):\n92 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAsset (Liability) Derivatives\nBalance Sheet Location\nAugust 31, 2023\nInterest rate swap contracts\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n$\n1,163\nInterest rate swap contracts\nOther long-term liabilities\n(1,555\n)\nSee Note 11 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss for tabular presentation of the effects of interest rate swap derivative cash flow hedges on other comprehensive income. All related cash flow hedge amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) were recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended August 31, 2023, which reclassified amounts totaled less than $1 million. Total interest expense was $19 million for the year ended August 31, 2023. There was no hedge ineffectiveness with respect to the Companys interest rate swap cash flow hedges for the year ended August 31, 2023.\nNote 16 - Income Taxes\n(Loss) income from continuing operations before income taxes was as follows for the years ended August 31 (in thousands):\nUnited States\n$\n(32,541\n)\n$\n204,150\n$\n195,037\nForeign\n4,465\n12,526\n12,952\nTotal\n$\n(28,076\n)\n$\n216,676\n$\n207,989\nIncome tax (benefit) expense from continuing operations consisted of the following for the years ended August 31 (in thousands):\nCurrent:\nFederal\n$\n(377\n)\n$\n18,114\n$\n27,244\nState\n1,392\n3,811\nForeign\n(4\n)\nTotal current tax expense\n1,187\n19,545\n31,051\nDeferred:\nFederal\n(4,198\n)\n21,771\n6,939\nState\n(686\n)\n(547\n)\nForeign\n2,501\nTotal deferred tax (benefit) expense\n(3,934\n)\n25,052\n6,884\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense\n$\n(2,747\n)\n$\n44,597\n$\n37,935\n93 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA reconciliation of the difference between the federal statutory rate and the Companys effective tax rate for the years ended August 31 is as follows:\nFederal statutory rate\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nState taxes, net of credits\n5.0\n1.6\n1.4\nForeign income taxed at different rates\n(1.2\n)\n-\n(0.5\n)\nValuation allowance on deferred tax assets\n(6.1\n)\n0.4\n(1.0\n)\nFederal rate change\n-\n-\n0.4\nNon-deductible officers compensation\n(7.8\n)\n2.5\n1.2\nOther non-deductible expenses\n(1.6\n)\n0.3\n0.4\nNoncontrolling interests\n0.3\n(0.3\n)\n(0.5\n)\nResearch and development credits\n6.4\n(0.9\n)\n(1.5\n)\nTax return to provision adjustment\n(1.2\n)\n(2.4\n)\n-\nUnrecognized tax benefits\n(8.5\n)\n1.2\n0.9\nInterest income\n1.4\n(0.1\n)\n(0.1\n)\nExcess tax benefit from stock-based compensation\n3.2\n(1.6\n)\n(0.2\n)\nForeign derived intangible income\n-\n(1.0\n)\n(2.5\n)\nOther\n(1.1\n)\n(0.1\n)\n(0.8\n)\nEffective tax rate\n9.8\n%\n20.6\n%\n18.2\n%\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was a benefit on pre-tax loss of 9.8%, compared to an expense on pre-tax income of 20.6% and 18.2% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Companys effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the aggregate effect of the relatively low absolute level of pre-tax earnings, permanent differences from non-deductible expenses, and unrecognized tax benefits. The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2022 approximated the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%, reflecting tax benefits from vesting of share-based awards, the foreign derived intangible income (FDII) deduction, and research and development credits, offset by the aggregate impact of state taxes and permanent differences from non-deductible expenses. The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2021 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the benefit from the FDII deduction, the impact of research and development credits, and the release of the valuation allowance against Puerto Rico deferred tax assets.\nInflation Reduction Act\nOn August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law, which included the introduction of a new 15% Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT), as well as a 1% excise tax on corporate share repurchases. The Company does not meet the threshold to be subject to the CAMT, and there were no other impacts of the IRA to the Company in fiscal 2023 or 2022.\n94 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities comprised the following as of August 31 (in thousands):\nDeferred tax assets:\nOperating lease liabilities\n$\n17,605\n$\n17,901\nAmortizable goodwill and other intangibles\n13,488\n9,914\nEmployee benefit accruals\n8,772\n12,241\nNet operating loss carryforwards\n20,280\n7,499\nEnvironmental liabilities\n10,109\n9,742\nOther contingencies\n5,579\n5,199\nState credit carryforwards\n7,711\n7,212\nInventory valuation methods\n2,508\n2,749\nOther\n7,193\n3,687\nValuation allowances\n(17,042\n)\n(15,342\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\n76,203\n60,802\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nAccelerated depreciation and other basis differences\n61,938\n60,539\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n17,573\n17,353\nInvestment in operating partnerships\n25,769\n15,553\nPrepaid expense acceleration and other\n6,827\n6,087\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n112,107\n99,532\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n(35,904\n)\n$\n(38,730\n)\nAs of August 31, 2023, deferred tax assets related to U.S. federal operating loss carryforwards were $11 million with no expiration period, and deferred tax assets related to state operating loss carryforwards were $9 million, the majority of which had a valuation allowance. State operating loss carryforwards will expire if not used in various years beginning in 2023. State credit carryforwards will expire if not used between 2023 and 2037.\nValuation Allowances\nThe Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis through an analysis of potential sources of future taxable income, including prior year taxable income available to absorb a carryback of tax losses, reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies, and forecasts of taxable income. The Company considers all negative and positive evidence, including the weight of the evidence, to determine if valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are required. In fiscal 2021, the Company released the valuation allowance against its Puerto Rican deferred tax assets resulting in a discrete tax benefit of $2 million. The release of this valuation allowance was the result of sufficient positive evidence at the time, including cumulative income in the Companys Puerto Rico tax jurisdiction in recent years and projections of future taxable income based primarily on the Company's improved financial performance, that it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. The Company continues to maintain valuation allowances against certain state and Canadian deferred tax assets. Canadian deferred tax assets against which the Company continues to maintain a valuation allowance relate to indefinite-lived assets.\nAccounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the Companys reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended August 31 (in thousands):\nUnrecognized tax benefits, as of the beginning of the year\n$\n10,326\n$\n8,320\n$\n7,456\nAdditions (reductions) for tax positions of prior years\n1,055\n(574\n)\nAdditions for tax positions of the current year\n1,223\n1,486\nReductions for lapse of statutes\n-\n(23\n)\n(48\n)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, as of the end of the year\n$\n11,830\n$\n10,326\n$\n8,320\n95 / Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. dba Radius Recycling Form 10-K Fiscal 2023\nSCHNITZER STEEL INDUSTRIES, INC. dba RADIUS RECYCLING\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company anticipates an immaterial impact on earnings from releases from the reserve in the next 12 months.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Companys management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has completed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. Consistent with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of the internal controls of the ScrapSource business, which the Company acquired on November 18, 2022, from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures. The ScrapSource business represented less than 2% of consolidated total assets and less than 1% of consolidated total revenues as of and for the year ended August 31, 2023. Based on this evaluation, the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of August 31, 2023, the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting is presented within Part II, Item 8 of this report and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change in the Companys internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during its most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companys internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended August 31, 2023, none of the Company's directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), adopted, terminated, or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended).\nITEM 9C.
