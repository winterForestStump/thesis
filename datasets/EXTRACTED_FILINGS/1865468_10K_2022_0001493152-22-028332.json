    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nGeneral\nKairous Acquisition Corp. Limited (the Company) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 24, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region, although the Company intends to focus on opportunities in Asia (excluding China). We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).\nOn December 16, 2021, the Company consummated the initial public offering (IPO) of 7,800,000 units (the Units), which includes the partial exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option of 300,000 Units. Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (Ordinary Share), one-half of one warrant (Warrant), with a whole warrant entitling its holder to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $78,000,000.\nOn December 16, 2021, simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (Private Placement) with our sponsor, Kairous Asia Limited (the Sponsor), of 357,143 units (the Private Units) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,571,430. The Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. The holders of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the private shares underlying the Private Units (the Private Shares) and any public shares acquired by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Companys pre-business combination activities prior to the consummation of a business combination unless the Company offers holders of IPO shares the right to receive their pro rata portion of the funds then held in the trust account, (C) not to convert any Private Shares for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity and (D) that the Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. Our Sponsor has also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the insider shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of our initial business combination.\nA total of $78,780,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option Units) and the Private Placements on December 16, 2021 were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Companys public shareholders at Citibank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, acting as trustee. None of the funds held in trust will be released from the trust account, other than interest income to pay any tax obligations, until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination within the required time period or our entry into liquidation if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. On January 21, 2022, our ordinary shares, warrants and rights underlying the Units sold in our IPO began to trade separately on a voluntary basis.\nSince our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates. The outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide, and potential target companies may defer or end discussions for a potential business combination with us whether or not COVID-19 affects their business operations. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\nCompetitive strengths\nWe believe our specific competitive strengths to be the following:\nExperienced Management Team with Proven Track Record\nOur management team has a proven track record of successfully managing investments and generating an attractive return for investors. Mr. Joseph Lee, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, has extensive experience in private equity and venture capital investment while Mr. Philip Wong, our Chief Financial Officer has more than 25 years of entrepreneurship experience including over 23 years of investment experience across the Asia Pacific region. In particular, Mr. Joseph Lee is the founder of Kairous Capital, a regional venture capital firm focusing on technology investments across China and Southeast Asia. Kairous Capital is one of the very few venture capital firms that invests in both China and Southeast Asia, seeking to seize arbitrage opportunities that arise due to technological differences between the two regions. Mr. Joseph Lee has successfully invested in more than 25 companies and exited many of them through trade sales and initial public offering in London Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange. Apart from China, he has personally involved in investments in Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines. Both our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are considered cross-border specialists having significant business and investment experiences in cross-border ventures.\nStrong Deal Sourcing Capability\nWe believe our regional footprint has given us a strong deal sourcing capability. Mr. Joseph Lee started Kairous Capital, a regional venture capital firm with offices in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Malaysia. Kairous Capitals team is comprised of 15 individuals located in Southeast Asia, Hong Kong and China. To date, Kairous Capital has invested in 13 companies in China and across Southeast Asia, out of over 700 investment deals that were presented to Kairous Capital.\nTogether with our management team, we believe we have a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that make us efficient at sourcing the best deal for a business combination in order to attempt to bring maximum returns for our investors.\nRegional Coverage with Local Expertise\nAs the founder, Mr. Joseph Lee has led Kairous Capital to be one of the prominent regional venture capital firms in Southeast Asia. Kairous Capital is the only venture capital firm in the Asia region with regulated entities in Hong Kong and Malaysia. This shows that Kairous Capitals investment expertise is recognized by some of the most prestigious financial markets globally, and our local presence allows us to have in-depth understanding on the local and regulatory landscape.\nWe believe that Kairous Capitals active involvement and value creation investment methodology are also key strengths in attracting high quality targets. Our ability to expedite the growth in the region by cross-border expansion, transfer of know-how and talents between the regions, deep dive in the different respective markets in China and Southeast Asia has always been one of the key values sought by our partners and investees.\nBy leveraging our management teams unique regional investment experience, local expertise, world-class processes, cautious downside protection, and providing post-acquisition value-add capabilities, we believe that we will be able to acquire a target business that will achieve significant returns for investors.\nStatus as a Publicly Listed Company\nWe believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering. We believe that target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional initial public offering. During an initial public offering, there are typically expenses incurred in marketing, which would be costlier than a business combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our shareholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with shareholders interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.\nStrong Financial Position and Flexibility\nWith the funds held in our trust account, we can offer a target business a variety of options to facilitate a business combination and fund future expansion and growth of its business. Because we are able to consummate a business combination using the cash proceeds from the IPO and Private Placement, our share capital, debt or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use an efficient structure allowing us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to address the needs of the parties. However, if a business combination requires us to use substantially all of our cash to pay for the purchase price, we may need to arrange third party financing to help fund our business combination. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing.\nAcquisition Strategy\nOur acquisition strategy will seek to capitalize on our M&A and operational expertise as well as the relationships of our management team and our board of directors, to identify attractive businesses that have the capacity to grow rapidly by utilizing a public vehicle. Although we are not limited to any particular industry, we intend to primarily focus on fast-growing technology companies in different industry verticals, including but not limited to e-commerce, financial technology, insurance technology, digital health, digital media and digital services. There is no restriction as to the geographic location of targets that we can pursue, although we intend to initially prioritize geographic locations in Asia (excluding China), as our officers and directors consist of successful entrepreneurs and senior executives with decades of operating and M&A experiences in this region. We shall not undertake our initial business combination with any entity with its principal business operations in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).\nSoutheast Asia has been exhibiting high economic growth with GDP growth expected at 5% per annum through 2025. With a population of over 674 million people and a median age of 30 years old (Worldometers, 2021), the region represents the fifth-largest economy in the world with tremendous growth potential as the younger population grows to become the main consumption driver. In 2020, the Southeast Asian region had approximately 400 million Internet users, with 90% of them being mobile phone users. On average, internet users in the region spend 4.3 hours per day on the mobile Internet, indicative of the rise of the digital economy across the region (e-Company SEA Report by Google, Temasek and Bain & Company, 2020).\nAlthough we will not target to consummate a business combination with a Chinese company or a company with major operations in China, the successes of some of the technology companies in China can provide some guidance for investors looking to invest in companies in similar industries in Southeast Asia. Investment firms with a regional presence, local offices and understanding of the market will have the advantage of implementing this unique investment strategy and, we believe, bring significant returns to our investors.\nAcquisition Criteria\nThe focus of our management team is to create shareholder value by leveraging its experience to improve the efficiency of the business while implementing strategies to grow revenue and profits organically and/or through acquisitions. Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While we intend to use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating prospective businesses, we may deviate from these criteria and guidelines should we see fit to do so:\n\u25cf Niche Deal Size\nWe intend to acquire companies with enterprise values of between $120 million and $300 million and with revenue or net profit at an annual growth rate of at least 50%. We believe we have greater access to companies within this range and the negotiation process is generally less time consuming than with companies that are much larger.\n\u25cf Proven Business Model in Developed Markets\nWe intend to acquire companies with business models that are well proven in developed markets. Asia is growing at an unprecedented speed and we believe the region is in need of faster and more efficient business models, similar to those we see in developed countries such as United States and China that are well proven to be much better in serving the market and recorded strong growth trajectory. For example, in the United States, there are companies like Thrasio and Perch which focus on improving the efficiency of the eCommerce value chain. In China, there are companies like Baozun and Lily & Beauty which share similar aspirations to those of its US counterparts. We believe such business models have high potential to work in emerging markets in Asia (excluding China).\n\u25cf Long-term Revenue Visibility with Defensible Market Position\nWe intend to seek target companies that are at an inflection point, such as those who achieved product-market fit and are growing at an exponential rate, requiring additional management expertise, are able to innovate by developing new products or services, or where we believe we can drive improved financial performance and where an acquisition by us may help facilitate growth.\n\u25cf Benefits from Being a U.S. Public Company (Value Creation and Marketing Opportunities)\nWe intend to seek target companies that should offer attractive risk-adjusted equity returns for our shareholders. We intend to seek to acquire a target on terms and in a manner that leverages our experience. We expect to evaluate financial returns based on (i) the potential for organic growth in cash flows, (ii) the ability to achieve cost savings, (iii) the ability to accelerate growth, including through the opportunity for follow-on acquisitions and (iv) the prospects for creating value through other value-creation initiatives. Potential upside from growth in the target business earnings and an improved capital structure will be weighed against any identified downside risks.\nThese criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.\nOther Acquisition Considerations\nWe are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent firm that commonly renders valuation opinions for the type of company we are seeking to acquire or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.\nEffecting a Business Combination\nGeneral\nWe intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement of private units, our share capital, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. Although substantially all of the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private Placement are intended to be applied generally toward effecting a business combination as described in this Form 10-K, the proceeds are not otherwise being designated for any more specific purposes. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various U.S. Federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.\nSources of Target Businesses\nWe anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as their respective affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arms length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination (regardless of the type of transaction). If we decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our officers, directors or initial shareholders, we will do so only if we have obtained an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. However, as of the date of this Form 10-K, there is no affiliated entity that we consider a business combination target.\nSelection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination\nSubject to the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any other specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:\n\u25cf financial condition and results of operation;\n\u25cf growth potential;\n\u25cf experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;\n\u25cf capital requirements;\n\u25cf competitive position;\n\u25cf barriers to entry;\n\u25cf stage of development of its products, processes or services;\n\u25cf degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;\n\u25cf proprietary features and degree of intellectual property or other protection for its products, processes or services;\n\u25cf regulatory environment of the industry; and\n\u25cf costs associated with effecting the business combination.\nWe believe such factors will be important in evaluating prospective target businesses, regardless of the location or industry in which such target business operates. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Furthermore, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.\nAny evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.\nThe time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.\nFair Market Value of Target Business\nPursuant to Nasdaq listing rules, the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting discounts and taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, although we may acquire a target business whose fair market value significantly exceeds 80% of the trust account balance. We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure a business combination where we merge directly with the target business or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, only the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test, assuming that we obtain and maintain a listing for our securities on NASDAQ. In order to consummate such an acquisition, we may issue a significant amount of our debt or equity securities to the sellers of such businesses and/or seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities. Since we have no specific business combination under consideration, we have not entered into any such fund raising arrangement and have no current intention of doing so. The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions on the type of target business we are seeking to acquire, as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.\nWe will not be required to comply with the 80% fair market value requirement if we are delisted from NASDAQ. If NASDAQ delists our securities from trading on its exchange, we would not be required to satisfy the fair market value requirement described above and could complete a business combination with a target business having a fair market value substantially below 80% of the balance in the trust account.\nLack of Business Diversification\nOur business combination must be with a target business or businesses that collectively satisfy the minimum valuation standard at the time of such acquisition, as discussed above, although this process may entail the simultaneous acquisitions of several operating businesses at the same time. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:\n\u25cf subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and\n\u25cf result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.\nIf we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.\nLimited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business Management\nAlthough we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, our officers and directors may not have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.\nFollowing a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.\nShareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination\nIn connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable and deferred underwriting fees) or (2) provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their public shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable and deferred underwriting fees), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender any or all of his, her or its public shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction, or whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we so choose and we are legally permitted to do so, we have the flexibility to avoid a shareholder vote and allow our shareholders to sell their shares pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act which regulate issuer tender offers. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SECs proxy rules. We will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 upon such consummation and, solely if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination.\nWe chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, our net tangible asset threshold may limit our ability to consummate such initial business combination (as we may be required to have a lesser number of shares converted or sold to us) and may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait 12 months from the closing of the IPO (or up to 21 months if we have extended the period of time) in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.\nOur initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.\nHowever, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination, our officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a companys stock.\nAbility to Extend Time to Complete Business Combination\nIf we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination three times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for each three month extension $780,000, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lenders discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. Any notes issued pursuant to these loans would be in addition to any notes issued pursuant to working capital loans made to us.\nConversion/Tender Rights\nAt any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their public shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our initial shareholders have agreed, pursuant to written letter agreements with us, not to convert any public shares held by them into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account. The conversion rights will be effected under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and Cayman Islands law as redemptions. If we hold a meeting to approve an initial business combination, a holder will always have the ability to vote against a proposed business combination and not seek conversion of his shares.\nAlternatively, if we engage in a tender offer, each public shareholder will be provided the opportunity to sell his public shares to us in such tender offer. The tender offer rules require us to hold the tender offer open for at least 20 business days. Accordingly, this is the minimum amount of time we would need to provide holders to determine whether they want to sell their public shares to us in the tender offer or remain an investor in our company.\nOur initial shareholders, officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the IPO or purchased by them in the IPO or in the aftermarket.\nWe may also require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in street name, to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Companys DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holders option, at any time at or prior to the vote on the business combination. Once the shares are converted by the holder, and effectively redeemed by us under Cayman Islands law, the transfer agent will then update our Register of Members to reflect all conversions. The proxy solicitation materials that we will furnish to shareholders in connection with the vote for any proposed business combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time our proxy statement is mailed through the vote on the business combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. Under our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, we are required to provide at least 10 days advance notice of any shareholder meeting, which would be the minimum amount of time a shareholder would have to determine whether to exercise conversion rights. As a result, if we require public shareholders who wish to convert their ordinary shares into the right to receive a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account to comply with the foregoing delivery requirements, holders may not have sufficient time to receive the notice and deliver their shares for conversion. Accordingly, investors may not be able to exercise their conversion rights and may be forced to retain our securities when they otherwise would not want to.\nThere is a nominal cost associated with this tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker $45 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the converting holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights to deliver their shares prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated, this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.\nAny request to convert or tender such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion or tender and subsequently decides prior to the vote on the business combination or the expiration of the tender offer not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).\nIf the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion or tender rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.\nRedemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if No Business Combination\nIf we do not complete a business combination within 12 months (or up to 21 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination as described in this Form 10-K) from the consummation of the IPO, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible, but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $50,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 12 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination three times by an additional three months each time (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company on the date of this Form 10-K, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial business combination, our insiders or their affiliates or designees, upon five days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account for each three month extension $780,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full, on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline. The insiders will receive a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note equal to the amount of any such deposit that will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a business combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, or, at the lenders discretion, converted upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders will have approved the issuance of the private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. In the event that we receive notice from our insiders five days prior to the applicable deadline of their intent to effect an extension, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds had been timely deposited. Our insiders and their affiliates or designees are not obligated to fund the trust account to extend the time for us to complete our initial business combination. To the extent that some, but not all, of our insiders, decide to extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination, such insiders (or their affiliates or designees) may deposit the entire amount required. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such time period, we will, as promptly as possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of our outstanding public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the trust account, including a pro rata portion of any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not necessary to pay our taxes, then seek to liquidate and dissolve. However, we may not be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public shareholders. In the event of our liquidation and subsequent dissolution, the public rights will expire and will be worthless.\nThe amount in the trust account under the Companies Act will be treated as funds distributable under the Companies Act provided that immediately following the date on which the proposed distribution is proposed to be made, we are able to pay our debts as they fall due in the ordinary course of business. If we are forced to liquidate the trust account, we anticipate that we would distribute to our public shareholders the amount in the trust account calculated as of the date that is two days prior to the distribution date (including any accrued interest). Prior to such distribution, we would be required to assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us by our creditors for amounts they are actually owed and make provision for such amounts, as creditors take priority over our public shareholders with respect to amounts that are owed to them. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our shareholders could potentially be liable for any claims of creditors to the extent of distributions received by them as an unlawful payment in the event we enter an insolvent liquidation. Furthermore, while we will seek to have all vendors and service providers (which would include any third parties we engaged to assist us in any way in connection with our search for a target business) and prospective target businesses execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if such entities execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account or that a court would conclude that such agreements are legally enforceable.\nEach of our initial shareholders and our officers and directors have agreed to waive its rights to participate in any liquidation of our trust account or other assets with respect to the insider shares and private units and to vote their insider shares, private shares in favor of any liquidation and plan of distribution which we submit to a vote of shareholders. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants or rights, which will expire worthless.\nIf we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the IPO, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share distribution from the trust account would be $10.10.\nThe proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would be prior to the claims of our public shareholders. Although we will seek to have all vendors, including lenders for money borrowed, prospective target businesses or other entities we engage execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including but not limited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refused to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, we would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to us if we chose not to engage such third party and evaluate if such engagement would be in the best interest of our shareholders if such third party refused to waive such claims. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refused to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a provider of required services willing to provide the waiver. In any event, our management would perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and would only enter into an agreement with a third party that did not execute a waiver if management believed that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason.\nThe sponsor has agreed that, if we liquidate the trust account prior to the consummation of a business combination, it will be liable to pay debts and obligations to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us in excess of the net proceeds of the IPO and Private Placement not held in the trust account, but only to the extent necessary to ensure that such debts or obligations do not reduce the amounts in the trust account and only if such parties have not executed a waiver agreement. However, we cannot assure you that they will be able to satisfy those obligations if they are required to do so. Accordingly, the actual per-share distribution could be less than $10.10 due to claims of creditors.\nCompetition\nIn identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the IPO and Private Placement, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.\nThe following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:\n\u25cf our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a business combination or obtain the necessary financial information to be sent to shareholders in connection with such business combination may delay or prevent the completion of a transaction;\n\u25cf our obligation to convert public shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination;\n\u25cf NASDAQ may require us to file a new listing application and meet its initial listing requirements to maintain the listing of our securities following a business combination;\n\u25cf our outstanding warrants, rights and unit purchase option and the potential future dilution they represent;\n\u25cf our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting discounts to Maxim Group LLC upon consummation of our initial business combination;\n\u25cf our obligation to either repay or issue units upon conversion of up to $1,000,000 of working capital loans that may be made to us by our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates;\n\u25cf our obligation to register the resale of the insider shares, as well as the private units (and underlying securities) and any securities issued to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates upon conversion of working capital loans; and\n\u25cf the impact on the target business assets as a result of unknown liabilities under the securities laws or otherwise depending on developments involving us prior to the consummation of a business combination.\nAny of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.\nIf we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.\nFacilities\nWe maintain our principal executive office at Unit 9-3, Oval Tower @ Damansara, No. 685, Jalan Damansara, 60000 Taman Tun Dr. Ismail, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.\nEmployees\nWe have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for the business combination and the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once management locates a suitable target business to acquire, they will spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time to our affairs) than they would prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business (which could range from only a few hours a week while we are trying to locate a potential target business to a majority of their time as we move into serious negotiations with a target business for a business combination). We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAs a smaller reporting company we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNot applicable. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nWe do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operations. We maintain our principal executive offices at Unit 9-3, Oval Tower @ Damansara, No. 685, Jalan Damansara, 60000 Taman Tun Dr. Ismail, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe may be subject to legal proceedings, investigations and claims incidental to the conduct of our business from time to time. We are not currently a party to any material litigation or other legal proceedings brought against us. We are also not aware of any legal proceeding, investigation or claim, or other legal exposure that has a more than remote possibility of having a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot Applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED SHAREHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nOur units began to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol KACLU on December 14, 2021. The ordinary shares, warrants and rights comprising the units began separate trading on Nasdaq on January 21, 2022, under the symbols KACL, KACLW and KACLR, respectively.\nHolders of Record\nAs of October 13, 2022, there were 8,920,521 of our ordinary shares issued and outstanding held by nine shareholders of record. The number of record holders was determined from the records of our transfer agent and does not include beneficial owners of ordinary shares whose shares are held in the names of various security brokers, dealers, and registered clearing agencies.\nDividends\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our ordinary shares to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of an initial business combination. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings, if any, capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination. The payment of any dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time. It is the present intention of our board of directors to retain all earnings, if any, for use in our business operations and, accordingly, our board of directors does not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any share dividends in the foreseeable future. Further, if we incur any indebtedness, our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nNone.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nOn December 16, 2021, the Company consummated its IPO of 7,800,000 Units (including the issuance of 300,000 Units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of the over-allotment option). Each Unit consists of one Ordinary Share, one-half of one Warrant, with a whole Warrant entitling its holder to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one Right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $78,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the Private Placement of 357,143 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,571,430. A total of $78,780,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the Private Placements on December 16, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Companys public shareholders. The Company issued 39,000 ordinary shares of the Company to the representative of the underwriter (the Representative Shares) for services related to the Initial Public Offering. The Representative Shares have a grant date fair value of $341,230.\nUse of Proceeds\nOn December 16, 2021, the Company consummated its initial public offering (IPO) of 7,800,000 units (the Units) (including the issuance of 300,000 Units as a result of the underwriters partial exercise of the over-allotment option). Each Unit consists of one ordinary share (Ordinary Share), one-half of one warrant (Warrant) entitling its holder to purchase one Ordinary Share at a price of $11.50 per whole share, and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an Ordinary Share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $78,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated a private placement (Private Placement) of 357,143 units (the Private Units) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $3,571,430. A total of $78,780,000 of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the IPO (including the over-allotment option units) and the Private Placements on December 16, 2021, were placed in a trust account established for the benefit of the Companys public shareholders.\nThe Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO except with respect to certain registration rights and transfer restrictions. The holders of the Private Units have agreed (A) to vote the private shares underlying the Private Units (the Private Shares) and any public shares acquired by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (B) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment to the Companys Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with respect to the Companys pre-business combination activities prior to the consummation of a business combination unless the Company offers holders of IPO shares the right to receive their pro rata portion of the funds then held in the trust account, (C) not to convert any Private Shares for cash from the trust account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to shareholders rights or pre-business combination activity and (D) that the Private Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distribution upon winding up if a business combination is not consummated. Our sponsor has also agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the insider shares and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the insider shares must agree to, each as described above) until the completion of our initial business combination.\nWe paid a total of $1,560,000, in underwriting discounts and commissions (not including the 3.5% deferred underwriting commission payable at the consummation of initial business combination) and $552,288 for other costs and expenses related to our formation and the IPO.\nFor a description of the use of the proceeds generated in our initial public offering, see below Part II, Item 7 - Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nNone. ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nOverview\nWe are a blank check company, incorporated on March 24, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company. We were incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report as our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering) and the private placement of the Private Placement Units (as defined below), the sale of certain forward purchase securities, our shares (other backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), securities, debt or a combination of cash, equity and debt.\nResults of Operations\nWe have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any operating revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2022 have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering and, after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, we had a net loss of $85,168, which resulted from operating costs of $199,714 partially offset by interest income on the operating account and the investments held in a trust account (the Trust Account) in the amount of $114,546.\nFor the period from March 24, 2021 through June 30, 2021, we had a net loss of $6,305, which resulted from operating costs of $6,305.\nGoing Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn December 16, 2021, we consummated an Initial Public Offering of 7,800,000 Units (the Units) generating gross proceeds to the Company of $78,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement) of an aggregate of 357,143 Units (the Private Placement Units) to Kairous Asia Limited (the Sponsor) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Units, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $3,571,430.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities was $265,213, which was due to net loss of $85,168 and interest income on investments held in the Trust Account of $114,512, as well as changes in operating assets and liabilities of $65,533.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used in investing activities was $78,780,000, which was the result of the amount of net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Units being deposited to the Trust Account.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022 of $79,528,178 was comprised of $76,440,100 from the issuance of Units in the Initial Public Offering net of underwriters discount paid, $3,571,430 in proceeds from the issuance of the Private Placement Units to our Sponsor and proceeds from the issuance of a promissory note to our Sponsor of $70,000, partially offset by the payment of $553,352 for other offering costs associated with the Initial Public Offering.\nFor the period March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, net cash used in operating activities was $0, which was due to net loss of $6,305 offset by formation and organization costs paid by related parties of $6,305.\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had cash of $482,965 held outside the Trust Account. The Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the Company will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had insufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $471,831 and cash of $482,965. The Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit and has not generated cash from operations to support its ongoing business plan. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it pursues an initial business combination target.\nIn connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that hits history of losses and insufficient liquidity raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the IPO (less than 12 months within filing of these financial statements), the Company is required to cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nContractual Obligations\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Units, shares being issued to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, and units that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions, which the underwriter partially exercised the over-allotment, and the additional 300,000 Units were issued on December 16, 2021.\nThe underwriter was paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $1,559,900 in the aggregate. In addition, the underwriter is entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $2,730,000 in the aggregate. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriter from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a business combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:\nOrdinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption\nAll of the 7,800,000 ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Companys liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with a business combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Companys Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. In accordance with SEC and its staffs guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require ordinary shares subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Therefore, all ordinary shares have been classified outside of permanent equity.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital and accumulated deficit.\nNet Loss Per Ordinary Share\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2022. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, we were not subject to any market or interest rate risk. Following the consummation of our IPO, the net proceeds of our IPO, including amounts in deposited in the trust account, was invested in U.S. government treasury bills, notes or bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less, or in certain money market funds that invest solely in U.S. treasuries. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe there will be no associated material exposure to interest rate risk when and if the net proceeds are invested in such securities. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nOur consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto begin on page of this Annual Report. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2022, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of June 30, 2022, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\nManagements Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting\nAs required by SEC rules and regulations implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15- d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of our company,\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and\n(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect errors or misstatements in our financial statements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree or compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In making these assessments, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessments and those criteria, management determined that internal controls over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022 were effective.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include an attestation report of internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm due to our status as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nNone.\nITEM 9C. DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNone.\nPART III ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe following table sets forth information about our directors and executive officers as of October 11, 2022.\nName\nAge\nPosition\nJoseph Lee Moh Hon\nDirector, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman\nPhilip Wong Cheung Wang\nChief Financial Officer\nSteve Hsia Hsien-Chieng\nIndependent Director\nDato Seri Chee Hong Leong\nIndependent Director\nNg Kim Kiat\nIndependent Director\nAng Siak Keng\nIndependent Director\nBelow is a summary of the business experience of each of our executive officers and directors:\nMr. Joseph Lee Moh Hon, the Chairman of our board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer, has more than 16 years of experience in cross-border investment across Asia Pacific, seizing the unique investment opportunities lie within regional investments. Since 2004, Mr. Lee has been actively involved in private equity and venture capital investment. In 2006, Mr. Lee joined Kuwait Finance House (Malaysia) Bhd. as the pioneer team in setting up their private equity division and first Islamic private equity fund in Asia Pacific. He was involved in control buyout deals in China and Southeast Asia mainly in the manufacturing, waste management, healthcare, retail, and aquaculture sectors. In 2015, Mr. Lee founded Kairous Capital, a regional venture capital firm focusing on technology investments across China and Southeast Asia. To date, Kairous has invested in more than 10 companies in the Asia Pacific region covering the areas of Fintech, Insuretech, Digital Health, E-commerce, and Tech Media. He is currently sitting on the board of more than 20 private companies. Mr. Lee is also the responsible officer of Kairous (Hong Kong), a licensed asset management company regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission of Hong Kong. Mr. Lee is considered one of the pioneer investment experts in the region focusing on cross-border investments within Asia Pacific. To date, Mr. Lee has successfully invested in more than 25 companies and exited many of them through trade sales and initial public offering in London Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and Shanghai Stock Exchange. He was involved in the setup of the first and largest shariah private equity fund with a size of USD100 million. Mr. Lee has been a Chartered Financial Analyst since 2000 and received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from McMaster University of Canada.\nWe believe Mr. Lees extensive venture capital experience and knowledge of the market which will be our primary source for potential business combination targets makes him an extremely valuable member of our board.\nMr. Philip Wong Cheung Wang, our Chief Financial Officer, has more than 24 years of entrepreneurship experience, including over 22 years of investment experience, across China, Hong Kong, Macau, Malaysia, Taiwan and Thailand. Mr. Wong is currently the non-executive Chairman and founder of IGM Mobile (Asia) Ltd, a Asia-focused mobile platform service provider previously listed on the London Stock Exchange. He has been managing investments for IGM Mobile (Asia) Ltd since 2002. Mr. Wong is also the founder and managing director of EverGateway Co., Ltd. a professional solution provider of electric counter measure systems and protection systems for laws enforcement in Asia. In 1997, Mr. Wong founded an information technology company in Hong Kong as one of the pioneers in China-Hong Kong cross border digital and multimedia online commerce, and at the Internet blooming era around 2000, Mr. Wong further seized the cutting-edge business opportunity for Fortune Telecom (SEHK: 110) and launched value-added mobile services in China as one of the early foreign partners for mobile operators in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. He also managed Fortune Telecoms supply chain network of over 2,000 retail and wholesale network in Asia. Apart from the Internet and mobile sectors, since 2007 Mr. Wong has been investing and involved in the media business of Noah Media, an info media, content and technology enabler for China, Hong Kong and Taiwan online and wireless medias. Since 2008, Mr. Wong has been actively involved in various investments and businesses in the sectors of renewable energy, energy saving and green technology (including hydro power plant and waste to energy projects in Thailand, energy saving solution for Malaysia and green plantation business in China). He was awarded the qualification as a certified energy auditor by the States Human Resources and Training Bureau of China in 2012. Mr. Wong holds a certificate in financial analysis and received his Master of Business and Administration degree from Glyndwr University in the United Kingdom.\nSteve Hsia Hsien-Chieng, one of our Independent Directors, has vast experience in and in-depth knowledge of startups, Internet technologies, digital marketing and advertising, e-commerce, digital transformation, and online education. As a serial entrepreneur with three decades of hands-on, multi-language, and multi-cultural operating experience across major markets in the U.S. and Asia, Steve has founded five startups in enterprise software, digital marketing, and education. He has successfully exited three startups through business sales to the largest global software and advertising media companies while building and scaling two education technology startups in Silicon Valley and China. Steve is an active angel investor and board member of multiple private and public technology companies, including Baozun, Inc. (NASDAQ: BZUN) in China, Malaysia Digital Economy Corporation in Malaysia, and Wearnes-Starchase Group in Singapore. From 1996 to 2013, Mr. Hsia was the co-founder and chief executive officer of AGENDA Corporation, the leading Pan-Asian digital marketing agency (with over 600 digital talents, and operations in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Taipei, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, and Kuala Lumpur). AGENDA Corporation was acquired by WPP plc, the worlds leading advertising and media holding company. After the acquisition, Mr. Hsia served as Asia Pacific chief operating officer of WPP Wunderman, the largest digital marketing agency under WPP. He co-managed 26 offices and 1,200 digital marketing professionals across the Asia Pacific region. The agency excelled in online brand marketing strategy, creative, technology, social media, e-commerce, e-CRM, and web analytics. WPP Wunderman provides digital marketing services to an extensive list of Fortune 500 clients worldwide and was ranked by the Advertising Age magazine as the worlds largest digital agency network from 2011 to 2013. Mr. Hsia received his Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of California, Berkeley.\nWe believe Mr. Hsias entrepreneurial experience, particularly in technology-related companies makes him an extremely valuable member of our board.\nDato Seri Chee Hong Leong is one of our Independent Directors. He began his career in 1990 coordinating corporate developments and annual strategic plans for the Leisure Holidays Group of Companies. From 1992 to 1998, Dato Seri Chee ventured into various businesses in the property development sector. He was the chief executive officer at Canary Homes Sdn Bhd and Canary Infoport Sdn Bhd and was involved in projects for the design and building of bungalows in the Klang Valley and the building and operation of a 100,000 sq. ft. Information Technology Incubation Centre at University Putra Malaysia. He subsequently joined Tanco Resort Berhad where, from 1998 to 2002, he held various positions from General Manager to executive director and chief operating officer. In March 2003, he joined SYF Resources Bhd, a furniture, boards and property development firm, initially as a member of the board of directors and has subsequently been serving as an executive director since 2011. Dato Seri Chee has served as independent director on the boards of various organizations in the palm oil, timber and building materials businesses as well as the education and healthcare sectors. Dato Seri Chee graduated with a Bachelors Degree in Engineering (Computer) in 1987 and a Masters of Business Administration in 1989, both from McMaster University, Canada.\nWe believe Dato Seri Chees experience serving on the boards of companies in a variety of industries makes him an extremely valuable member of our board.\nMr. Ng Kim Kiat is one of our Independent Directors. He has over 25 years of working experience in the accountancy profession. Presently, he is a partner of Crowe Malaysia PLT, an independent member firm of Crowe Global which is one of the top 10 network of accounting firms in the world. He has been practicing as an approved company auditor, tax agent and liquidator in Malaysia since 2003, 2003 and 2009 respectively. His experience covers a wide spectrum of services within the accountancy field, enabling him to advise clients in a holistic approach. Apart from assurance services like statutory audit and reporting accountant for initial public offerings engagements, Mr. Ng was also involved in various corporate advisory assignments such as tax planning, corporate recovery, restructuring, merger and acquisition. He has also been involved in various initial public offerings on Bursa Malaysia, Singapore Stock Exchange and London Stock Exchange. Mr. Ng graduated with an accounting degree from Universiti Pertanian Malaysia (now known as Universiti Putra Malaysia) in 1995. He has been a practicing member of Malaysian Institute of Accountants and Chartered Tax Institute of Malaysia since 1998 and 1999 respectively, and registered as an ASEAN Chartered Professional Accountant since 2020.\nWe believe Mr. Ngs accounting and mergers and acquisitions experience make him an extremely valuable member of our board.\nMr. Ang Siak Keng is one of our Independent Directors. He is a partner of Zaid Ibrahim & Co., one of the largest law firm in Malaysia with network firms in the ASEAN region. Mr. Ang leads a team of corporate commercial partners and his work covers corporate and commercial practice areas including mergers and acquisitions, equity and debt capital markets, debt and corporate restructuring, private equity, venture capital and commercial regulatory compliance, etc. Having involved in extensive corporate commercial work, Mr. Angs personal area of business focus is mergers and acquisitions, foreign direct investments and equity capital markets. He has led numerous domestic and cross-border transactions relating to private acquisitions and divestments, public takeovers, IPOs and private fund/capital raising, and has assisted numerous multinationals, foreign investors (especially China-SOEs) and leading domestic businesses in structuring their greenfield investments, including negotiating joint venture and strategic alliance and developing boutique commercial arrangements. Mr. Angs commercial experience spans across many industries including, IT, telecommunications, manufacturing, education and healthcare. He sits on the board of both public listed companies and private companies with strategic investee and foreigners. In his career, Mr. Ang was involved in more than 10 IPOs (covering Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong stock exchanges) and is currently acting as the legal counsel for 2 IPOs in Malaysia. Mr. Ang has been a practicing lawyer in Malaysia since 1997 and received his double degree of Bachelor of Law and Bachelor of Commerce (in Accounting) from University of Melbourne, Australia.\nWe believe Mr. Angs legal, securities and mergers and acquisitions experience make him an extremely valuable member of our board.\nOur directors and officers will play a key role in identifying, evaluating, and selecting target businesses, and structuring, negotiating and consummating our initial acquisition transaction. Except as described below and under - Conflicts of Interest, none of these individuals is currently a principal of or affiliated with a public company or blank check company that executed a business plan similar to our business plan. We believe that the skills and experience of these individuals, their collective access to acquisition opportunities and ideas, their contacts, and their transaction expertise should enable them to identify successfully and effect an acquisition transaction, although we cannot assure you that they will, in fact, be able to do so.\nBoard Committees\nThe Board has a standing audit, nominating and compensation committee. The independent directors oversee director nominations. Each audit committee and compensation committee has a charter.\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee, which is established in accordance with Section 3(a)(58)(A) of the Exchange Act, engages Companys independent accountants, reviewing their independence and performance; reviews the Companys accounting and financial reporting processes and the integrity of its financial statements; the audits of the Companys financial statements and the appointment, compensation, qualifications, independence and performance of the Companys independent auditors; the Companys compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; and the performance of the Companys internal audit function and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nThe members of the Audit Committee are Mr. Ng Kim Kiat, Dato Seri Chee Hong Leong and Mr. Ang Siak Keng, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQs listing standards. Ng Kim Kiat is the Chairperson of the audit committee. The Board has determined that Ng Kim Kiat qualifies as an audit committee financial expert, as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nNominating Committee\nWe have established a nominating committee of the board of directors, which consists of Mr. Ang Siak Keng, Dato Seri Chee Hong Leong and Mr. Ng Kim Kiat, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaqs listing standards. Mr. Ang Siak Keng is the Chairperson of the nominating committee. The nominating committee is responsible for overseeing the selection of persons to be nominated to serve on our board of directors. The nominating committee will consider persons identified by its members, management, shareholders, investment bankers and others. The Compensation Committee held one meeting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nThe members of the Nominating Committee are Mr. Ang Siak Keng, Dato Seri Chee Hong Leong and Mr. Ng Kim Kiat, each of whom is an independent director under NASDAQs listing standards. Ang Siak Keng is the Chairperson of the Nominating Committee.\nCompensation Committee\nWe have established a compensation committee of the board of directors, which consists of Dato Seri Chee Hong Leong, Mr. Ang Siak Keng and Mr. Ng Kim Kiat, each of whom is an independent director under Nasdaqs listing standards. Dato Seri Chee Hong Leong is the Chairperson of the compensation committee. The compensation committees duties, which are specified in our Compensation Committee Charter, include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf reviewing and approving on an annual basis the corporate goals and objectives relevant to our Chief Executive Officers compensation, evaluating our Chief Executive Officers performance in light of such goals and objectives and determining and approving the remuneration (if any) of our Chief Executive Officers based on such evaluation;\n\u25cf reviewing and approving the compensation of all of our other executive officers;\n\u25cf reviewing our executive compensation policies and plans;\n\u25cf implementing and administering our incentive compensation equity-based remuneration plans;\n\u25cf assisting management in complying with our proxy statement and annual report disclosure requirements;\n\u25cf approving all special perquisites, special cash payments and other special compensation and benefit arrangements for our executive officers and employees;\n\u25cf if required, producing a report on executive compensation to be included in our annual proxy statement; and\n\u25cf reviewing, evaluating and recommending changes, if appropriate, to the remuneration for directors.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, as indicated above, no compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, including our directors or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination. Accordingly, it is likely that prior to the consummation of an initial business combination, the compensation committee will only be responsible for the review and recommendation of any compensation arrangements entered into in connection with such initial business combination. The Compensation Committee did not hold a meeting during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nConflicts of Interest\nPotential investors should be aware of the following potential conflicts of interest:\n\u25cf None of our officers and directors is required to commit their full time to our affairs and, accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in allocating their time among various business activities.\n\u25cf In the course of their other business activities, our officers and directors may become aware of investment and business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to our company as well as the other entities with which they are affiliated. Our management has pre-existing fiduciary duties and contractual obligations and may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.\n\u25cf Our officers and directors may in the future become affiliated with entities, including other blank check companies, engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by our company.\n\u25cf The insider shares owned by our officers and directors will be released from escrow only if a business combination is successfully completed and subject to certain other limitations. Additionally, our officers and directors will not receive distributions from the trust account with respect to any of their insider shares if we do not complete a business combination. Furthermore, our initial shareholders have agreed that the private units will not be sold or transferred by them until after we have completed our initial business combination. In addition, our officers and directors may loan funds to us after the IPO and Private Placement and may be owed reimbursement for expenses incurred in connection with certain activities on our behalf which would only be repaid if we complete an initial business combination. For the foregoing reasons, the personal and financial interests of our directors and executive officers may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, completing a business combination in a timely manner and securing the release of their shares.\nUnder Cayman Islands law, directors owe the following fiduciary duties:\n(i) duty to act in good faith in what the director believes to be in the best interests of the company as a whole;\n(ii) duty to exercise powers for the purposes for which those powers were conferred and not for a collateral purpose;\n(iii) directors should not improperly fetter the exercise of future discretion;\n(iv) duty not to put themselves in a position in which there is a conflict between their duty to the company and their personal interests; and\n(v) duty to exercise independent judgment.\nIn addition to the above, directors also owe a duty to act with skill, care and diligence. This duty has been defined as a requirement to act as a reasonably diligent person having both the general knowledge, skill and experience that may reasonably be expected of a person carrying out the same functions as are carried out by that director in relation to the company and the general knowledge skill and experience which that director has.\nAs set out above, directors have a duty not to put themselves in a position of conflict and this includes a duty not to engage in self-dealing, or to otherwise benefit as a result of their position. However, in some instances what would otherwise be a breach of this duty can be forgiven and/or authorized in advance by the shareholders provided that there is full disclosure by the directors. This can be done by way of permission granted in the amended and restated memorandum and articles of association or alternatively by shareholder approval at general meetings.\nAccordingly, as a result of multiple business affiliations, our officers and directors may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting the above-listed criteria to multiple entities. In addition, conflicts of interest may arise when our board evaluates a particular business opportunity with respect to the above-listed criteria. We cannot assure you that any of the above mentioned conflicts will be resolved in our favor. Furthermore, most of our officers and directors have pre-existing fiduciary obligations to other businesses of which they are officers or directors. To the extent they identify business opportunities which may be suitable for the entities to which they owe pre-existing fiduciary obligations, our officers and directors will honor those fiduciary obligations. Accordingly, it is possible they may not present opportunities to us that otherwise may be attractive to us unless the entities to which they owe pre-existing fiduciary obligations and any successors to such entities have declined to accept such opportunities.\nIn order to minimize potential conflicts of interest which may arise from multiple corporate affiliations, each of our officers and directors has contractually agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, until the earliest of a business combination, our liquidation or such time as he ceases to be an officer or director, to present to our company for our consideration, prior to presentation to any other entity, any suitable business opportunity which may reasonably be required to be presented to us, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations he might have.\nThe following table summarizes the other relevant pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations of our officers and directors:\nName of Individual\nName of Affiliated\nCompany\nAffiliation\nEntitys Business\nJoseph Lee Moh Hon\nKairous Capital (Hainan) Co.

Bhd.\nDirector\nPrecious metal recovery and recycling\nIn connection with the vote required for any business combination, all of our existing shareholders, including all of our officers and directors, have agreed to vote their respective insider shares and private shares in favor of any proposed business combination. In addition, they have agreed to waive their respective rights to participate in any liquidation distribution with respect to those ordinary shares acquired by them prior to the IPO and Private Placement. If they purchase ordinary shares in the IPO or in the open market, however, they would be entitled to participate in any liquidation distribution in respect of such shares but have agreed not to convert such shares (or sell their shares in any tender offer) in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination or an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association relating to pre-business combination activity.\nAll ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nTo further minimize conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate our initial business combination with an entity that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or initial shareholders, unless we have obtained (i) an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view and (ii) the approval of a majority of our disinterested and independent directors (if we have any at that time). Furthermore, in no event will any of our initial shareholders, officers, directors, special advisors or their respective affiliates be paid any finders fee, consulting fee or other similar compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of our initial business combination.\nCode of Ethics\nWe adopted a code of conduct and ethics applicable to our directors, officers and employees in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. The code of ethics codifies the business and ethical principles that govern all aspects of our business.\nSection 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance\nSection 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, requires our executive officers, directors and persons who beneficially own more than 10% of a registered class of our equity securities to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission initial reports of ownership and reports of changes in ownership of our ordinary shares and other equity securities. These executive officers, directors, and greater than 10% beneficial owners are required by SEC regulation to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms filed by such reporting persons.\nBased solely on our review of such forms furnished to us and written representations from certain reporting persons, we believe that all filing requirements applicable to our executive officers, directors and greater than 10% beneficial owners were filed in a timely manner. ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nEmployment Agreements\nWe have not entered into any employment agreements with our executive officers, and have not made any agreements to provide benefits upon termination of employment.\nExecutive Officers and Director Compensation\nNo executive officer has received any cash compensation for services rendered to us. No compensation of any kind, including finders, consulting or other similar fees, will be paid to any of our existing shareholders, including our directors, or any of their respective affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination. However, such individuals will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of these out-of-pocket expenses and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of directors and audit committee, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged.

The address for the reporting person is 222 Berkeley St., 16th floor, Boston, Massachusetts 02116.\nAll of the insider shares issued and outstanding prior to the IPO were placed in escrow with Continental, as escrow agent, until the earlier of (1) six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination; or (2) after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, and subsequently, we consummate a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities or other property; or (3) after 150 calendar days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, and subsequently, the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period. If after the consummation of our initial business combination, whereby all the outstanding shares are exchanged or redeemed for cash or another issuers shares, then the insider shares shall be permitted to come out of escrow to participate.\nDuring the escrow period, the holders of these shares will not be able to sell or transfer their securities except (i) for transfers to our officers, directors or their respective affiliates (including for transfers to an entitys members upon its liquidation), (ii) to relatives and trusts for estate planning purposes, (iii) by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death, (iv) pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order, (v) by certain pledges to secure obligations incurred in connection with purchases of our securities, (vi) by private sales made at or prior to the consummation of a business combination at prices no greater than the price at which the shares were originally purchased or (vii) to us for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, in each case (except for clause (vii)) where the transferee agrees to the terms of the escrow agreement, but will retain all other rights as our shareholders, including, without limitation, the right to vote their ordinary shares and the right to receive cash dividends, if declared. If dividends are declared and payable in ordinary shares, such dividends will also be placed in escrow. If we are unable to effect a business combination and liquidate the trust account, none of our initial shareholders will receive any portion of the liquidation proceeds with respect to their insider shares.\nIn order to meet our working capital needs, our initial shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued units to acquire 160,000 ordinary shares (which includes 10,000 shares issuable upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 50,000 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted). Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a business combination, the loans will not be repaid.\nOur Sponsor and our executive officers and directors are deemed to be our promoters, as that term is defined under the Federal securities laws. ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nIn April, May and October 2021, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 2,156,250 insider shares, for an aggregate offering price of $25,000 at an average purchase price of approximately $0.012 per share.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the IPO, the Company consummated the Private Placement of an aggregate of 348,143 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $3,481,430. On December 16, 2021, the Sponsor purchased 9,000 additional units, gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $90,000. In February 2022, our Sponsor has canceled 206,250 insider shares without any consideration.\nOn April 23, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $200,000.\nOn May 12, 2021, the amount of promissory note was further increased to $1,000,000. On December 10, 2021, the Sponsor has agreed to provide an extension to the maturity date of the original promissory note to the term as described below.\nThe Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) July 30, 2023 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination. As of June 30, 2022, there was $70,000 outstanding under the Promissory Note.\nIn order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of the IPO, our initial shareholders, officers and directors and their respective affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not complete a business combination, the loans would be repaid out of funds not held in the trust account, and only to the extent available.\nThe holders of our insider shares issued and outstanding prior to the date of the IPO, as well as the holders of the private units (and all underlying securities) and any securities our initial shareholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may be issued in payment of working capital loans made to us, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to offering registration rights agreement. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that we register such securities. The holders of the majority of the insider shares can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time commencing three months prior to the date on which these ordinary shares are to be released from escrow. The holders of a majority of the private units or securities issued in payment of working capital loans made to us can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after we consummate a business combination. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our consummation of a business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nWe will reimburse our officers and directors for any reasonable out-of-pocket business expenses incurred by them in connection with certain activities on our behalf such as identifying and investigating possible target businesses and business combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and the interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business combination. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to any initial shareholder or member of our management team, or our or their respective affiliates, and any reimbursements and payments made to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.\nThe Sponsor has paid the expenses incurred by the Company an aggregate of $213,746 on a non-interest bearing basis as of June 30, 2022. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company owed a balance of $70,000 and $nil, respectively, to our Sponsor.\nThe Company is obligated to pay our Sponsor a monthly fee of $5,000 for general and administrative services. However, pursuant to the terms of such agreement, the Company may delay payment of such monthly fee upon a determination by the Companys audit committee that the Company lack sufficient funds held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with the initial business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of our initial business combination.\nAll ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions, including the payment of any compensation, will require prior approval by a majority of our uninterested independent directors (to the extent we have any) or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our disinterested independent directors (or, if there are no independent directors, our disinterested directors) determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties.\nRelated Party Policy\nOur Code of Ethics requires us to avoid, wherever possible, all related party transactions that could result in actual or potential conflicts of interests, except under guidelines approved by the board of directors (or the audit committee). Related-party transactions are defined as transactions in which (1) the aggregate amount involved will or may be expected to exceed $120,000 in any calendar year, (2) we or any of our subsidiaries is a participant, and (3) any (a) executive officer, director or nominee for election as a director, (b) greater than 5% beneficial owner of our ordinary shares, or (c) immediate family member, of the persons referred to in clauses (a) and (b), has or will have a direct or indirect material interest (other than solely as a result of being a director or a less than 10% beneficial owner of another entity). A conflict of interest situation can arise when a person takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work objectively and effectively. Conflicts of interest may also arise if a person, or a member of his or her family, receives improper personal benefits as a result of his or her position.\nWe also require each of our directors and executive officers to annually complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.\nOur audit committee, pursuant to its written charter, will be responsible for reviewing and approving related-party transactions to the extent we enter into such transactions. All ongoing and future transactions between us and any of our officers and directors or their respective affiliates will be on terms believed by us to be no less favorable to us than are available from unaffiliated third parties. Such transactions will require prior approval by our audit committee and a majority of our uninterested independent directors, or the members of our board who do not have an interest in the transaction, in either case who had access, at our expense, to our attorneys or independent legal counsel. We will not enter into any such transaction unless our audit committee and a majority of our disinterested independent directors determine that the terms of such transaction are no less favorable to us than those that would be available to us with respect to such a transaction from unaffiliated third parties. Additionally, we require each of our directors and executive officers to complete a directors and officers questionnaire that elicits information about related party transactions.\nThese procedures are intended to determine whether any such related party transaction impairs the independence of a director or presents a conflict of interest on the part of a director, employee or officer.\nTo further minimize potential conflicts of interest, we have agreed not to consummate a business combination with an entity which is affiliated with any of our initial shareholders unless we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view. Furthermore, in no event will any of our existing officers, directors or initial shareholders, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finders fee, consulting fee or other compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of a business combination.\nDirector Independence\nNasdaq listing standards require that within one year of the listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market we have at least three independent directors and that a majority of our board of directors be independent. For a description of the director independence, see above Part III, Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance. ITEM 14. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe following is a summary of fees paid or to be paid to Marcum Asia CPAs LLP (formerly Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP) (MarcumAsia), for services rendered.\nAudit Fees. Audit fees consist of fees billed for professional services rendered for the audit of our year-end financial statements and services that are normally provided by the chosen registered public accounting firm in connection with regulatory filings. The aggregate fees billed by Marcum Asia for professional services rendered for the audit of our 2021 and 2022 annual financial statements, review of the financial information included in our Forms 10-Q and other required filings with the SEC for the year ended June 30, 2022 totaled $141,203. The above amounts include interim procedures and audit fees, as well as attendance at audit committee meetings.\nAudit-Related Fees. Audit-related services consist of fees billed for assurance and related services that are reasonably related to performance of the audit or review of our financial statements and are not reported under Audit Fees. These services include attest services that are not required by statute or regulation and consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards. We did not pay Marcum Asia for consultations concerning financial accounting and reporting standards during the year ended June 30, 2022 and for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021.\nTax Fees. We did not pay Marcum Asia for tax planning and tax advice for the year ended June 30, 2022 and the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021.\nAll Other Fees. We did not pay Marcum Asia for other services for the year ended June 30, 2022 and the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021.\nPre-Approval of Services\nOur audit committee was formed prior to the consummation of our IPO. As a result, the audit committee did not pre-approve all of the foregoing services, although any services rendered prior to the formation of our audit committee were approved by our board of directors. Since the formation of our audit committee, and on a going-forward basis, the audit committee has and will pre-approve all auditing services and permitted non-audit services to be performed for us by our auditors, including the fees and terms thereof (subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in the Exchange Act which are approved by the audit committee prior to the completion of the audit).\nPART IV ITEM 15.

LIMITED\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 5395)\nBalance Sheets\nStatements of Operations\nStatements of Changes in Shareholders Deficit\nStatements of Cash Flows\nNotes to Financial Statements\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Kairous Acquisition Corp. Limited\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kairous Acquisition Corp. Limited (the Company) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, change in shareholders deficit and cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022 and for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021 and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended June 30, 2022 and for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nExplanatory Paragraph - Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1, the Company has incurred significant losses and needs to raise additional funds to meet its future obligations and sustain its operations. The Company has until September 16, 2023 to consummate the proposed business combination. If a business combination is not consummated by then, there will be a liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Marcum Asia CPAs LLP\nMarcum Asia CPAs LLP\nFormerly Marcum Bernstein & Pinchuk LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nNew York, NY\nOctober 13, 2022\nFirm ID#: 5395\nNEW YORK OFFICE 7 Penn Plaza Suite 830 New York, New York 10001\nPhone 646.442.4845 Fax 646.349.5200 www.marcumasia.com\nKAIROUS ACQUISITION CORP.

LIMITED\nFOR THE PERIOD FROM MARCH 24, 2021 (INCEPTION) THROUGH JUNE 30, 2022\nNotes to the financial statements\nNOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS\nKairous Acquisition Corp. Limited (the Company) was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 24, 2021. The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.\nAll activity for the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2022 relates to the Companys formation and the initial public offering (Initial Public Offering), which is described below, and negotiation and consummation of an initial Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion an initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected June 30 as its fiscal year end.\nThe registration statement for the Companys Initial Public Offering was declared effective on December 13, 2021. On December 16, 2021, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 7,500,000 units (Units and, with respect to the ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares), generating gross proceeds of $75,000,000, which is described in Note 3. The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option by purchasing 300,000 additional units, generating $3,000,000. The underwriter has further indicated that they will not exercise the remaining over-allotment option, hence the remaining 825,000 units will be forfeited.\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement) of an aggregate of 348,143 Units (the Private Placement Units) to Kairous Asia Limited (the Sponsor) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Units, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $3,481,430. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the option at which time the Sponsor purchasing 9,000 additional units, generating $90,000.\nAs of December 16, 2021, transaction costs amounted to $4,843,252 consisting of $1,559,900 of underwriting fees, $2,730,000 of deferred underwriting fees payable (which are held in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee (the Trust Account) and $553,352 of other offering costs related to the Initial Public Offering. Cash of $857,408 was held outside of the Trust Account on December 16, 2021 and was available for working capital purposes. As described in Note 6, the $2,730,000 deferred underwriting fees are contingent upon the consummation of the Business Combination within 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.\nFollowing the closing of the Initial Public Offering on December 16, 2021, an amount of $78,780,000 ($10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement was placed in the Trust Account which may be invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account, as described below.\nThe Companys management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that $10.00 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Units, will be held in a trust account (the Trust Account) and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Companys shareholders, as described below.\nThe Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the Public Shareholders) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a shareholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Shareholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.10 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.\nAll of the Public Shares contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Companys liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Companys Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Incorporation). In accordance with the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and its guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of a company require ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Given that the Public Shares will be issued with other freestanding instruments (i.e., public warrants), the initial carrying value of the ordinary shares classified as temporary equity will be the allocated proceeds determined in accordance with ASC 470-20. The ordinary shares are subject to ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either (i) accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or (ii) recognize changes in the redemption value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes immediately. The Public Shares are redeemable and will be classified as such on the balance sheet until such date that a redemption event takes place. Redemptions of the Companys Public Shares may be subject to the satisfaction of conditions, including minimum cash conditions, pursuant to an agreement relating to the Companys Business Combination.\nIf the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against a proposed Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares without the Companys prior written consent.\nThe Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Companys obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Companys initial Business Combination or to redeem 100% of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment.\nIf the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 21 months, if we extend the time to complete a business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period), the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Companys remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Companys obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.\nThe Sponsor has agreed to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to the Founder Shares it will receive if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor or any of its respective affiliates acquire Public Shares, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).\nIn order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Companys independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) $10.10 per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.10 per Public Share, due to reductions in the value of trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay taxes. This liability will not apply to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and as to any claims under the Companys indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavouring to have all vendors, service providers (other than the Companys independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.\nGoing Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had insufficient liquidity to meet its future obligations. As of June 30, 2022, the Company had working capital of $471,831 and cash of $482,965. The Company has a history of losses, an accumulated deficit and has not generated cash from operations to support its ongoing business plan. The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans and will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial business combination. In addition, the Company expects to have negative cash flows from operations as it pursues an initial business combination target.\nIn connection with the Companys assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management has determined that its history of losses and insufficient liquidity raise substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination within 21 months from the closing of the IPO (less than 12 months within filing of these financial statements), the Company is required to cease all operations, redeem the public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe Company intends to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires the Company to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires the Company to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, the Company will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Companys financial position, results of its operations, close of the Initial Public Offering and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements.\nAdditionally, as a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Companys ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, the Companys ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.\nNOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying audited financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.\nEmerging Growth Company\nThe Company is an emerging growth company, as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the JOBS Act), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Companys financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Companys management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.\nMaking estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company had cash of $482,965 and $nil and no cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInvestments held in Trust Account\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had approximately $78.9 million in investments held in the Trust Account. The Companys portfolio of investments held in the Trust Account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act.\nOffering Costs associated with the Initial Public Offering\nThe Company complies with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) Topic 5A, Expenses of Offering. Offering costs of $894,582 consisted principally of costs incurred in connection with preparation for the Initial Public Offering. These offering costs, together with the underwriter fees of $4,289,900 (or $1,559,900 paid in cash upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and a deferred fee of $2,730,000), were charged to stockholders equity upon completion of the Initial Public Offering.\nOrdinary shares subject to possible redemption\nThe Company accounts for its ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable ordinary shares (including ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Companys control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Companys ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Companys control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2022, the 7,800,000 ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in the amount of $78,894,512 are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of the Companys balance sheets.\nThe Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized a measurement adjustment from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit of approximately $13.8 million.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the ordinary shares reflected on the balance sheets is reconciled in the following table:\nSCHEDULE OF CONTINGENTLY REDEEMABLE CLASS A COMMON STOCK\nGross proceeds $ 78,000,000\nLess:\nTransaction costs allocated to ordinary shares (4,599,397 )\nProceeds allocated to Public Rights and Warrants (8,275,800 )\n(12,875,197 )\nPlus:\nRemeasurement adjustment of carrying value to redemption value 13,655,197\nCurrent period measurement adjustment of ordinary shares to redemption value 114,512\nOrdinary shares subject to possible redemption $ 78,894,512\nWarrants\nThe Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrants specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity (ASC 480) and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Companys own ordinary shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Companys control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.\nFor issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. The Company determined that upon further review of the warrant agreements, the Company concluded that its warrants qualify for equity accounting treatment.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of June 30, 2022 and 2021. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position.\nThere is currently no taxation imposed on income by the Government of the Cayman Islands. In accordance with Cayman income tax regulations, income taxes are not levied on the Company. Consequently, income taxes are not reflected in the Companys financial statements.\nNet Loss per Ordinary Share\nNet loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the period presented.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account. The Company has not experienced any losses on the Trust Account.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of the Companys assets and liabilities, which qualify as financial instruments under ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, approximates the carrying amounts represented in the balance sheet, primarily due to their short-term nature. The Company determines fair value based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market. When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:\nLevel 1 Inputs: Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 Inputs: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 Inputs: Significant inputs into the valuation model are unobservable.\nThe Company does not have any recurring Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities. The carrying value of the Companys financial instruments including its cash and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values principally because of their short-term nature.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation (ASC 718), which establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for share-based employee compensation. It defines a fair value-based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument.\nThe Company recognizes all forms of share-based payments, including stock option grants, warrants and restricted stock grants, at their fair value on the grant date, which are based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest.\nShare-based compensation expenses are included in general and administrative expenses in the statement of operations. Share-based payments issued to placement agents are classified as a direct cost of a share offering and are recorded as a reduction in additional paid in capital.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nNOTE 3 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING\nPursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold 7,500,000 Units at a purchase price of $10.00 per Unit generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $75,000,000. Each Unit will consist of one ordinary share, one half of one redeemable warrant (Public Warrant) and one right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of an ordinary share upon the consummation of an initial business combination. Each whole Public Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share subject to adjustment (see Note 7). Each ten rights entitle the holder thereof to receive one ordinary share at the closing of a business combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares. As a result, shareholders must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of the rights upon closing of a business combination. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option by purchasing 300,000 additional units, generating $3,000,000.\nNOTE 4 - PRIVATE PLACEMENTS\nSimultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement) of an aggregate of 348,143 Units (the Private Placement Units) at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $3,481,430. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the option at which time the Sponsor purchasing 9,000 additional units, generating $90,000.\nA portion of the proceeds from the Private Placement Units was added to the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Units held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law). The Private Placement Units will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions.\nNOTE 5 - RELATED PARTIES\nFounder Shares\nOn May 13 and October 21, 2021, the Sponsor received an aggregate of 2,156,250 of the Companys ordinary shares (the Founder Shares) in exchange for a capital contribution of $25,000 that was paid by the Sponsor for deferred offering costs. All share amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect this number of Founder Shares. The Founder Shares included an aggregate of up to 281,250 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the number of Founder Shares will equal, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20% of the Companys issued and outstanding ordinary shares after the Initial Public Offering. Due to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters, these 75,000 shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.\nThe Sponsor has agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) six months after the completion of a Business Combination or (B) the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, and subsequently, we consummate a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares for cash, securities or other property or (C) after 150 calendar days after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination, and subsequently, the closing price of our ordinary shares equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period.\nGeneral and Administrative Services\nCommencing on the date the Units are first listed on the Nasdaq, the Company has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support during the Combination Period. Upon the earlier of the completion of the Initial Business Combination or the Companys liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. During the year ended June 30, 2022 and the period from March 24, 2021 (inception) through June 30, 2021, the Company recorded $32,833 and $nil in management fees, respectively.\nPromissory Note - Related Party\nOn April 23, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the Promissory Note), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $200,000. On May 12, 2021, the amount of promissory note was further increased to $1,000,000. On December 10, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to provide an extension to the maturity date of the original promissory note. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) July 30, 2023 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Business Combination. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there was $70,000 and $nil outstanding under the Promissory Note, respectively.\nAdvances from Related Party\nThe Sponsor paid certain administrative expenses and offering costs on behalf of the Company. These advances are due on demand and are non-interest bearing. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the related party paid $213,746 of offering costs and other expenses on behalf of the Company. The advances were repaid in full upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there was $nil and $213,746 due to the related party, respectively\nWorking Capital Loans\nIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Companys officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (Working Capital Loans). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lenders discretion, up to $1,000,000 of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Placement Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under the Working Capital Loans.\nNOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRegistration Rights\nThe holders of the founder shares, Private Placement Units, shares being issued to the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering, and units that may be issued on conversion of Working Capital Loans (and in each case holders of their component securities, as applicable) will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale. The holders of these securities will be entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.\nUnderwriting Agreement\nThe Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts. On December 16, 2021, the underwriters partially exercised the over-allotment option by purchasing 300,000 additional units, generating $3,000,000.\nThe underwriters were paid to a cash underwriting discount of $0.20 per Unit, or $1,500,000 in the aggregate (or $1,725,000 in the aggregate if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full), payable upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the underwriters will be entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $2,625,000 in the aggregate (or $3,018,750 in the aggregate if the underwriters over-allotment option is exercised in full). The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Upon partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the Company paid the underwriters an additional fee of $59,900 (net of Representatives purchase option fee of $100) and an additional deferred fee of $105,000 which will be payable upon completion of a Business Combination.\nThe underwriters were also issued 39,000 Ordinary shares as representative shares, in connection with the IPO. Upon close of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recorded additional issuance costs of $341,230, the grant date fair value of the shares, with an offset to additional paid-in capital.\nAdvisory Agreement\nOn March 9, 2022, the Company entered into a letter agreement with Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (Chardan) in which the company retains Chardan to provide strategic and capital markets advisory services. As compensation for such services, the Company is to pay Chardan advisory fees as defined in the agreement which become payable upon the consummation of the business combination.\nNOTE 7 - SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY\nOrdinary Shares - The Company is authorized to issue 500,000,000 ordinary shares with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to one vote for each share. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were 2,346,143 and 2,156,250 ordinary shares issued and outstanding in shareholders equity, respectively. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there were an additional 7,800,000 and no ordinary shares included in temporary equity on the balance sheets.\nHolders of ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide or voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of the IPO.\nRights - Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a business combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive one-tenth (1/10) of one ordinary share upon consummation of the initial business combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of Cayman law.\nWarrants -Each whole warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of ordinary share at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing 30 days after the completion of an initial business combination. However, no warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current Form 10-K relating to such ordinary shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective by the 90th day following the consummation of the initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. In the event of such cashless exercise, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose will mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date of exercise. The warrants will expire on the fifth anniversary of our completion of an initial business combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.\nThe private warrants, as well as any warrants underlying additional units the Company issued to the Sponsor, officers, directors, initial shareholders or their affiliates in payment of working capital loans made to the Company, will be identical to the warrants underlying the units being offered.\nThe Company may call the warrants for redemption, in whole and not in part, at a price of $0.01 per warrant,\n\u25cf at any time after the warrants become exercisable,\n\u25cf upon not less than 30 days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder,\n\u25cf if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the ordinary shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations), for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period commencing at any time after the warrants become exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to warrant holders; and\n\u25cf if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the ordinary shares underlying such warrants.\nThe right to exercise will be forfeited unless the warrants are exercised prior to the date specified in the notice of redemption. On and after the redemption date, a record holder of a warrant will have no further rights except to receive the redemption price for such holders warrant upon surrender of such warrant.\nThe redemption criteria for our warrants have been established at a price which is intended to provide warrant holders a reasonable premium to the initial exercise price and provide a sufficient differential between the then- prevailing share price and the warrant exercise price so that if the share price declines as a result of our redemption call, the redemption will not cause the share price to drop below the exercise price of the warrants.\nIf the Company calls the warrants for redemption as described above, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis. In such event, each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of ordinary shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of ordinary shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value for this purpose shall mean the average reported last sale price of the ordinary shares for the 10 trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants.\nThe warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder (i) to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake, including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreement set forth in this Form 10-K, or to cure, correct or supplement any defective provision, or (ii) to add or change any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under the warrant agreement as the parties to the warrant agreement may deem necessary or desirable and that the parties deem to not adversely affect the interests of the registered holders of the warrants, but requires the approval, by written consent or vote, of the holders of at least 50% of the then outstanding public warrants in order to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders.\nThe warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price, by certified or official bank check payable to us, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of ordinary shares and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive ordinary shares. After the issuance of ordinary shares upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by shareholders.\nWarrant holders may elect to be subject to a restriction on the exercise of their warrants such that an electing warrant holder would not be able to exercise their warrants to the extent that, after giving effect to such exercise, such holder would beneficially own in excess of 9.8% of the ordinary shares outstanding.\nNo fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company will, upon exercise, round up to the nearest whole number the number of ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.\nNOTE 8 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nThe Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date through October 13, 2022, the date that the financial statements were issued. Based upon this review, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements."
