    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS.\nBackground\nShengda Network Technology, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on March 14, 2018 in the State of Nevada under the name Soltrest, Inc. On March 30, 2020, we filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation changing our name to Shengda Network Technology, Inc.\nOn April 20, 2020, we purchased 100% of the shares of Peaker International Trade Group Limited (Hong Kong) (Peaker) for a total purchase price of US$1,330. This purchase was made through our wholly owned subsidiary Jingmao Webmall, Inc., incorporated in the Cayman Islands on August 11, 2020. Peaker presently owns 100% of Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd., which is located in Zhejiang province, China. Thereafter, on May 15, 2020, Peaker incorporated in China a 100%-owned subsidiary, Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd. (China) (Jingmai Electronic) which is intended to serve as an operating company in China for our activities in China.\nJingmai Electronic has begun to supply goods to various social e-commerce platforms and merchants. Social e-commerce refers to the process of engaging customers at every point of their buying journey. Jingmai Electronic is designed to provide high-quality supply chain resources and is quicky moving into live broadcast management services in order to provide sustainable development for the Company. Jingmai Electronic, and its subsidiaries, also intend to provide comprehensive services, such as supply chain management and live broadcasting resources to TikTok and other social e-commerce platforms.\nRecent Developments\nOn April 22, 2022, the Company obtained 99% ownership of the following subsidiaries:\n\u25cf Yiwu Tianqi Enterprise Management Co., Ltd.;\n\u25cf Zhejiang Jingmai e-commerce Co., Ltd.;\n\u25cf Zhejiang Jingtao Supply Chain Co., Ltd., and\nThe interest in all of these subsidiaries was acquired for no consideration.\nOn June 28, 2022, the board of directors (the Board) of the Company dismissed SS Accounting & Auditing, Inc., as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, and engaged Paris Kreit & Chiu CPA LLP, (Paris Kreit), as the Companys new independent registered public accounting firm.\nOn August 15, 2022, the size of the Board was increased to five members. Mr. Yizhong Chen, Mr. Hanguo Li, Mr. Manu Ohri and Mr. Yanfeng Wang were appointed as independent directors of the Board, effective the same date. In addition, effective the same date, the Board created an Audit Committee, a Nominating Committee and a Compensation Committee and also adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The Company also adopted amended and restated bylaws.\nCovid-19 Pandemic\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The Company is currently monitoring the outbreak of COVID-19 and the related business and travel restrictions and changes to behavior intended to reduce its spread.\nWhile the Companys operations are principally located outside the United States, we utilize various consultants located in the United States, we participate in a global supply chain, and the existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments around the world in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Disruptions to our supply chain and business operations, or to our suppliers or customers supply chains and business operations, could include disruptions from the closure of supplier and manufacturer facilities, interruptions in the supply of raw materials and components, personnel absences, or restrictions on the shipment of our or our suppliers or customers products, any of which could have adverse ripple effects on our manufacturing output and delivery schedule. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nDescription of Product or Services\nWe provide portals (similar to Amazon, Inc.) for the sale of products offered by reliable manufacturers and merchants at competitive prices. Products run the gamut from electronics to daily consumable products, food and clothing. We purchase goods according to market demand, directly from manufacturers that we have standing relationships with. The goods we source include, but are not limited to, electronic products, daily consumer goods such as shampoo and toothpaste, and various other items.\nWe then sell the goods we purchase, as well as products from other reliable merchants, to our various customers. Our Company is similar to a wholesaler in that our customers purchase goods from us bulk. We aim to effectively organize suppliers, manufacturers and distributors in order to minimize the costs of the whole supply chain system and offer competitive prices. Our Company does not warehouse or store any of the good we purchase. If the manufacturer we purchase from is not able to ship the goods directly to our customers, then our Company manages the logistics and arranges for a third-party shipping company.\nOur Company actively cooperates with other listed or state-owned enterprises. On May 23, 2022, we entered into a commodity purchase contract, through Yiwu Tianqi Enterprise Management Co., Ltd., with Kunming Pharmaceutical Group, a state-owned enterprise. We also engage with companies whose products we feel are of good quality and that also need new channels, specifically social e-commerce. We cooperate with these companies so that they can expand their sales and supplies by offering our products and services on their sites\nTarget Market and Clients/Potential Clients\nOur current target market is China, where we engage in e-commerce services. In recent years, with the rapid rise of social e-commerce, the Company began to diversify. Our sales channels have gradually changed from offline to online and from a single product sales business into a more comprehensive business of supply chain management.\nThe products supplied through our channels are high-quality and readily available products offered by a significant number of registered companies to members on our sales portals. At this date, we have over 500,000 registered and active members. We also do online market promotion through our online shopping malls and membership networks, word of mouth and social media such as WeChat. We also intend to offer products through offline stores and customer service centers. It is our goal to build the strongest Internet shopping channel in China.\nDuring the initial phase of our development, our main target clients were individual users that browse internet on a daily basis. Beginning in January 2022, our second and current phase of business development is focusing on growth through providing services and products to small companies. If we succeed with these smaller companies, we intend to offer our products and services to medium sized corporations.\nSources of Revenue\nOur revenue is generated in three main areas: traditional trade sales, which are sales to physical, offline stores; online wholesale sales, which are sales to online sellers; and sales of services which provide enterprises with marketing and promotion related services such as providing live broadcasting resources, technical services, and promotional services, among others.\nWe have identified three main marketing client groups associated with the various streams of revenue: individual users of personal computers and other internet enabled devices, and medium sized companies.\nWe are marketing to personal computing and other internet enabled device users with our WebMall sales and service. As of 2021, there were 340 million sales of personal computers and internet enabled devices, and several billion are expected over the next three to five years. Capturing a small sector of this user population could allow us to sell our products and services at a very attractive and affordable prices.\nGrowth Strategy\nWithin the next six months, we will provide services to a variety of locales in China. Zhejiang is the center of China, and we have estimated that 80% of our members are in Hubei, Jiangxi, Shanxi, Hebei, Anhui, Fujian and other provinces. Our members include users who register with us through email. The services we intend to provide are traditional trade sales, which are sales to physical, offline stores; online wholesale sales, which are sales to online sellers; and sales of services which provide enterprises with marketing and promotion related services such as providing live broadcasting resources, technical services, and promotional services, among others.\nOnce we have a core of business in China, we plan to expand to Southeast Asia, Europe and Latin America in over the next five to six years.\nCompetition\nCurrently, our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have just recently started our operations. There are currently in the market larger and better-financed companies providing similar services.\nThe online sales industry is highly competitive. We compete with other numerous other firms, including larger regional, national and international firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Among these competitors are Amazon, Inc., Alibaba, Jingdong, and PinDuoDuo. Competitive factors include the level of technical expertise and experience, industry reputation, quality of work, price, geographic presence, dependability, availability of skilled personnel and financial stability. Our management believes that we can compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. There can be no assurance that our competitors will not develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services, or that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe that our business model provides certain competitive advantages:\n\u25cf Offering free membership to consumers who utilize our services, including preferential shipping;\n\u25cf Offering a sharing of the economic benefits by offering discounts and rebates to regular customers; and\n\u25cf Providing superior customer services through all sales portals and physical locations.\nEmployees\nAs of October 28, 2022, we had 50 employees, all of whom were full-time.\nUncertainties Facing the Company\nAs an early-stage company, the Company expects to experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate additional revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.\nOne of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund to keep operation, including securing adequate capital to pay for operations and hiring service providers. Secondarily, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales and marketing strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy; however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19). On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In addition, as of the time of the filing of this Report, many states in the United States are still experiencing high rates of infection and many countries around the world, including the United States and China, have taken steps to restrict travel. The existence of a worldwide pandemic, the fear associated with COVID-19, or any, pandemic, and the reactions of governments in response to COVID-19, or any, pandemic, to regulate the flow of labor and products and impede the travel of personnel, may impact our ability to conduct normal business operations, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity. Global health concerns, such as COVID-19, could also result in social, economic, and labor instability in the markets in which we operate. Any of these uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\nOn January 5, 2021, Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd. leased an office on the 4th floor of Block 3A, Lugang E-commerce Town, Yiwu City, in Zhejiang, China. The lease term of the office is from January 5, 2021 to April 5, 2022. There was a rent-free period January 5, 2021 to April 5, 2021. The monthly rent is $388. On March 20, 2022, Zhejian Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd. leased an office in Zhejiang, China. The lease term of the office is from April 1, 2022 to March 30, 2023. The monthly rent is $373. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. From time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY; RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND SMALL BUSINESS ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\nMarket Information\nCommon Stock\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Pink under the symbol SDWL. On October 12, 2022, the closing price of our stock was $7.70.\nOur common stock is considered to be penny stock under rules promulgated by the SEC.

Broker-dealers must also disclose these restrictions in writing, provide monthly account statements to customers, and obtain specific written consent of each customer. With these restrictions, the likely effect of designation as a penny stock is to decrease the willingness of broker-dealers to make a market for the stock, to decrease the liquidity of the stock and increase the transaction cost of sales and purchases of these stocks compared to other securities.\nPreferred Stock\nSeries A Preferred Stock\nOn November 10, 2020, the Board designated 1,000,000 shares as Series A Preferred Stock.

If additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities, these securities may have rights, preferences, and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations. Regardless of whether our cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet our operational needs, we may seek to compensate providers of services by issuance of stock in lieu of cash, which may also result in dilution to existing shareholders. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses, fail to collect significant amounts owed to us, or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing.\nNo assurance can be given that sources of financing will be available to us and/or that demand for our equity/debt instruments will be sufficient to meet our capital needs, or that financing will be available on terms favorable to us. If funding is insufficient at any time in the future, we may not be able to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or may be required to reduce the scope of our planned service development and marketing efforts, any of which could have a negative impact on our business and operating results. In addition, insufficient funding may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, which could require us to:\n\u25cf Curtail our operations significantly, or\n\u25cf Seek arrangements with strategic partners or other parties that may require us to relinquish significant rights to technology platform and correlated services, or\n\u25cf Explore other strategic alternatives including a merger or sale of our Company.\nOperating Activities\nFor the year ended June 30, 2022, net cash used in operating activities of $8,066,026 was primarily a result of income of $4,324,608, depreciation and amortization of $19,165, provision for uncollectible receivables of $12,780, and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $2,444,313 due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $1,709,284, no increase or decrease in prepaid expenses, a decrease in accounts payable of $389,562, a decrease in advance to suppliers of approximately $10 million, an increase in accrued expenses and other payables of $213,551, and a decrease in advances and deposits of $30,982.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2021, net cash used in operating activities of $2,562,524 was primarily a result of a loss of $2,716,347, depreciation and amortization of $12,871, provision for uncollectible receivables of $3,749,348, and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of $3,608,396 due to an increase in accounts receivable of $4,177,743, a decrease in prepaid expense of $4,325, an increase in accounts payable of $467,573, an increase in accrued expenses and other payables of $68,577, an increase in advances and deposits of $30,202, and a decrease in other payables to a related party of $1,330.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, of $8,365,090, resulted from proceeds from collection of loan receivable from related party of $8,365,090.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, of $8,443,822, resulted from cash advanced to a customer as loan receivable of $8,365,926, and cash paid for purchase of a vehicle of $77,896.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2022, was $0.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended June 30, 2021, was $6,232,225, which consisted of cash received of $2,000 from proceeds from the sale of preferred stock to a related party and 6,230,225 from proceeds from the sale of our common stock.\nFuture Capital Requirements\nOur current available cash and equivalents are sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements. Our capital requirements for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, will depend on numerous factors, including managements evaluation of the timing of projects to pursue. Subject to our ability to generate revenues and cash flow from operations and our ability to raise additional capital (including through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships), we expect to incur substantial expenditures to carry out our business plan, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company.\nOur plans to finance our operations include seeking equity and debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements, or other business transactions, that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations.\nThe sale of additional equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned activities and limit our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInflation\nThe amounts presented in our financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis. The Company recorded a net income of $4,324,608 for the year ended June 30, 2022; excluding the recovery of bad debt from net income during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net income from operations of $491,068. The Company had cash flows from operating activities of negative $8,066,026 for the year ended June 30, 2022. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the date of this filing. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future. Our management plans to provide for our capital requirements by continuing to issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds to execute our business plan or generate positive operating results. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nManagement believes the Companys cash on hand will be sufficient to fund all of our obligations and commitments for the next twelve months. Historically, we have depended on equity and debt capital raises to provide us with working capital as required. There is no guarantee, however, that such funding will be available in the future and there can be no assurance that our stockholders, or any of them, will continue making loans or advances to us in the future.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities.\nSeasonality\nOur operating results are not affected by seasonality.\nInflation\nOur business and operating results as reported have not been affected in any material way by inflation. However, the Company is aware that global inflation is increasing, and it expects that inflation will affect the Company during fiscal year ending June 2023, though it cannot predict at this point in what ways.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe SEC issued Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies suggesting that companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies. In Financial Reporting Release No. 60, the SEC has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a companys financial condition and operating results and require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. The nature of our business generally does not call for the preparation or use of estimates. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nAs a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item.

(the Company) as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, and the related statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes and schedules (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2021, and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys financial statements are prepared using the generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company recorded a net loss for the year ended June 30, 2021, used net cash flows in operating activities, and has a net decrease in cash for the year ended June 30, 2021. These factors, among others, raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.

Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

On April 22, 2022, Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd received transfer of 99% ownership of Zhejiang Jingtao Supply Chain Co., Ltd which was incorporated on November 24, 2020 for no consideration. These companies plan to develop business in the following fields: wholesale and retail of wide range of products, management, import and export, network integration and IT service, and more fields.\nRisk and Uncertainty Concerning COVID-19 Pandemic\nSince the occurrence of COVID-19 in January 2020, it has posed great impacts in China. However, the COVID-19 outbreak has limited impact on our businesses and operation. The Company mainly operates in Zhejiang Province China, that had few cases since January 2020. None of our staff was infected with COVID-19. Therefore, the Company did not encounter a shortage of labor. As of the date of this report, the Companys is able to fulfill customers needs.\nThere might be outbreaks of COVID-19 in various cities in China in the future, and the Chinese government may take measures to keep COVID-19 in control. If there is not a material recovery in the COVID-19 situation, or the situation further deteriorates in China, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. While the potential downturn brought by and the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak is difficult to assess or predict and the full impact of the virus on our operations will depend on many factors beyond our control. Our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected to the extent that COVID-19 persists in China or harms the Chinese and global economy in general.\nAnhui Province found more local COVID-19 cases in 2021. Since Anhui Province has been successful on its efforts containing the spread of the virus, we havent observed significant impacts concerning the matters relating to logistics, suppliers, and price of raw materials.\nGoing Concern\nThe Company demonstrates adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders, the ability of the Company to sell its stock to the investing community and obtain necessary financing to continue operations, and the attainment of profitable operations. The Company recorded a net income of $4,324,608 for the year ended June 30, 2022; excluding the recovery of bad debt from net income during the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company had a net income from operations of $491,068. The Company had cash flows from operating activities of negative $8,066,026 for the year ended June 30, 2022. These factors, among others, raise a substantial doubt regarding the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 2 - Restatement for Correction of an Error\nDuring the year end June 30, 2021, the Company had sales amounting to $5,278,370 with a customer that accounted for 56% of the total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021. For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company had sales with that customer amounting to $253,803 that accounted for 100% of the total revenue for the year ended June 30, 2020. The Company also had an accounts receivable balance in the amount of $1,640,779 as of June 30, 2021, with that customer. The management subsequently discovered that the customer is a related party within the definition ASC 850.\nOn October 25, 2020, the Company signed an agreement with a related party, which is also the Companys major customer. The Company agreed to loan the related party $8,957,764 (RMB60,000,000) at an annual interest rate of 7.2%. The loan is guaranteed by a Companys supplier which is also an important partner of the Companys major customer and due on October 25, 2021. The borrower is required to pay all the principal and the relevant interest in full amount on the due date. The total loan receivable, net of allowance $0 and $6,417,350 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The principal and the relevant interest in full have been paid off in February 2022. As of June 30, 2021, the Company recognized $2,163,419 allowance of bad debt against the loan receivable from related party. During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company reversed the $2,163,419 allowance and recognized the entire amount as other income in the accompany consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income (loss). During the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company recognized the interest income of $764,421 and wrote off the interest income of $66,905. The management subsequently discovered that the customer is a related party within the definition ASC 850.\nIn the Companys annual reports on Form 10-K for the years ended June 30, 2020 and June 30, 2021 and related quarterly reports (collectively, the Affected Reports), the Company is correcting the disclosure by reporting the above as related party transactions and balances.\nThe following is a comparison of restated financial statements to financial statements as previously reported:\nConsolidated Statement of Operations Year ended June 30, 2020\nAs Previously Reported Restatement Adjustment As Restated\nRevenue $ 253,803 $ (253,803 ) $ -\nRevenue -

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Companys management, which is responsible for their integrity and objectivity. In the opinion of the Companys management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement presentation.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary Peaker International Trade Group Limited or Peaker, Peakers wholly owned subsidiary Jiangxi Zansheng Information Industry Co., Ltd, Peakers wholly owned subsidiary Zhejiang Jingmai Electronic Commerce Ltd or Jingmai Electronic, and Jingmai Electronics five 99% owned subsidiary Zhejiang Xiaojing e-commerce Co., Ltd, Yiwu Tianqi Enterprise Management Co., Ltd, Zhejiang Jingtao Supply Chain Co., Ltd, Zhejiang Jingmai e-commerce Co., Ltd and Zhejiang Shubei Supply Chain Co., Ltd, in China. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nNon-Controlling Interest\nNon-controlling interest represents the portion of equity that is not attributable to the Company. The net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests are separately presented in the accompanying statements of income and other comprehensive income (loss). Losses attributable to non-controlling interests in a subsidiary may exceed the interest in the subsidiarys equity. The related non-controlling interest continues to be attributed its share of losses even if that attribution results in a deficit of the non-controlling interest balance.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Companys estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments with maturity of three months or less at the time of issuance to be cash and cash equivalents.\nAccounts Receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are generated primarily through sales to customers and are stated at invoiced amount, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts, and bear no interest. A provision for doubtful accounts is determined based on a specific review of outstanding customer balances and historical customer write-off amounts and is charged to operations at the time management determines these accounts may become uncollectible.\nThe Company establishes a credit and collection policy based on age of receivables. The collection period usually ranges from three months to twelve months. The Company grants extended payment terms only when the Company believes that the payment will be collectible at the end of the term. The Company grants extended payment terms to customers based on the following factors: (a) whether or not the Company views a real need, from the customers perspective for the extension, and (b) the Companys relationship with the customer, and the Companys long-term business prospects.\nThe Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and based on its reviews, the Company recorded an allowance for doubtful accounts of $12,317 and $1,682,437 as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories consist of finished goods. The Company reviews its inventories regularly for possible obsolete goods and establishes reserves when determined necessary. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had no reserve for obsolete goods.\nEquipment\nEquipment is stated at cost. The straight-line depreciation method is used to compute depreciation over the estimated useful lives of the assets, as follows:\nSchedule of Estimated Useful Lives Of Assets\nItems\nUseful life\nVehicles\n5 years\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs, which do not materially extend the useful lives of the assets, are expense as incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments which substantially extend the useful life of assets are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated depreciation of assets retired or sold are removed from the respective accounts, and any gain or loss is recognized in the statement of income in other income and expenses.\nLong-lived Assets\nThe Company tests long-lived assets or asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. Circumstances which could trigger a review include, but are not limited to: significant decreases in the market price of the asset; significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors; accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the asset; current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset; and current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life. Recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amount of the asset compared to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset, as well as specific appraisal in certain instances. An impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value over the assets fair market value is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss is recorded as an expense and a direct write-down of the asset. No impairment loss was recorded for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As the implicit rate is typically not readily determinable in the Companys lease agreements, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Companys specific rate of interest to borrow on a collateralized basis, over a similar term and in a similar economic environment as the lease. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for its identified asset classes. As of June 30, 2022, the Company did not have any finance lease.\nSimilar to other long-lived assets, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment when events or conditions indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable from future cash flows. See Note 8, Leases, for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue through online networking sales. Shengda Network Technology is not involved in production. The Company mainly sells products through a significant number of registered companies to members of its sales portal. The Company offers products through offline stores and customer service centers. When the customer receives the product, the control of the products is transferred to the customer.\nThe Company recognizes revenues when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled for those goods or services. In that determination, under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, the Company follows a five-step model that includes: (1) determination of whether a contract, an agreement between two or more parties that creates legally enforceable rights and obligations, exists; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied. The Company records the revenue once all the above steps are completed.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company has established a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instruments categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement, prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:\n\u25cf Level 1 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n\u25cf Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\u25cf Level 3 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect managements estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe Companys other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash deposited with banks. Substantially all of the Companys cash is held in bank accounts in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and is not protected by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insurance or any other similar insurance.\nThe Companys bank account in the United States is protected by FDIC insurance. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys bank account in the United States had no balances exceeding FDIC insurance of $250,000.\nThe Companys bank account in Peoples Republic of China (PRC) is protected by the Peoples Bank of China Financial Stability Bureau (FSD) insurance. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Companys bank account in PRC had $247,930 and $140,277, balances exceeding FSD insurance of RMB 500,000.\nMajor Customers\nThe Company has five customers Company A - Related party, Company B, Company C, Company D, and Company E that accounted for 23%, 19%, 12%, 11% and 11% of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company has one major customer Company F- Related party that accounted for 56% of revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021. The five major customers for the year ended June 30, 2022 does not include the major customer for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nMajor Vendors\nThe Company has four vendors Company A, Company B, Company C, and Company D that accounted for 36%, 30%, 14% and 11% of purchases for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company has two vendors Company E and Company A that accounted for 71% and 29% of purchases for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nThe Company agreed to purchase $26,873,292 (RMB 180 million) from a supplier over the next three years. As of June 30, 2022, the Company has made advance payment of $8,216,644 (RMB 55 million) to the supplier, of which $5,922,077 (RMB 39,666,667) are recorded as advance to supplier - non-current. The advance is interest free and without collateral. The reasons for making such advance are that the Company started to provide products to clients who are in the internet live broadcasting business. The Company carries minimal inventory, and the supplier directly delivers the goods to customers according to purchase orders with the supplier. The advances are fully refundable and there is no penalty for the Company if it does not purchase the entire RMB 180 million of inventory.\nThe Company had fully paid for the operating lease and expects $0 lease payment during the next 12 months.\nThere are no legal proceedings and claims.\nEvents or operations that are uncertain may also result in a cash outflow or inflow for the Company are known as contingencies. Contingencies are not guaranteed, and they heavily rely on the occurrence or lack thereof, of uncertain future events.\nValue Added Tax (VAT)\nThe Company is subject to VAT, which is levied on a majority of the products, at a rate ranging from 9% to 13% on the invoiced value of sales depending on the type of products sold. The output VAT is borne by customers in addition to the invoiced value of sales and input VAT is borne by the Company in addition to the invoiced value of purchases.\nThe VAT may be offset by VAT paid by the Company on raw materials and other materials included in the cost of producing or acquiring its finished products. Further, when exporting goods, the exporter is entitled to some or all of the refund of the VAT paid or assessed.\nVAT returns of the Company are subject to examination by the tax authorities for five years from the date of filing.\nIncome Tax\nIncome tax returns are filed in federal, state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for current income taxes are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the income tax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions and provisions for uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the consolidated financial statement bases and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities associated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income tax expense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are charged or credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferred tax assets when realization is less than more likely than not.\nLiabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in income tax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technical merits of the positions. Additionally, liabilities may be established for uncertain tax positions when, in our judgment, the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, but the position does not rise to the level of certain based upon the technical merits of the position. The Company did not incur any interest and penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and also did not anticipate any significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months from June 30, 2022.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe assets and liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries outside the U.S. are translated into U.S. dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet dates, primarily from RMB. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Gains and losses resulting from currency transactions are recognized currently in income and those resulting from translation of consolidated financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe value of RMB against US$ fluctuates. Any significant revaluation of RMB may materially affect the Companys financial condition in terms of US$ reporting. The following table outlines the currency exchange rates used in creating the CFS in this report:\nSchedule of Foreign Currencies Translation\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nPeriod-end spot rate US $1=RMB 6.6981 US $1=RMB 6.4566\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nYear Ended\nJune 30,\nAverage rate US $1=RMB 6.4554 US $1=RMB 6.6221\nEarnings (Loss) Per Share\nThe Company computes net earnings (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted net earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the statement of operations. Basic EPS is computed by dividing earnings (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU), ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions within ASC 740, Income Taxes, and clarifies certain aspects of ASC 740 to promote consistency among reporting entities. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. Most amendments within the standard are required to be applied on a prospective basis, while certain amendments must be applied on a retrospective or modified retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12, and it did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments in this Update eliminate the accounting guidance for TDRs by creditors in Subtopic 310-40, Receivables-Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors, while enhancing disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancings and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Specifically, rather than applying the re cognition and measurement guidance for TDRs, an entity must apply the loan refinancing and restructuring guidance in paragraphs 310-20-35-9 through 35-11 to determine whether a modification results in a new loan or a continuation of an existing loan. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update require that an entity disclose current-period gross write offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of Subtopic 326-20, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses-Measured at Amortized Cost. For entities that have adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For entities that have not yet adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13, the effective dates for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective dates in Update 2016-13. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively, except as provided in the next sentence. For the transition method related to the recognition and measurement of TDRs, an entity has the option to apply a modified retrospective transition method, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted if an entity has adopted the amendments in Update 2016-13, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity elects to early adopt the amendments in this Update in an interim period, the guidance should be applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. An entity may elect to early adopt the amendments about TDRs and related disclosure enhancements separately from the amendments related to vintage disclosures. The Company evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2022-02, and it did not have any impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company will adopt ASU 2022-02 effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022.\nNote 4 - Advance to Suppliers\nOn February 2, 2022, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with an unrelated party, which is the Companys major supplier.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedure include, without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuers management, including its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn accordance with Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by the Companys Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companys disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on that evaluation, the Companys sole officer concluded that the Companys disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in providing reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Companys reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the companys board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\u25cf Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Because of the inherent limitations of internal control, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.\nAs of June 30, 2022, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; (3) ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes; and (4) ineffective controls over idenfification of related party relationships and proper disclosure of related parties transactions and balances. The aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our management in connection with the review of our financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2022.\nManagement believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results. However, management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods.\nThis Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Managements report was not subject to attestation by our registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only the managements report in this annual report.\nManagements Remediation Initiatives\nOn August 15, 2022, the Board established an Audit Committee, a Nominating Committee, and a Compensation Committee, and it further adopted Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nDuring the last quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on the Effectiveness of Controls.\nA control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. ITEM 9B.
