    "content": "ITEM 1. BUSINESS\nCorporate History and Overview\nWe were first incorporated in Nevada as Surf A Movie Solutions, Inc. on December 18, 2007 to engage in the business of the development sale and marketing of online video sales. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business. Since that time and until August 8, 2014, we were a shell company (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act).\nOn August 30, 2013, we changed our name to Frac Water Systems, Inc. and on October 10, 2013 we decided to engage in the business of providing economically and environmentally sound solutions for the treatment and recycling of wastewater resulting principally from oil and gas exploration and production activities. Due to our research of the business opportunities, on December 31, 2013 we determined not to move forward with this line of business.\nIn early March 2014, we decided to enter into the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical level products containing phytocannabinnoids, an abundant and pharmaceutically active component of industrial hemp, for the prevention and alleviation of various conditions and diseases. In connection therewith, on March 17, 2014, we changed our name to Cannabis Therapy Corporation and on March 24, 2014 changed our trading symbol on OTC Markets to CTCO. On December 23, 2014, we changed our name to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our trading symbol changed to PKPH on February 5, 2015.\nIn March 2014 we began operating as a bio-pharmaceutical and nutraceutical company seeking to develop, manufacture, market and sell safe, high quality, medicinal products based on extracts from hemp. Our primary initial focus was on exploitation of the exclusive license we received from Canna-Pet, LLC, a developer of ingestible health products for pets made from hemp. We had also taken initial steps related to development of over-the-counter, THC-free, hemp-based products for the human market for the prevention and alleviation of symptoms associated with inflammatory and auto-immune diseases.\nOn July 29, 2014, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp., we entered into a License Agreement (the License Agreement) with Canna-Pet, LLC, (Licensor) a Washington limited liability corporation. They own the brand name Canna-Pet and certain related intellectual property including, but not limited to, trademarks and copyrights, formulations, recipes, production processes and systems, websites, domain names, customer lists, supplier lists, trade secrets and know-how, and other related intellectual property (collectively, the Licensed Intellectual Property). This is used by the Licensor in the conduct of its business related to the production and sale of medical products made from industrial hemp, which are intended exclusively for consumption by pets. Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Licensor granted to us a perpetual, exclusive, world-wide license to use the Licensed Intellectual Property in conjunction with our business and the production and sale of medical products made from industrial hemp, as well as the right to sublicense the Licensed Intellectual Property to third parties. The License Agreement gave us the right to produce and sell existing products utilizing the Licensed Intellectual Property and to develop new products, jointly with Licensor or otherwise, based upon the Licensed Intellectual Property. The License Agreement provided us with an immediate revenue source and access to Licensors customer base. The License Agreement specified that during the term of the license, all intellectual property rights in and to the Licensed Intellectual Property remain the exclusive property of Licensor.\nIn consideration of the grant of the license, we agreed to pay Licensor license fees in the form of royalty payments calculated based on gross proceeds received by us from sales of products manufactured, marketed or sold by us utilizing the Licensed Intellectual Property or any subsequently developed intellectual property which is jointly owned by us and Licensor. We began selling Canna-Pet products in October 2014.\nBased upon recent regulatory activity related to imposition of restrictions and limitations on the sale of hemp-based health products for pets, we elected to terminate our license agreement with the Licensor, effective as of October 1, 2015, and to cease all operations relating to sale of hemp-based products for pets.\nOn October 12, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the termination (Termination Agreement) of the License Agreement, effectively selling the discontinued operations. The Termination Agreement contained the following provisions:\n\u25cf Termination of License: The parties agreed to terminate the License Agreement effective as of October 1, 2015, this termination was made by mutual agreement of the parties pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of the License Agreement.\n\u25cf Return of Licensed Intellectual Property: We agreed to return all Licensed Intellectual Property to the Licensor, and our right to use all, or any portion, of the Licensed Intellectual Property ceased effective as of October 1, 2015, Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, the Licensed Intellectual Property included the brand name Canna-Pet and certain related intellectual property, including, but not limited, trademarks and copyrights, formulations, recipes, production processes and systems, websites, domain names, customer lists, supplier lists trade secrets and know- how, and other related intellectual property.\n\u25cf Return of Other Property: In addition to return of the Licensed Intellectual Property, we agreed to transfer to Licensor all product inventory, Colorado hemp with permits and authorization, all production/fulfillment contracts, all e-commerce accounts and processing, all non-disclosure and research agreements and any and all other property in our possession which was used by us in the conduct of our business related to production and sale of medical cannabis products for pets made from hemp and low-THC cannabis plants.\n\u25cf Office Space, Equipment and Employees: In conjunction with the execution of the Termination Agreement, we granted the Licensor the right to use our office space, for the three-month period from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, on a rent-free basis.\n\u25cf Consideration: As consideration for the cancellation of the License Agreement and the return of other property, as described above, the Licensor agreed to waive payment by us and to release us from liability for payment of any and all unpaid royalties, invoices and other amounts which were otherwise currently due and payable by us to Licensor for sales of Canna-Pet products for all periods through and including September 30, 2015.\n\u25cf Collections: On October 15, 2015, we forwarded to the Licensor all payments received by us after September 30, 2015 (net of amounts received by us for taxes, duties, governmental charges, freight or shipping charges, and the like) for Canna-Pet products sold on or after October 1, 2015.\nFurthermore, based on advice from the Food and Drug Administration, as well as our regulatory counsel, we decided to revise our strategy and discontinue all efforts to develop and market hemp-based health products. We currently are attempting to acquire or merge with an entity with significant operations in order to create a viable business model and value for our shareholders. Since October 2015 we have been a shell company (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act).\nAll of our business operations are carried out through our wholly owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp., a Colorado corporation. Throughout this Report, unless otherwise noted or required by the context, references to the Company, us, we, our, and similar terms refer to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp.\nWe currently have authorized 325,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of blank check Preferred Stock.\nOn August 15, 2012, our board of directors and stockholders owning a majority of our outstanding common shares, authorized a 50 for 1 forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. The forward split became effective on September 27, 2012. Due to the forward split, each outstanding share was split into 50 shares. On March 11, 2014, our board of directors authorized a 1.5 for 1 forward stock split of our common stock in the form of a dividend. In connection therewith, our shareholders of record as of the close of business on March 28, 2014 received an additional 0.5 share of our common stock for each share of our issued and outstanding common stock held by them on such date. The forward stock split became effective on April 1, 2014.\nStrategy and Outlook\nIf we can raise sufficient capital, of which there can be no assurance, our business strategy is to actively pursue additional opportunities and operating companies to merge with or acquire in furtherance of a profitable business and to build value for our shareholders.\nEmployees\nAs of the date of this report we have no employees. Neil Reithinger, our sole and principal executive officer has no employment agreement with Company and receives no compensation in his capacity.\nSubsidiaries\nAll of our business operations historically had been carried on through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp., a Colorado corporation.\nIntellectual Property\nWe do not presently own any intellectual property.\nGovernment Regulation\nBased upon the regulatory activity related to imposition of restrictions and limitations on the sale and marketing of hemp-based health products for the veterinary market, on October 1, 2015, we elected to terminate our license agreement with Canna-Pet and cease all operations relating to sale of hemp-based products for animals. Furthermore, based on advice from the Food and Drug Administration, as well as our regulatory counsel, we decided to revise our strategy and discontinue all efforts to develop and market hemp-based health products. As a result, we are currently not subject to any government regulation. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Companys common stock involves a number of very significant risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors included in the Risk Factors section below, in addition to other information contained in this report in evaluating the Company and its business before purchasing shares of its common stock. The Companys business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected due to any of those risks.\nSummary Risk Factors\nThe principal factors and uncertainties that make investing in our ordinary shares risky, include, among others:\nRisks Related to Our Company\n&cir; We have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects. We may never attain profitability.\n&cir; We have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\n&cir; We will require additional working capital in order to continue operations and we may not be able to secure the necessary additional financing.\n&cir; Our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Investment\n&cir; You may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\n&cir; We may be unable to raise enough capital through sales of our equity and debt securities to implement our business plan.\n&cir; The ability of our Board to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\n&cir; Restrictions on the use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies could affect your ability to resale our shares.\n&cir; Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\n&cir; We do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\n&cir; If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.\n&cir; We may be subject to proposed SEC rules and amendments.\nRisks Related to Our Company\nWe have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our future prospects. We may never attain profitability.\nGiven our limited operating history, management has little basis on which to forecast future demand for our products and out anticipated revenues. Our anticipated and future expense levels are based largely on estimates of planned operations and future revenues rather than experience.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may not achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in each fiscal year since our incorporation in 2007. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we continue to explore operating companies to merge with or acquire. These efforts may prove more expensive than we currently anticipate, and we may not succeed in generating sufficient revenues to offset these higher expenses. If we are unable to do so, we and our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe will require additional working capital in order to continue operations and we may not be able to secure the necessary additional financing.\nWe will require additional working capital in order to continue to remain compliant under the Exchange Act and to continue to explore future business opportunities. We cannot be sure that this additional financing, if needed, will be available on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating flexibility with respect to business matters. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced, our shareholders may experience additional dilution in net book value, and such equity securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our existing shareholders. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, or at all, we will be unable to develop or enhance our products and services, take advantage of future opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur historical financial statements have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report that included an explanatory paragraph referring to our recurring net losses and accumulated deficit and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to merge or acquire an operating business and obtain additional equity or debt financing or other capital and, ultimately, to generate revenue. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. However, if adequate funds are not available to us when we need it, and we are unable to find an operating company to merge with or acquire, we will be required to curtail our operations which would, in turn, further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nRisks Related to Investment\nYou may experience dilution of your ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock.\nAny future issuance of our equity or equity-backed securities may dilute then current stockholders ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. As described above, we may need to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common or preferred stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common or preferred stock. We may also issue such securities related to hiring or retaining employees and consultants as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions or for other business purposes. Our Board may at any time authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock without common stockholder approval, subject only to the total number of authorized common and preferred shares set forth in our articles of incorporation. The terms of equity securities issued by us in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of common or preferred stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price (or exercise prices) below the price at which shares of our common stock are then traded.\nWe may be unable to raise enough capital through sales of our equity and debt securities to implement our business plan.\nWe will be largely dependent on capital raised through sales of our equity and debt securities. Currently, we have not made any arrangements to raise additional cash, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the working capital as needed on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise capital as needed, we will be unable to continue operations or to implement our business plan and will be required to cease our operations entirely.\nThe ability of our Board to issue additional stock may prevent or make more difficult certain transactions, including a sale or merger of the Company.\nWe currently have authorized 325,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock, and (ii) 25,000,000 shares of blank check Preferred Stock. As a result, our Board is authorized to issue up to 25,000,000 shares of preferred stock with powers, rights and preferences designated by it. See Preferred Stock in the section of this Report titled Description of Securities. Shares of voting or convertible preferred stock could be issued, or rights to purchase such shares could be issued, to create voting impediments or to frustrate persons seeking to affect a takeover or otherwise gain control of the Company. The ability of the Board to issue such additional shares of Preferred Stock, with rights and preferences it deems advisable, could discourage an attempt by a party to acquire control of the Company by tender offer or other means. Such issuances could therefore deprive stockholders of benefits that could result from such an attempt, such as the realization of a premium over the market price for their shares in a tender offer or the temporary increase in market price that such an attempt could cause. Moreover, the issuance of such additional shares of preferred stock to persons friendly to the Board could make it more difficult to remove incumbent managers and directors from office even if such change were to be favorable to stockholders generally.\nRestrictions on the use of Rule 144 by Shell Companies or Former Shell Companies could affect your ability to resale our shares.\nHistorically, the SEC has taken the position that Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as amended, is not available for the resale of securities initially issued by companies that are, or previously were, shell companies like us, to their promoters or affiliates despite technical compliance with the requirements of Rule 144. The SEC has codified and expanded this position in its amendments to Rule 144 which became effective on February 15, 2008, the amendments apply to securities acquired both before and after that date, by prohibiting the use of Rule 144 for resale of securities issued by shell companies (other than business transaction related shell companies) or issuers that have been at any time previously a shell company unless all of the following conditions are met:\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities that was formerly a shell company has ceased to be a shell company\u037e\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act\u037e\n\u25cf the issuer of the securities has filed all Exchange Act reports and material required to be filed, as applicable, during the preceding 12 months (or such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials), other than Form 8-K reports\u037e and\n\u25cf at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current Form 10 type information with the SEC reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company.\nShould we fail to satisfy the initial listing standards of the national exchanges, or our common stock is otherwise rejected for listing and remains listed on the OTC Markets or suspended from the OTC Markets, the trading price of our common stock could suffer and the trading market for our common stock may be less liquid, and our common stock price may be subject to increased volatility.\nOur common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the SEC and the trading market in the securities is limited, which makes transactions in the stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in the stock.\nThe SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a penny stock, for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:\n\u25cf that a broker or dealer approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks\u037e and\n\u25cf the broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a persons account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must:\n\u25cf obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person\u037e and\n\u25cf make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form sets forth:\n\u25cf the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination\u037e and\n\u25cf that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.\nGenerally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of common stock and cause a decline in the market value of stock.\nDisclosure also must be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our securities. If our securities are subject to the penny stock rules, investors will find it more difficult to dispose of our securities.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock, and investors may lose the entire amount of their investment.\nTo date, cash dividends have not been declared or paid on our common stock, and we do not anticipate such a declaration or payment for the foreseeable future. We expect to use future earnings, if any, to fund business growth. Therefore, stockholders will not receive any funds absent a sale of their shares of common stock, subject to the limitation outlined herein. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates. We cannot assure stockholders of a positive return on their investment when they sell their shares, nor can we assure that stockholders will not lose the entire amount of their investment.\nWe do not have an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, and may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our Common Stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management is required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are a shell company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could detect problems that our managements assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could lead to restatements of our financial statements and require us to incur the expense of remediation. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES\nOur principal executive offices are located at 14201 N. Hayden Road, Suite A-1, Scottsdale, AZ 85260. Our registered agent is Nevada Agency and Transfer Company, 50 West Liberty Street, Suite 880 Reno, NV 89501.\nWe believe that our facilities are generally in good condition and suitable to carry on our business. We also believe that, if required, suitable alternative or additional space will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nFrom time to time, we may become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm business. We are currently not aware of any pending legal proceedings to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject, nor are we aware of any such proceedings that are contemplated by any governmental authority. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMarket Information\nOur shares of common stock are quoted on the OTC Markets, Pink Tier, under the symbol PKPH. On December 16, 2022, the closing price of our common stock reported by the OTC Markets was $0.044 per share.\nTransfer Agent\nThe transfer agent and registrar for our common stock is Securities Transfer Corporation, 2901 North Dallas Parkway, Suite 380, Plano, Texas 75093. Their phone number is (469) 633-0101 and their website is www.stctransfer.com.\nHolders of Common Stock\nAs of the date of this report, we have 78,363,567 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by approximately 19 stockholders of record.\nRegistration Rights\nThere were no registration rights as of September 30, 2020.\nDividends\nWe have never paid any cash dividends on our capital stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We intend to retain future earnings to fund ongoing operations and future capital requirements. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will be dependent upon financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board deems relevant.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nThere were no equity compensation plans formally approved by the shareholders of the Company as of September 30, 2020.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we undertook no sales of unregistered securities.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we did not repurchase any of our equity securities. ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCautionary Notice Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nThe information contained in Item 7 contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Actual results may materially differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements because of certain risks and uncertainties set forth in this report. Although management believes that the assumptions made, and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, there is no assurance that the underlying assumptions will, in fact, prove to be correct or that actual results will not be different from expectations expressed in this report.\nWe desire to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This filing contains a number of forward-looking statements that reflect managements current views and expectations with respect to our business, strategies, products, future results and events, and financial performance. All statements made in this filing other than statements of historical fact, including statements addressing operating performance, clinical developments which management expects or anticipates will or may occur in the future, including statements related to our technology, market expectations, future revenues, financing alternatives, statements expressing general optimism about future operating results, and non-historical information, are forward looking statements. In particular, the words believe, expect, intend, anticipate, estimate, may, variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements, and their absence does not mean that the statement is not forward-looking. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from historical results as well as those expressed in, anticipated, or implied by these forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to revise these forward-looking statements to reflect any future events or circumstances.\nReaders should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are based on managements current expectations and projections about future events. They are not guarantees of future performance, they are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions (including those described below), and apply only as of the date of this filing. Our actual results, performance or achievements could differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward-looking statements. Factors which could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, the risks to be discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, information in press releases, and other communications to shareholders issued by us from time to time. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nUse of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) Financial Measures\nWe use United States GAAP financial measures in the section of this report captioned Managements Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation (MD&A), unless otherwise noted. All the GAAP financial measures used by us in this report relate to the inclusion of financial information. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report. All references to dollar amounts in this section are in United States dollars, unless expressly stated otherwise. Please see our Risk Factors for a list of our risk factors.\nOverview\nThis subsection of MD&A provides an overview of the important factors that management focuses on in evaluating our businesses, financial condition and operating performance, our overall business strategy and our financial results for the periods covered.\nGoing Concern\nThe consolidated financial statements contained in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company had cumulative net losses through September 30, 2020 of $5,113,498, as well as negative cash flows of $119 from operating activities. The Companys cash and cash equivalents balance as of September 30, 2020 was $408. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nWhile we will actively seek to identify sources of liquidity, there are no assurances that such additional sources of liquidity can be obtained on terms acceptable to us on a commercially reasonable basis, or at all. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Furthermore, our going concern and lack of commercial operations may make it more difficult for us to raise funds.\nThe consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Companys continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing as may be required and ultimately to attain profitability. If the Company raises additional funds through the issuance of equity, the percentage ownership of current shareholders could be reduced, and such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to its common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, the Company may not be able to take advantage of prospective business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict its future plans for developing its business and achieving commercial revenues. If the Company is unable to obtain the necessary capital, the Company may have to cease operations.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2020 to the Fiscal Years Ended September 30, 2019\nRevenue\nNo revenue or cost of sales were generated for the years ended September 30, 2020 or September 30, 2019\nOperating Expenses\nThe Companys expenses for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, are summarized as follows:\nYears ended September 30,\nGeneral and administrative (including $783 and $1,252 of fees paid to related party) $ 5,535 $ 5,684\nTotal operating expenses $ 5,535 $ 5,684\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended September 30, 2020, compared to the year ended September 30, 2019 of $149 is due primarily to a decrease in accounting fees.\nOther Expenses\nYears ended September 30,\nInterest Expense $ 9,476 $ 8,309\nTotal other expenses $ 9,476 $ 8,309\nInterest expense increased by $1,167 for the year ended September 30, 2020 from the comparative period of 2019 due to the increase in interest rate to 15% on the Companys notes payable due to the default rate provisions.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in working capital for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nYears ended September 30,\nCurrent Assets $ 408 $ 527\nCurrent Liabilities 250,504 235,612\nWorking capital $ (250,096 ) $ (235,085 )\nThe decrease in current assets of $119 is mainly due to a decrease in cash from the payment of outstanding bills during the year ended September 30, 2020. The increase in current liabilities of $14,892 is due primarily to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in cash flows for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:\nYears Ended September 30,\nNet cash used in operating activities $ (119 ) $ (1,743 )\nChange in cash $ (119 ) $ (1,743 )\nAs of September 30, 2020, our cash balance was $408. The Company does not expect its current cash and operating income to be sufficient to meet its financial needs for continuing operations over the next twelve months.\nNet cash used in operations for the year ended September 30, 2020 was $119 due primarily to the net loss that was incurred during the year.\nWe may need to evaluate raising additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through an offering of debt securities or through borrowing from individuals. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nCash Requirements\nAs of the date of this filing, we do not have sufficient cash on hand to cover our operating expenses through the next fiscal year. As of December 16, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $97,000. During the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company received an aggregate of $275,000 related to the issuance of 14 notes payable to various noteholders, including an aggregate of $35,000 as a result of two notes payable issued to the Companys Chief Executive Officer, a related party. The notes are unsecured, bear interest at 1.5% per annum, and mature on September 30, 2021. There can be no assurance, however, that additional financing will be available or, if it is available, that we will be able to structure such financing on terms acceptable to us and that it will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements until we can reach a level of profitable operations and positive cash flows. Even if we are able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash requirements that would force us to seek additional financing. If additional financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms, we will have to curtail our operations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.\nEffects of Inflation\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, revenues or operating results during the periods presented.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.\nWe regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, managements estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 740, Accounting for Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in their financial statements, uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740, tax positions must initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities. Such tax positions must initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nWe review convertible notes payable and the related subscription agreements to determine the appropriate reporting within the financial statements. We report convertible notes payable as liabilities at their carrying value less unamortized discounts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We bifurcate conversion options and report them as liabilities at fair value at each reporting period when required in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. No gain or loss is reported when the notes are converted into shares of our common stock in accordance with the notes terms.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nOn August 5, 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The ASUs amendments are effective for public business entities that are not smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be early adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies income tax accounting in various areas including, but not limited to, the accounting for hybrid tax regimes, tax implications related to business combinations, and interim period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, along with some codification improvements. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2018-13), which eliminates certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements for all entities, requires public entities to disclose certain new information and modifies some disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures upon issuance of ASU 2018-13. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on October 1, 2020 and has determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessees right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This ASU leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the assets leased to the lessee (lessor) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019 and has determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nNot applicable. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nThe information called for by Item 8 is included following the Index to Financial Statements on page contained in this annual report on Form 10-K. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nOn March 17, 2017, we engaged Dale Matheson Carr-Hilton Labonte LLP (DMCL) as our independent registered public accounting firm. Effective February 21, 2021, we dismissed DMCL as our independent registered public accounting firm engaged to audit our consolidated financial statements and engaged Friedman LLP (Friedman) as the Companys independent registered public accounting firm.\nThrough the reporting periods ended September 30, 2017, there have been no disagreements with DMCL on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction of DMCL would have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the financial statements. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, we performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report (the Evaluation Date). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer who is also our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.\nWe do not have an audit committee. While we are not currently obligated to have an audit committee, including a member who is an audit committee financial expert, as defined in Item 407 of Regulation S-K, under applicable regulations or listing standards; however, it is managements view that such a committee is an important internal control over financial reporting, the lack of which may result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of internal controls and procedures.\nBased on this evaluation, we determined that as of September 30, 2020, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the following:\n\u25cf We do not have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors, which may result in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures.\n\u25cf We have an inadequate number of personnel to properly implement control procedures.\n\u25cf Due to the size and lack of resources of our Company, we have not fully developed formal accounting policies and procedures.\n\u25cf We have not properly complied with all aspects of the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs of September 30, 2020, management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that evaluation, they concluded that during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to detect the inappropriate application of US GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design or operation of our internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected our internal controls and that may be considered to be material weaknesses.\nThe matters involving internal controls and procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses were:\n(i) lack of a functioning audit committee;\n(ii) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and\n(iii) ineffective controls over period-end financial disclosure and reporting processes.\nThe aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by our Chief Executive and Financial Officer in connection with the review of our financial statements as of September 30, 2020.\nManagement believes the weaknesses identified above have not had any material effect on our financial statements. However, we are currently reviewing our disclosure controls and procedures related to these material weaknesses and expect to implement changes as soon as practicable and as resources allow, including identifying specific areas within our governance, accounting and financial reporting processes to add adequate resources to remediate these material weaknesses.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagements Remediation Plan\nSubject to raising additional working capital, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial reporting. During the period covered by this annual report on Form 10-K, we have not been able to remediate the material weaknesses identified above. To remediate such weaknesses, we plan to implement the following changes in the next fiscal year once we have identified a suitable business to acquire and as our capital resources allow:\n(i) appoint additional qualified personnel to address inadequate segregation of duties and ineffective risk management and implement modifications to our financial controls to address such inadequacies;\n(ii) adopt sufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting; and\n(iii) appoint independent board members and a functioning audit committee.\nThe remediation efforts set out in (i) is largely dependent upon our company identifying and acquiring a suitable operating business and securing additional financing to cover the costs of hiring the requisite personnel and implementing the changes required. If we are unsuccessful in such endeavors, remediation efforts may be delayed. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.\nManagement believes that despite our material weaknesses set forth above, our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2020 are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with US GAAP.

Eventus provides accounting and advisory services to the Company in connection with audit coordination, financial statement preparation and SEC filings. The Company pays customary fees for these services. During the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred fees to Eventus of $783 and $1,252, respectively, and owed Eventus $13,143 and $12,360, respectively, as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.

The following table sets forth the fees billed to the Company for professional services rendered by DMCL and for Friedman for each of the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively:\nFriedman\nServices\nAudit fees $ 15,000 $ 15,000\nAudit related fees - -\nTax fees - -\nAll other fees - -\nTotal fees $ 15,000 $ 15,000\nAudit Fees\nThe audit fees were paid for the audit services of our annual and quarterly reports.\nPre-Approval Policies and Procedures\nOur sole director preapproves all services provided by our independent registered public accounting firm.

(the Company) as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders deficit, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nSubstantial Doubt about the Companys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,113,498 and a working capital deficiency of $250,096 as of September 30, 2020. During the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company incurred a net loss of $15,011 and used cash in operating activities of $119. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had cash of $408. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements evaluation of the events and conditions and managements plans regarding those matters also are described in Note 2. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. Our opinion is not modified with respect to that matter.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audits of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n/s/ Friedman LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2021.\nMarlton, New Jersey\nDecember 19, 2022\nPEAK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSeptember 30, September 30,\nAssets\nCurrent assets:\nCash $ 408 $ 527\nTotal Assets $ 408 $ 527\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nCurrent liabilities\nAccounts payable (including $88,020 and $87,237 due to related parties) $ 162,532 $ 157,117\nAccrued liabilities 24,972 15,495\nConvertible notes payable 20,000 20,000\nNote payable 43,000 43,000\nTotal Liabilities 250,504 235,612\nStockholders deficit\nPreferred stock, $0.0001 par value, 25,000,000 authorized, none issued or outstanding - -\nCommon stock, $0.0001 par value, 300,000,000 shares authorized, 78,363,567 shares issued and outstanding 7,836 7,836\nAdditional paid in capital 4,855,566 4,855,566\nAccumulated deficit (5,113,498 ) (5,098,487 )\nTotal Stockholders Deficit (250,096 ) (235,085 )\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders Deficit $ 408 $ 527\nThe accompanying footnotes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPEAK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the Twelve Months Ended\nSeptember 30,\nOperating expenses:\nGeneral and administrative (including fees paid to related party of $783 and $1,252) $ 5,535 $ 5,684\nTotal operating expenses 5,535 5,684\nOperating loss (5,535 ) (5,684 )\nOther expenses:\nInterest expense (9,476 ) (8,309 )\nTotal other expenses (9,476 ) (8,309 )\nNet loss $ (15,011 ) $ (13,993 )\nPer share information:\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic and diluted 78,363,567 78,363,567\nNet loss per share - basic and diluted $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 )\nThe accompanying footnotes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPEAK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF STOCKHOLDERS DEFICIT\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 and 2019\nCommon Stock Additional Paid Accumulated\nShares Amount In Capital Deficit Total\nBalance, September 30, 2018 78,363,567 $ 7,836 $ 4,855,566 $ (5,084,494 ) $ (221,092 )\nNet loss - - - (13,993 ) (13,993 )\nBalance, September 30, 2019 78,363,567 $ 7,836 $ 4,855,566 $ (5,098,487 ) $ (235,085 )\nNet loss - - - (15,011 ) (15,011 )\nBalance, September 30, 2020 78,363,567 $ 7,836 $ 4,855,566 $ (5,113,498 ) $ (250,096 )\nThe accompanying footnotes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPEAK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020 and 2019\nCash flows from operating activities:\nNet loss $ (15,011 ) $ (13,993 )\nAdjustment to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities:\nAccounts payable 4,632 1,766\nAccounts payable - related parties 2,175\nAccrued expenses 9,477 8,309\nNet cash used in operating activities (119 ) (1,743 )\nNet change in cash (119 ) (1,743 )\nCash, beginning of year 2,270\nCash, end of year $ 408 $ 527\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information\nCash paid for interest $ - $ -\nCash paid for income taxes $ - $ -\nThe accompanying footnotes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nPEAK PHARMACEUTICALS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020\nNOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company was incorporated in Nevada on December 18, 2007. After a number of name changes, we again, changed our name to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. on December 23, 2014. This name was consistent with our business operations and plans relating to development, manufacturing and marketing of hemp-based nutraceutical and supplement products for the human and animal health markets. On October 1, 2015, we discontinued certain operations of the Company.\nThe Company is currently a shell company (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act).\nThroughout this report, the terms our, we, us, and the Company refer to Peak Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Peak BioPharma Corp.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and our wholly owned subsidiary Peak BioPharma Corp. All inter-company balances and transactions among the companies have been eliminated upon consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant estimates made in connection with the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets and accounting for convertible debt.\nFinancial Instruments\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, notes payable and convertible notes. The carrying values of these instruments approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820), provides a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures which are required about fair value measurements. Specifically, ASC 820 sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs. ASC 820 defines the hierarchy as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices.\nLevel 2 - Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts or priced with models using highly observable inputs.\nLevel 3 - Significant inputs to pricing that are unobservable as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation, such as complex and subjective models and forecasts used to determine the fair value of financial transmission rights.\nIn some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nLoss Per Share\nWe calculate net loss per share in accordance with ASC Topic 260, Earnings per Share. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period, and diluted earnings per share is computed by including common stock equivalents outstanding for the period in the denominator. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, any equivalents would have been anti-dilutive as we had net losses for the periods then ended.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had two convertible notes with principal and accrued interest balances totaling $29,366 and $26,357, respectively. The note holders are entitled, at their option, to convert all or a part of their options at the date into shares of the of common stock in the Company at a price equal to a 20% discount to the closing price of the common stock on the date of the lenders notice of conversion, subject to a floor of $0.01. These common stock equivalents of approximately 3,058,935 and 2,745,572 shares for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nAs of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had 3,291,000 in stock options outstanding which are exercisable at the holders option, with an exercise price of $0.0067, which are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS as their effect would be anti-dilutive.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2020, the Company does not have any cash equivalents.\nConvertible Notes Payable\nWe review convertible notes payable and the related subscription agreements to determine the appropriate reporting within the financial statements. We report convertible notes payable as liabilities at their carrying value less unamortized discounts in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We bifurcate conversion options and report them as liabilities at fair value at each reporting period when required in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance. We had no such liabilities as of September 30, 2020 and 2019. No gain or loss is reported when the notes are converted into shares of our common stock in accordance with the notes terms.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company records income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and attributable to operating loss carryforwards. The carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning alternatives. The Company assesses the likelihood that uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the applicable taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. Tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period, including interest and penalties, and are recognized during the period in which the change occurs. This evaluation is required to be performed for all open tax years, as defined by the various statutes of limitations, for federal and state purposes. For the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, we did not have any interest and penalties or any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in operating expenses.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nManagement does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Companys financial statements.\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued that we adopt as of the specified effective date. We believe that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective may have an impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nOn August 5, 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40, which simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entitys own equity. The ASUs amendments are effective for public business entities that are not smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The guidance may be early adopted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes (Topic 740), (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies income tax accounting in various areas including, but not limited to, the accounting for hybrid tax regimes, tax implications related to business combinations, and interim period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, along with some codification improvements. ASU 2019-12 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13). ASU 2016-13 amends the guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. This update adds an impairment model (known as the current expected credit losses model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes, as an allowance, its estimate of expected credit losses. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2019-10 changes the effective date of the credit loss standard (ASU 2016-13) to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years for smaller reporting companies. Further, the ASU clarifies that operating lease receivables are not within the scope of ASC 326-20 and should instead be accounted for under the new leasing standard, ASC 842. The Company has determined that the adoption of this guidance has no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement (ASU 2018-13), which eliminates certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements for all entities, requires public entities to disclose certain new information and modifies some disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for any eliminated or modified disclosures upon issuance of ASU 2018-13. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 on October 1, 2020 and has determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. This ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on its balance sheet for all leases with terms of more than twelve months. A lease liability is a lessees obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset represents the lessees right to use, or control use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments in this ASU simplify the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. This ASU leaves the accounting for the organizations that own the assets leased to the lessee (lessor) largely unchanged except for targeted improvements to align it with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on October 1, 2019 and has determined that the adoption of this guidance had no impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN AND MANAGEMENTS LIQUIDITY PLANS\nAs of September 30, 2020, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $5,113,498 and a working capital deficiency of $250,096. During year ended September 30, 2020, the Company used cash in operating activities of $119. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had cash of $408. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The Company recognizes it will need to raise additional capital in order to fund operations and meet its payment obligations. There is no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or that management will be able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to the Company and whether the Company will generate revenues, become profitable and generate positive operating cash flow. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds on favorable terms, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables and to raise capital through the issuance of debt or equity on less favorable terms until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.\nAccordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The carrying amounts of assets and liabilities presented in the consolidated financial statements do not necessarily represent realizable or settlement values. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nNOTE 3 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nParties, which can be corporations or individuals, are considered to be related if they have the ability, directly or indirectly, to control the other party or exercise significant influence over the other party in making financial and operating decisions. Companies are also considered to be related if they are subject to common control or common significant influence.\nAccounts payable - related parties are amounts payable to current and former officers and directors for services provided to the Company totaling $88,020 and $87,237, as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts include accounts payable to an entity controlled by our sole officer and director for financial services such entity is incurring on behalf of the Company totaling $13,143 and $12,360, as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, Total expense incurred related to this entity was $783 and $1,252 for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, with no other related party expenses incurred.\nNOTE 4 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND NOTES PAYABLE\nConvertible Notes Payable\nLoan with Trius Holdings Limited\nOn March 17, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with Trius Holdings Limited (Trius). Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Trius acquired a 12% convertible note with an aggregate face value of $10,000. The note matures in one year and is unsecured. Trius is entitled, at its option, to convert all or a part of the principal outstanding at the date into shares of the of common stock in the Company at a price equal to a 20% discount to the closing price of the common stock on the date of the lenders notice of conversion, subject to a floor of $0.01. On May 11, 2018, the agreement had been amended to extend the maturing date of the note from March 21, 2018 to March 21, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, the total balance and accrued interest owing under this note was $10,000 and $$4,705, respectively. As of the date of this report, that date has not been extended, and the Company is accruing interest at the default interest rate of 15%.\nLoan with Individual\nOn March 30, 2017, the Company entered into an agreement with an individual. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the individual acquired a 12% convertible note with an aggregate face value of $10,000. The note matures in one year and is unsecured. The individual is entitled, at its option, to convert all or a part of the principal outstanding at the date into shares of the of common stock in the Company at a price equal to a 20% discount to the closing price of the common stock on the date of the lenders notice of conversion, subject to a floor of $0.01. The default interest rate is 15%. On May 11, 2018, the agreement had been amended to extend the maturing date of the note from March 30, 2018 to March 30, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, the total balance and accrued interest owing under this note was $10,000 and $4,660, respectively. Subsequent to the year ended September 30, 2020, on December 3, 2021, the Company repaid this loan and accrued interest in full.\nNotes Payable\nLoan with Mediapark Investments Limited\nOn January 10, 2018, the Company entered into an agreement with Mediapark Investments Limited (Mediapark.) Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Mediapark acquired a 12% promissory note with an aggregate face value of $23,000. The note matures in 180 days on July 10, 2018 and is unsecured. As of July 9, 2018, the loan was extended to July 10, 2019. As of September 30, 2020, the total balance and accrued interest owing under this note was $23,000 and $8,363, respectively.

After consideration of all the evidence, both positive and negative, management has determined that a full valuation allowance at September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, is necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The change in valuation allowance was an increase of approximately $4,000 and $3,000 for the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2020, we have a net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $1,139,000 (2019: $1,124,000). The loss will be available to offset future taxable income. If not used, these carry forwards will expire in varying amounts through 2038.\nThere are open statutes of limitations for taxing authorities in federal and state jurisdictions to audit our tax returns from 2015 through the current period. Our policy is to account for income tax related interest and penalties in income tax expense in the statement of operations. There have been no income tax related interest or penalties assessed or recorded.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 we did not have any interest and penalties associated with tax positions. As of September 30, 2020, we did not have any significant unrecognized uncertain tax positions.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and requires the Company to re-measure certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are anticipated to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The Company adopted the new rate as it relates to the calculations of deferred tax amounts as of January 1, 2018.\nNOTE 7 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nIssuance of Loans Payable\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Company received an aggregate of $275,000 related to the issuance of 14 notes payable to various noteholders, including an aggregate of $35,000 as a result of two notes payable issued to the Companys Chief Executive Officer, a related party.
