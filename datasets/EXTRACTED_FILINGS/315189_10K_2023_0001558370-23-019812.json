The model is based on the following three focus areas:\n1. Production Systems. A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers production systems. Production systems refer to the series of steps our customers take to execute different tasks, operations, and projects to grow an agricultural product or execute a project.\n2. Technology Stack. Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to our customers through hardware and devices, embedded software, connectivity, data platforms, and applications. The technology stack leverages the core technologies mentioned in the previous sentence across the enterprise, including digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies. The stack has the potential to unlock economic and sustainable value for customers by optimizing jobs, strengthening decision-making, and better connecting the steps of a production system.\n3. Lifecycle Solutions. The enterprise integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product, and with a specific lifecycle solution focus on the ownership experience. This integrated support seeks to enhance customer value through proactive and reactive support, easy access to parts, value-add services, and precision upgrades, regardless of when a customer purchases our equipment.\nBuilding upon the Smart Industrial Operating Model, we announced our Leap Ambitions framework in fiscal year 2022. The Leap Ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for our customers. The ambitions align across our customers production systems seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources.\nThe Leap Ambitions framework has three components: (i) size the incremental market opportunity, quantifying the value that can be created; (ii) identify the key actions required to guide investment in digitalization, autonomy, automation, and alternative power technologies; and (iii) define the desired financial and sustainable outcomes we hope to achieve to help investors and stakeholders understand the opportunities that can be unlocked in the future through present investments. Applying this framework, the Leap Ambitions set goals to measure the results under our Smart Industrial Operating Model. Current financial and sustainability goals for the Leap Ambitions relate to workforce safety, agriculture customer outcomes, product circularity, environmental footprint, Solutions as a Service, and equipment operations operating return on sales (OROS).\nWe aim to deliver ongoing value across our product lines by digitally connecting certain equipment we produce, enabling our customers to leverage technology for better economic and more sustainable outcomes in their businesses. We are introducing viable alternative power technologies for various product families. We also plan to enhance how we deliver value by introducing and scaling a Solutions as a Service business model.\nWe also aim to enable our agriculture customers to be more sustainable in their production steps by providing technology solutions that help to improve their nitrogen use efficiency, increase their crop protection efficiency, and reduce their CO2e emissions.\nWe believe we will deliver ongoing value to our SAT customers by increasing the connectivity of their equipment, offering electric options where feasible in our product families, and working toward production of a fully autonomous, battery powered electric agricultural tractor. For our CF customers, we aim to deliver ongoing value by offering electric and hybrid-electric options where feasible in our product families and increasing the use of grade management control for earthmoving customers, intelligent boom control for forestry customers, and precision roadbuilding solutions for our roadbuilding customers.\nWe anticipate enabling sustainable outcomes for our customers. Specifically, we aim to enable our agriculture customers to be more sustainable in their production steps by providing technology solutions that help to improve their nitrogen use efficiency, increase their crop protection efficiency, and reduce their CO2e emissions.\nAvailable Information\nOur internet address is http://www.deere.com. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports are available on our website free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed or furnished with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission). The information contained on our website is not included in, nor incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquipment Operations\nOur equipment operations consist of three of our business segments: PPA, SAT, and CF. In fiscal year 2023, PPA generated $26,790 net sales and revenue, or 48 percent of equipment operations net sales and revenues; SAT generated $13,980 net sales and revenues, or 25 percent of equipment operations net sales and revenues; and CF generated $14,795 net sales and revenues, or 27 percent of equipment operations net sales.\nProduction and Precision Agriculture\nAs compared with fiscal year 2022, PPA net sales for fiscal year 2023 were:\n(In millions of dollars)\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$26,790\n$22,002\n22%\nThe PPA segment is committed to meeting the fundamental needs of our customers through a combination of equipment and technology designed to enable our customers to overcome some of their biggest challenges: doing more with less, labor shortages, volatile input costs, and executing jobs in tighter timeframes. This segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions for production-scale growers of crops like large grains (such as corn and soy), small grains (such as wheat, oats, and barley), cotton, and sugarcane. Equipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, cotton strippers, sugarcane harvesters, related harvesting front-end equipment, and pull-behind scrapers. In addition, the segment includes tillage, seeding, and application equipment, including sprayers and nutrient management and soil preparation machinery.\nWe have been bringing innovations to agriculture for nearly 200 years and continue to invest in the development and production of advanced technology through integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across our portfolio of equipment. We have developed a differentiated, production system-level approach that helps us understand how customers operate, focusing on their costs, identifying the opportunities for them to reduce inputs, and increasing productivity, yield improvement, and sustainability. This approach directs our work. Advancements such as precise global navigation satellite systems technology, advanced connectivity and telematics, on-board sensors and computing power, automation software, digital tools, applications, and analytics provide seamless integration of information designed to improve customer decision-making and job execution. Our advanced telematics systems remotely connect equipment owners, business managers, and dealers to equipment in the field. This provides real-time alerts and information about equipment location, utilization, performance, and maintenance to improve productivity and efficiency, as well as to monitor agronomic job execution.\nWe aim to support our customers and their equipment throughout the entire equipment lifecycle. To prevent downtime, we offer a wide variety of aftermarket and customer solutions to keep equipment running, including machine monitoring, remote diagnostics, predictive maintenance alerts, and e-commerce solutions.\nExamples of recent developments to unlock customer value and address challenges in the field include ExactShot\u2122 and FurrowVision, which help customers reduce inputs during planting applications, generating cost savings, and lowering their environmental footprint; our fully autonomous 8R tillage tractor with a GPS guidance system and stereo cameras to execute tillage work without an in-cab operator, which helps to address farmers labor challenges and time constraints; and See & Spray\u2122 Ultimate, which targets the application of non-residual herbicides on weeds in corn, soybean, and cotton fields.\nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of PPA products and their associated brand names:\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nSprayers\nHagie, Mazzotti\nPlanters and Cultivators\nMonosem\nSprayers and Planters\nPLA\nCarbon Fiber Sprayer Booms\nKing Agro\nSugarcane Harvester Aftermarket Parts\nUnimil\nAftermarket Parts for PPA Products\nVapormatic, A&I, Unimil, Alternatives by John Deere\nSmall Agriculture and Turf\nAs compared with fiscal year 2022, SAT net sales for fiscal year 2023 were:\n(In millions of dollars)\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$13,980\n$13,381\n4%\nSAT is committed to meeting the needs of our customers through defining, developing, and delivering global equipment and technology solutions designed to unlock customer value and sustainability for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segment works to provide product leadership while extending integrated agricultural solutions and precision technologies across its portfolio of equipment to unlock incremental value for customers. Similar to PPA, the SAT segment aims to support customers and their equipment through the entire equipment lifecycle.\nEquipment manufactured and distributed by the segment includes certain mid-size, small and utility tractors, and related loaders and attachments; turf and utility equipment, including riding lawn equipment, commercial mowing equipment, golf course equipment, utility vehicles, implements for mowing, tilling, snow and debris handling, aerating, and other residential, commercial, golf, and sports turf care applications; and hay and forage equipment, including self-propelled forage harvesters and attachments, balers, and mowers. SAT equipment is sold primarily through independent retail dealer networks, although the segment also builds turf products for sale by mass retailers, including The Home Depot and Lowes. Our turf equipment is sold primarily in North American, Western European, and Australian markets.\nIn the small agriculture market, we have introduced autonomous solutions, connectivity capabilities, and a path to electrifying our future by delivering a portfolio that helps current customers meet sustainability goals while finding innovative ways to serve new customers and unlock new markets for mechanization, at scale. For example, our joint venture with GUSS Automation, LLC in fiscal year 2022 added to our portfolio an autonomous sprayer to target our high value crop customers needs. In fiscal year 2023, we announced the acquisition of Smart Apply, Inc., a precision spraying equipment company. The Smart Apply Intelligent Spray Control System\u2122 stacked with GUSS Automations remote sprayer is aimed at the needs of our high-value crop customers to improve their productivity and optimize inputs. On the turf side of the business, in fiscal year 2023 we launched two battery-powered walk behind mowers and announced certain hybrid innovations.\nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of SAT products and their associated brand names:\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nEquipment Attachments\nFrontier, Kemper, GreenSystem, Smart Apply\nAftermarket Parts for SAT\nVapormatic, A&I, Sunbelt, Alternatives by John Deere\nAgriculture and Turf Operations\nSmart Industrial Operating Model. Our PPA and SAT segments offer a full line of agriculture and turf equipment and related service parts. As part of our Smart Industrial Operating Model, the segments are aligned around production systems, enabling focus on delivering equipment, technology, and solutions across all the jobs customers execute during a season. Sales and marketing support for both the PPA and SAT segments continues to be organized around four geographic regions: U.S., Canada, and Australia; Latin America and South America; Europe, Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); and Africa and Asia.\nBusiness Environment. Sales of agricultural equipment are affected by total farm cash receipts, which reflect levels of farm commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies, including global trade policies, the amount and timing of government payments, and policies related to climate change. Sales also are influenced by general economic conditions, farmland prices, farmers debt levels and access to financing, interest and exchange rates, agricultural trends, including the production of and demand for renewable fuels, labor availability and costs, energy costs, tax policies, and other input costs associated with farming. Other key factors affecting new agricultural equipment sales are the value, age, and level of used equipment, including tractors, harvesting equipment, self-propelled sprayers, hay and forage equipment, and seeding equipment. Weather and climatic conditions also can affect buying decisions of agricultural equipment purchasers.\nInnovations in machinery and technology also influence agricultural equipment purchasing. For example, larger, more productive equipment is well accepted where farmers are striving for more efficiency in their operations. Large, cost-efficient, highly mechanized agricultural operations account for an important share of worldwide farm output. These customers are increasingly adopting and integrating precision agricultural technologies like guidance, telematics, automation, and data management in their operations. The large-size agricultural equipment used on such farms has been particularly important to us. A large proportion of the equipment\noperations total agricultural equipment sales in the U.S. and Canada, as well as in many countries outside the U.S. and Canada, are comprised of tractors over 100 horsepower, self-propelled combines, self-propelled cotton pickers, self-propelled forage harvesters, self-propelled sprayers, and seeding equipment. However, small tractors are also an important part of our global business. Further, we offer a number of harvesting solutions to support development of the mechanized harvesting of grain, oilseeds, cotton, sugarcane, forage, and biomass.\nRetail sales of lawn and garden tractors, compact utility tractors, residential and commercial mowers, utility vehicles, and golf and turf equipment are influenced by the housing market, weather conditions, consumer spending patterns, and general economic conditions like unemployment, interest, and inflation rates.\nSeasonality. Seasonal patterns in retail demand for agricultural equipment can result in substantial variations in the volume and mix of products sold to retail customers during the year. Seasonal demand must be estimated in advance, and equipment must be manufactured in anticipation of such demand to achieve efficient utilization of personnel and facilities throughout the year. The PPA and SAT segments can incur substantial seasonal variations in cash flows to finance production and inventory of agricultural and turf equipment. The segments also incur costs to finance sales to dealers in advance of seasonal demand.\nFor certain equipment, we offer early order programs, which can include discounts to retail customers that place orders well in advance of the use season. Production schedules are based, in part, on these early order programs; however, during periods of high demand, some factories may still produce after the use season. New combine and cotton harvesting equipment has been sold under early order programs with waivers of retail finance charges available to customers who take delivery of machines during non-use seasons.\nIn Australia, Canada, and the U.S., there are typically several used equipment trade-in transactions that take place in connection with most new agricultural equipment sales. To provide support to our dealers in these countries for carrying and ultimately selling this used inventory to retail customers, we provide these dealers with pools of funds awarded as a percentage of the dealer cost for eligible new equipment sales at the time of the new equipment settlement.\nRetail demand for turf and utility equipment is normally higher in the second and third fiscal quarters. We have pursued a strategy of building and shipping such equipment as close to retail demand as possible. Consequently, to increase asset turnover and reduce the average level of field inventories throughout the year, production and shipment schedules of these product lines are normally proportionately higher in the second and third fiscal quarters of each year, corresponding closely to the seasonal pattern of retail sales. However, the patterns of seasonality have been affected by the supply chain disruptions experienced during fiscal year 2022.\nConstruction and Forestry\nAs compared with fiscal year 2022, CF net sales for fiscal year 2023 were:\n(In millions of dollars)\n% Change\nNet Sales\n$14,795\n$12,534\n18%\nOur CF segment is committed to meeting the need for smart and more sustainable solutions to help our customers meet industry challenges, including jobsite safety, a shortage of skilled labor, volatile input costs, reducing rework, maximizing uptime, and minimizing their environmental footprint. CF also aims to support customers and their equipment through the entire equipment lifecycle (see PPA section above).\nTo address these challenges and unlock value for customers, we deliver a robust portfolio of construction, roadbuilding, and forestry products with precision technology solutions. Our smart solutions such as SmartWeigh\u2122, grade control offerings, machine and system automation, and operations center, are designed to allow customers to complete more functions with fewer inputs, reduce rework and guesswork, and transform data into insights to allow for better decisions. Obstacle detection solutions such as SmartDetect\u2122 supplements operator visibility on the jobsite through a combination of cameras, radar, and machine learning. Additionally, we plan to deliver hybrid-electric and battery electric equipment solutions to help customers reduce tailpipe emissions without sacrificing power and performance. We currently have the 644X four-wheel-drive loader and 944X four-wheel-drive loader in production with an electric drive coupled with a diesel engine.\nOur primary construction products include excavators, wheel loaders, motor graders, dozers, backhoes, articulated dump trucks, compact construction equipment including skid steers, compact excavators, and compact track loaders, along with a variety of attachments. Our Wirtgen roadbuilding products include milling machines, pavers, compactors, rollers, crushers, screens, and asphalt plants. Similar to the construction product lineup, the Wirtgen brand also provides a technology stack aimed at allowing customers to make smarter and more sustainable decisions. Technology offerings include Wirtgen Performance Tracker, Mill Assist, Level Pro, V\u00f6gele Roadscan, Smart Compact, WITOS Paving, Spective Connect, AutoTrac\u2122, and John Deere Connected Support\u2122.\nIn forestry, our primary products include skidders, wheeled and tracked feller bunchers, forwarders, knuckleboom loaders, wheeled and tracked harvesters, swing machines, and precision forestry technology solutions such as Intelligent Boom Control, TimberMatic\u2122 maps, and TimberManager\u2122. These solutions allow customers to closely track jobsite progress and provide visibility into fleet location, utilization, performance, and maintenance information.\nWe have a number of initiatives in the rent-to-rent, or short-term rental, market for construction, earthmoving, roadbuilding, and material handling equipment. These include specially designed rental programs for our dealers and expanded cooperation with major national equipment rental companies.\nWe own retail forestry sales operations in Australia, Brazil, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Wirtgen Group sells its products primarily through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in many markets worldwide (most significantly in Europe, India, and Australia). In most other geographies, we sell through an independent dealer channel.\nThe prevailing levels of residential, commercial, and public construction, investment in infrastructure, and the condition of the forestry products industry influence retail sales of our construction, roadbuilding, and forestry equipment. General economic conditions, interest rate levels, the availability of credit, and certain commodity prices, such as those applicable to oil and gas, pulp, paper, and saw logs, also influence sales.\nIn addition to John Deere brand names, the table below provides a list of CF products and their associated brand names:\nPRODUCT\nBRAND NAME\nRoadbuilding Equipment\nWirtgen, V\u00f6gele, Hamm, Kleemann, Benninghoven, and Ciber\nForestry Attachments\nWaratah\nCompetition\nThe equipment operations sell products and services in a variety of competitive global and regional markets. The principal competitive factors in all markets include product performance, innovation, quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and value. John Deeres brand recognition is a competitive factor in North America and many other parts of the world.\nThe agricultural equipment industry continues to change and is becoming even more competitive through the emergence and expanding global capability of many competitors. The competitive environment for the agriculture and turf operations includes some global competitors, including AGCO Corporation, CLAAS KGaA mbH, CNH Industrial N.V., Kubota Tractor Corporation, Mahindra & Mahindra Limited, and The Toro Company, as well as many regional and local competitors. These competitors have varying numbers of product lines competing with our products and each has varying degrees of regional focus. Additional competition within the agricultural equipment industry has come from a variety of short-line and specialty manufacturers, as well as local or regional competitors, with differing manufacturing and marketing methods. As technology increasingly enables enhanced productivity in agriculture, the industry is also attracting non-traditional competitors, including technology-focused companies and start-up ventures.\nOur forestry and roadbuilding businesses operate globally. The construction business operates in competitive markets in North and South America, as well as other global markets. Global competitors of the CF segment include Caterpillar Inc., CNH Industrial N.V., Doosan Infracore Co., Ltd. and its subsidiary Doosan Bobcat Inc., Fayat Group, GOMACO Corporation, Hitachi Construction Machinery, Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Tractor Corporation, Ponsse Plc, SANY Group Co., Ltd., Terex, Tigercat Industries Inc., Volvo Construction Equipment (part of Volvo Group AB), and XCMG.\nManufacturing and Assembly\nCommon manufacturing processes and techniques are used in producing components for PPA, SAT, and CF equipment sold by us and our dealers. The equipment operations also pursue external sales of selected parts that can be manufactured and supplied to third parties on a competitive basis, including engines, power train components, and electronic components. The equipment operations manufacturing strategy involves four elements: Build a Stronger Business, Deliver Innovation, Excite the Customer, and Live the Team.\u202f\nBuild a Stronger Business refers to our ability to execute lean initiatives supported by safety, quality, delivery, and productivity goals.\nDeliver Innovation refers to implementing our digitally connected factory projects to improve efficiency and differentiated value.\u202fWe implement technology solutions to support our factories across the globe to increase our speed of manufacturing innovation and allow the workforce to focus on high-value tasks.\nExcite the Customer refers to designing operations to be flexible and accommodate product design changes to meet market conditions and changing customer requirements.\nLive the Team refers to building a safety culture by ensuring that employees are safe at work.\nTo utilize manufacturing facilities and technology more effectively, the equipment operations pursue continuous improvements in manufacturing processes, including steps to streamline manufacturing processes and enhance responsiveness to customers.

We further our competitive position by filing patent and trademark applications in the U.S. and internationally to protect technology, improvements considered important to the business, and our brand. We believe that, taken together, our rights under these patents and licenses are important to our operations and competitive position, but do not regard any of our businesses as being dependent upon any single patent or family of patents. See Risk Factors- Our business could be adversely affected by the infringement or loss of intellectual property rights for more information.\nSales and Distribution\nThrough the U.S. and Canada, we market products to approximately 2,050 independent dealer locations. Of these, approximately 1,600 sell agricultural equipment, while approximately 450 sell construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, and/or forestry equipment. In addition, roadbuilding equipment is sold at approximately 90 roadbuilding-only locations that may carry products that compete with our construction, earthmoving, material handling, and/or forestry equipment. Turf equipment is sold at most John Deere agricultural equipment locations, a few construction, earthmoving, material handling, roadbuilding, and/or forestry equipment locations, and about 280 turf-only locations, many of which also sell dissimilar lines of non-John Deere products. In addition, certain lawn and garden product lines are sold through The Home Depot and Lowes.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada, our agriculture and turf equipment is sold to distributors and dealers for resale in over 100 countries. Sales and administrative offices are in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Mexico, Poland, Singapore, Sweden, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. Turf equipment sales outside the U.S. and Canada occur primarily in Western Europe and Australia. Construction, earthmoving, material handling, and forestry equipment is sold to distributors and dealers primarily by sales offices located in Australia, Brazil, Finland, New Zealand, Singapore, and the United Kingdom. Some of these dealers are independently owned while we own others. Roadbuilding equipment is sold directly to retail customers and independent distributors and dealers for resale. As of November 1, 2022, we did not renew dealer agreements in Russia, and in October 2023, we sold our roadbuilding business in Russia. Consequently, we no longer sell equipment in Russia. The Wirtgen Group operates company-owned sales and service subsidiaries in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, China, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, South Africa, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, and the United Kingdom. The equipment operations operate centralized parts distribution warehouses in the U.S., Brazil, and Germany in coordination with regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.\nWe market engines, power trains, and electronic components worldwide through select sales branches or directly to regional and global original equipment manufacturers and independently owned engine distributors.\nRaw Materials\nWe purchase raw materials, manufactured components, and replacement parts for our equipment, engines, and other products from leading suppliers both domestically and internationally. These materials and components include a variety of steel products, metal castings, forgings, plastics, hydraulics, electronics, and ready-to-assemble components made to certain specifications. We also purchase various goods and services used for production, logistics, offices, and research and development. We develop and maintain sourcing strategies for our purchased materials and emphasize long-term supplier relationships at the core of these strategies. We use a variety of agreements with suppliers intended to drive innovation, ensure availability and delivery of industry-leading quality raw materials and components, manage costs on a globally competitive basis, protect our intellectual property, and minimize other supply-related risks. We actively monitor supply chain risks to minimize the likelihood of business disruptions caused by the supply base,\nincluding supplier financial viability, capacity, business continuity, labor availability, quality, delivery, cybersecurity, weather-related events, and natural disasters. We have implemented mitigation efforts to minimize the impact of potential and actual supply chain disruptions on our customers. Examples include working with the supply base to prioritize allocations to improve material availability, multi-sourcing selected parts and materials, entering long term contracts for some critical components, and using alternative freight carriers to expedite delivery.\nBacklog Orders\nThe dollar amount of backlog orders as of October 29, 2023 was approximately $7.9 billion for the PPA segment and $3.3 billion for the SAT segment, compared with $9.7 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, at October 30, 2022. The agriculture and turf backlog are generally highest in the second and third quarters due to seasonal buying trends in these industries. The dollar amount of backlog orders for the CF segment was approximately $6.4 billion at October 29, 2023, compared with $8.2 billion at October 30, 2022, including, for both periods, backlog orders for roadbuilding equipment, which had not historically been included in discussions of the CF segments backlog orders. Backlog orders for equipment operations include all orders deemed to be firm as of the referenced date. Backlog orders decreased as demand has declined.\nFinancial Services\nU.S. and Canada. The financial services segment primarily provides and administers financing for retail purchases from our dealers of new equipment manufactured by our agricultural and turf and construction and forestry markets, as well as used equipment taken in trade for this equipment. The Company and John Deere Construction & Forestry Company (a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company) are referred to as the sales companies. John Deere Capital Corporation (Capital Corporation), a U.S. financial services subsidiary, generally purchases retail installment sales and loan contracts (retail notes) from the sales companies. In Canada, John Deere Financial Inc., a Canadian financial services subsidiary, purchases and finances retail notes acquired by John Deere Canada ULC, our Canadian sales company. The terms of retail notes and the basis on which the financial services operations acquire retail notes from the sales companies are governed by agreements with the sales companies. The financial services segment also finances and services revolving charge accounts, in most cases acquired from and offered through merchants in the agricultural and turf markets. Additionally, the financial services operations provide wholesale financing to dealers of our agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment (wholesale notes), primarily to finance inventories of equipment for those dealers. The various financing options offered by the financial services operations are designed to enhance sales of our products and generate financing income for the financial services operations. In the U.S. and Canada, certain subsidiaries included in the financial services segment offer extended equipment warranties.\nRetail notes acquired by the sales companies are immediately sold to the financial services operations. The equipment operations are the financial services operations major source of business, although many retail purchasers of our products finance their purchases outside our organization through a variety of sources, including commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.\nThe financial services operations offer retail leases to equipment users in the U.S. A small number of leases are executed with units of local governments. Leases are usually written for periods ranging from less than one year to seven years, and typically contain an option permitting the customer to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term. Retail leases also are offered in a generally similar manner to customers in Canada.\nThe financial services operations terms for financing equipment retail sales (other than smaller items financed with unsecured revolving charge accounts) generally provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain John Deere products sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in other sales promotions. The financial services operations generally receive compensation from the sales companies at approximate market interest rates for periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases. The cost is accounted for as a deduction in arriving at net sales by the equipment operations.\nWe have an agreement with Capital Corporation to make payments to Capital Corporation such that its consolidated ratio of earnings to fixed charges is not less than 1.05 to 1 for any four consecutive fiscal quarterly periods. We also have committed to continuing to own, directly or through one or more wholly-owned subsidiaries, at least 51 percent of the voting shares of capital stock of Capital Corporation and to maintain Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth at not less than $50 million. Our obligations to make payments to Capital Corporation under this agreement are independent of whether Capital Corporation is in default on its indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Further, our obligations under the agreement are not measured by the amount of Capital Corporations indebtedness, obligations, or other liabilities. Our obligations to make payments under this agreement are expressly stated not to be a guaranty of any specific indebtedness, obligation, or liability of Capital Corporation and are enforceable only by or in the name of Capital Corporation. As of October 29, 2023, we were in compliance with all of our obligations, and no payments were required under this agreement in fiscal year 2023 or fiscal year 2022. At October 29, 2023, we indirectly owned\n100 percent of the voting shares of Capital Corporations capital stock and Capital Corporations consolidated tangible net worth was $5,901.6 million.\nOutside the U.S. and Canada. The financial services operations also offer financing, primarily for our products, in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, New Zealand, and in several other countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. John Deere Financial sold its financial services business in Russia during the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. In certain markets, financing is offered through cooperation agreements or joint ventures with other financial institutions. The way the financial services operations offer financing in these countries is affected by a variety of country-specific laws, regulations, and customs, including those governing property rights and debtor obligations, which are subject to change, and which may introduce greater risk to the financial services operations.\nThe financial services operations also offer to select customers and dealers credit enhanced international export financing primarily for the purchase of our products.\nAdditional information on the financial services operations is provided in the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) section in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to a variety of local, state, and federal environmental laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as the environmental laws and regulations of other countries in which we conduct business. We strive to comply with applicable laws and regulations; however, in the event of noncompliance, we could be subject to fines and other penalties. Compliance with these laws and regulations adds to the cost of our production operations. Compliance with emissions regulations adds to the cost of our products. However, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities during fiscal year 2024. In addition to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint through our Leap Ambitions framework and seek opportunities to reduce environmental impacts on the communities where we operate.\nThe U.S., the European Union (EU), India, and other governments throughout the world have enacted, and continue to enact, laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. Compliance with these regulations requires significant investments in the development of new engine technologies and after-treatment systems.\nGovernments also are implementing laws regulating products across their life cycles, including raw material sourcing and the storage, distribution, sale, use, and disposal of products at their end-of-life. These laws and regulations include requirements to develop less hazardous chemical substances and products, right-to-know, restriction of hazardous substances, and product take-back laws.\nWe are evaluating, cleaning-up, or conducting corrective action at a limited number of sites. We do not expect that these matters or other expenses or liabilities we may incur in connection with any noncompliance with environmental laws, regulations, or the clean-up of any additional properties, will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or competitive position.\nWe continue to monitor and review developing sustainability frameworks, standards, and global regulations and work to incorporate those most applicable to our business into our sustainability reporting.\nWith respect to properties and businesses that have been or will be acquired, we conduct due diligence into potential exposure to environmental liabilities but cannot be certain that we have identified, or will identify, all adverse environmental conditions. Compliance with these laws and regulations adds to the cost of our production operations. Compliance with emissions regulations adds to the cost of our products. However, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls facilities during fiscal year 2024. In addition to ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, we aim to reduce our environmental footprint through our Leap Ambitions framework and seek opportunities to reduce environmental impacts on the communities where we operate.\nNew regulations applicable to John Deere products\nCalifornia promulgated regulations prohibiting the use of small off-road spark-ignition engines under 25 horsepower. These regulations go into effect in 2024 and will impact some of our products, such as our turf care and golf course maintenance products. Even though we do not expect a material impact to our business from these regulations, to comply with new laws and regulations that limit off-road gasoline and diesel-powered engines, we intend to offer an electric option in each turf and compact utility tractor product family by 2026. However, compliance with emissions regulations has added, and will continue to add, to the cost of our products.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to a wide variety of local, state, and federal laws and regulations in the countries where we operate. These laws and regulations include a range of trade, product, foreign exchange, employment, tax, environmental, safety, data privacy, antitrust, and other laws and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of our employees, as well as financial resources. In fiscal year 2023, compliance with the regulations applicable to us did not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. At this time, we do not expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with regulations during fiscal year 2024. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in Item 1A, Risk Factors - Strategic Risks and Legal and Compliance Risks.\nHuman Capital\nHigher Purpose\nOur employees are guided by our higher purpose: We run so life can leap forward. Employees are further guided by our Code of Business Conduct (Code), which helps them to uphold and strengthen the standards of honor and integrity that have defined us since our founding. Our world and business may change, yet we continue to be guided by our core values- integrity, quality, commitment, and innovation.\nEmployees\nAt October 29, 2023, we had approximately 83,000 employees, including approximately 33,800 employees in the U.S. and Canada. We also retain consultants, independent contractors, temporary, and part-time workers. Unions are certified as bargaining agents for approximately 80 percent of our U.S. production and maintenance employees. Approximately 11,500 of our active U.S. production and maintenance workers are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), with an expiration date of November 1, 2027. A small number of U.S. production employees are represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM). Collective bargaining agreements covering our employees in the U.S. expire between 2024 and 2027. Unions also represent the majority of employees at our manufacturing facilities outside the U.S.\nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to renew collective bargaining agreements or whether such agreements will be on terms satisfactory to us. For further discussion, see Risk Factors-Disputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our facilities as well as impact our financial results.\nCode of Business Conduct\nWe are committed to conducting business in accordance with the highest ethical standards. We require all employees to complete training on our Code and, where permitted by law, also require that employees regularly certify compliance with the Code. The Code provides specific guidance to all our employees, outlining how they can and must uphold and strengthen the integrity that has defined John Deere since its founding. In addition, we maintain a global compliance hotline to allow for concerns of potential violations of the Code, global policies, or the law to be brought forward.\nHealth and Safety\nWe strive to achieve safety excellence through increased focus on leading indicators, risk reduction, health and safety management systems, and prevention. We have made progress on implementing best practices and leading indicators for enabling employee safety over recent years with our Health and Safety Management System.\nWe utilize a safety balanced scorecard, which includes leading and lagging indicators, and is designed to enable continuous measurement of safety performance and drive continuous improvement. Leading indicators include incident corrective action closure rates, ergonomic scorecard, and risk reduction from safety and ergonomic risk assessment projects. Lagging indicators include total recordable incident rate, ergonomic recordable case rate, and near-miss rate. Leading indicators are tracked by most of our manufacturing facilities and internally reported. In fiscal year 2023, we reported a total recordable incident rate of 2.08 and a lost time frequency rate of 0.65. To improve our total recordable incident rate, we will prioritize risk and injury reduction strategies, improve ergonomic programs, and focus on prevention through design.\nWe also updated our new employee onboarding in fiscal year 2023 to include training labs, hands-on-training, tooling and process exposures on the shop floor, operator checklists, and training videos of workstations.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nWe adhere to the principle of equal employment opportunity and we believe that a diverse workforce is essential to our long-term success and solving our customers most pressing challenges. We strive to foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. We\nembrace employees differences in race, color, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity and expression, marital or partnership status, family status, citizenship, national origin, ancestry, geographic background, military or veteran status, disability (mental or physical), and any other characteristics that make our employees unique.\nOur leadership team works to set a consistent and transparent tone on DEI issues and strategy. We also create spaces for open conversations and learning through our Employee Resources Groups (ERGs) speaker series and micro-learnings. We sponsor 13 ERGs that are run by employees, open to all employees, and are a key driver of inclusion. ERGs build organization-wide networks that allow employees to come together and discuss shared interests. The global chapters work with local teams to support efforts to attract, retain, and develop the best talent. In addition, our global DEI strategy focuses on embedding DEI into world-wide business operations and people processes.\nIn addition to recruiting from a wide array of colleges and universities, we partner with several professional organizations to support our diversity recruitment strategy, including AnitaB.org - a global organization for women in technology, Minorities in Agriculture Natural Resources and Related Sciences, the National Association of Black Accountants, Inc., the National Black MBA Association, Inc., the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, the Thurgood Marshall College Fund Leadership Institute, and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers. Our broad recruiting strategy helps us identify talent from all backgrounds.\nCompensation & Benefits\nOur total rewards are intended to be competitive, meet the varied needs of our global workforce, and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing comprehensive and competitive pay and benefits to our employees. We invested, and continue to invest, in employees through growth and development and well-being initiatives.\nOur work environment is designed to promote innovation, well-being, and reward performance. Our total rewards for employees include a variety of components that aim to support sustainable employment and the ability to build a strong financial future, including competitive market-based pay and comprehensive benefits. In addition to earning base pay, eligible employees are compensated for their contributions to our goals with both short-term cash incentives and long-term equity-based incentives.\nEligible full-time employees in the U.S. have access to medical, dental, and vision plans; savings and retirement plans; parental leave and paid time off; and other resources, such as the Employee Assistance Program, which provides mental health and wellness services. We also offer a variety of working arrangements to eligible employees, including flexible schedules, remote work, and job sharing to help employees manage home and work-life situations. Programs and benefits differ internationally for a variety of reasons, such as local legal requirements, market practices, and negotiations with works councils, trade unions, and other employee representative bodies.\nTraining and Development\nEmployees are critical to the long-term success of our business. We encourage employees to identify the paths that can build the skills, experience, knowledge, and competencies needed for career advancement. We support employees by creating purpose-driven work opportunities, comprehensive performance reviews and development plans, mentoring opportunities, and professional and personal development opportunities.\nWe encourage employees to provide feedback across the enterprise through our internal voluntary employee experience survey, ad-hoc pulse surveys, and new-hire and exit surveys. Reports from these surveys help equip us to address needs across the employee lifecycle to improve the overall experience and engagement of our workforce.\nAround the world, we offer internships, training, upskilling, apprenticeships, and leadership development at all stages of an employees career. Training programs are tailored to different geographic regions and job functions and include topics such as technical operation of equipment, equipment assembly, relationships with customers and dealers, our culture and values, compliance with the Code, compliance with anti-bribery/corruption laws and policies, compliance with management of private data and cybersecurity, conflicts of interest, discrimination and workplace harassment policies, sexual harassment policies, and leadership development.\nHuman Rights and Our Code of Conduct\nWe honor human rights and respect the individual dignity of all persons globally. Our commitment to human rights requires that we understand and fulfill our responsibilities consistent with our values and practices. We strive to ensure that human rights are upheld for our employees and workers in our supply chain. Our commitment to human rights is defined in the Code, our Supplier Code of Conduct, our Dealer Code of Conduct, related policies and procedures, and our statement Support of Human Rights in our Business Practice, each of which is available on our website under Governance. These documents establish guidelines for our employees, suppliers, and dealers. We do not tolerate human rights abuses, such as forced labor, unlawful child labor, and human trafficking.\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nThe following are our executive officers as of December 6, 2023.

This discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with the MD&A, including the risks and uncertainties described in the Forward-Looking Statements, and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These risk factors and other forward-looking statements relate to future events, expectations, trends, and operating periods. They involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect particular lines of business, while others could affect all our businesses. Although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Forward-Looking Statements in this report are not the only risks faced by us.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nWe may face risks associated with international, national, and regional trade laws, regulations, and policies, and government farm programs and policies which could significantly impair our profitability and growth prospects.\nInternational, national, and regional laws, regulations, and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of our products, services, and technology, or those of our customers, or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors, could harm our global business. We are subject to various regulatory risks including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf Restricted access to global markets could impair our ability to export goods and services from various manufacturing locations around the world. Restricted access could limit the ability to access raw materials and high-quality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis. For example, expanding export controls or limits on foreign investment can impact global supply of key materials and components, and actions taken within the US-China trade conflict can impact business in China, as well as sales, import/exports, and/or business engagement with Chinese entities globally.\n\u25cf Trade restrictions, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, export control and sanctions against Russia, have limited, and could continue to limit, our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets. These trade restrictions, and changes in, or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies, may affect our competitive position.\n\u25cf Trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living, which could negatively impact our future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food, fuel, and infrastructure.\n\u25cf Policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices, or those limiting the export or import of commodities, could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world. Our agricultural equipment sales could be harmed by such policies because farm income influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world.\n\u25cf Changes in government farm programs and policies can influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies.\nWe may be unable to manage increasing political, economic, and social uncertainty in certain regions of the world, which could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base, and product offerings globally.\nEfforts to grow our businesses depend in part upon access and developing market share and profitability in additional geographic markets, including, but not limited to, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, and South Africa. There are various risks associated with our global footprint, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions, and differing customer product preferences and requirements than our other markets. In fiscal year 2023, as a result of the war in Ukraine, we suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia. The suspension of shipments to Russia reduced actual and forecasted revenue for the region and resulted in impairments of most long-lived assets, among other impacts. In addition, we initiated a voluntary separation program for employees in Russia in the third quarter of fiscal year 2022.\n\u25cf Having business operations in various regions and countries exposes us to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change. These practices and legal requirements are often complex and difficult to navigate, including those related to tariffs and trade regulations, investments, property ownership rights, taxation, repatriation of earnings, and advanced technologies.\n\u25cf Expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations, which can materially affect our financial results.\n\u25cf While we maintain a positive corporate image and our brands are widely recognized and valued in our traditional markets, the brands are less known in some emerging markets, which could impede our efforts to successfully compete in these markets.\n\u25cf Changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on various foreign countries and on various parties could affect our ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket warranty support for our equipment, sell products, and otherwise impact our reputation and business.\nWe may be impacted by general negative economic conditions and outlook, causing weakened demand for our equipment and services, limiting access to funding, and resulting in higher funding costs.\nThe demand for our products and services depends on the fundamentals in the markets in which we operate and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment, high interest rates, cautious consumer spending, inflation, lower corporate earnings, and lower business investment. Negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause our customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing our equipment. These economic events adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our operations.\nSustained general negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts, energy prices and demand, and other construction, which dampens demand for certain construction equipment. Our turf operations and our construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions. Decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nIf negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy, there could be a similar effect on our agricultural equipment sales. Uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive U.S. fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook, such as market volatility and continuing interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions. Such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs, which could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nWe may be affected by changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of renewable energy, which could impact the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for our equipment. This could result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements.\nChanging worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and renewable energy demands, driven in part by government policies, including those related to climate change, and a growing world population, are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices, which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment. Lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes, which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses. While higher commodity prices benefit our crop-producing agricultural equipment customers, they could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers, which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers. In addition, changing energy renewable demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise, with corresponding changes in equipment demands. Finally, changes in governmental policies regulating bio-fuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices, demand for our diesel-fueled equipment, and result in higher research and development costs related to equipment fuel standards.\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions.\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and related business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could adversely affect results of our operations and financial condition. Several factors could impact our ability to successfully execute our Smart Industrial Operating Model, including, among other things:\n\u25cf Failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities;\n\u25cf Failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by our customers;\n\u25cf Failure to holistically provide lifecycle solutions; and\n\u25cf Failure to optimize our capital allocation in connection with the Smart Industrial Operating Model.\nSimilarly, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our Leap Ambitions and related goals within the expected timelines, or at all. As part of our Leap Ambitions we adopted various goals we expect to achieve by 2026 or 2030. We may not be able to achieve these goals for a variety reasons, some of which may be beyond our control. Examples include:\n\u25cf Our estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of our products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate;\n\u25cf Certain materials, such as quality battery cells and cameras, may become unavailable or too costly;\n\u25cf The infrastructure required to achieve our goals, such as sufficient charging stations or fuel availability, may become too costly or may not be developed on the expected timeline; and\n\u25cf The actual or perceived failure to achieve our Leap Ambitions could negatively impact our ability to execute the Smart Industrial Operating Model.\nWe may not realize all anticipated benefits of acquisitions, joint ventures, and divestitures, or these benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nFrom time to time, we make strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participate in joint ventures. Acquisitions and joint ventures we have entered, or may enter in the future, may involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment. Other risks include:\n\u25cf We may encounter difficulties in integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, assimilating new capabilities to meet the future needs of our businesses, and/or combining business cultures;\n\u25cf We may choose not to fully integrate businesses and may face regulatory or compliance exposure until appropriate processes and controls are put in place;\n\u25cf Integrating acquisitions is often costly and may require significant attention from management and personnel;\n\u25cf We may not realize all the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or joint ventures, or the realized benefits may be significantly delayed; and\n\u25cf Due diligence evaluations of potential transactions include business, legal, and financial reviews with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved. These due diligence reviews may not identify all of the issues necessary to accurately estimate the cost and potential risks of a particular acquisition or joint venture, including potential exposure to regulatory sanctions resulting from an acquisition targets or joint venture partners previous activities or costs associated with any quality issues with an acquisition targets or joint ventures products or services.\nWe may also decide to divest businesses if in the best interests of our shareholders and joint ventures may be terminated at or before their stated expiration. For example, in March and October 2023, we sold our financial services and roadbuilding businesses in Russia following the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs or disruptions to us, and negative effects on our product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Divestitures of businesses and dissolutions of joint ventures may result in ongoing financial or legal involvement in the divested business through indemnifications or other financial arrangements, such as retained liabilities, which could affect our future financial results.\nOur ability to understand our customers preferences and requirements and to develop, manufacture, and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect our business results.\nOur ability to match new product offerings to global customers preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality, at affordable prices, is critical to our success. This requires a thorough understanding of our existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina, Brazil, and India. Failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, customer preferences in the markets we serve are changing as a result of ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability as these markets transition to less carbon-intensive business models. As regulations and social pressure drive change, we must continue to proactively monitor trends and develop alternatives and enhancements that elevate and complement our product offerings. For example, even though we plan to offer electric, hybrid-electric, and battery electric equipment solutions, we may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture, turf, and construction equipment.\nThe development of alternative farming techniques, carbon sequestration technologies, and new low-carbon biofuels are changing farmers business models and equipment needs. If we fail to continue to develop or invest in emerging technologies to meet changing customer demands, we will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue, which could affect our future financial results.\nIf we are unable to deliver precision technology and agricultural solutions to our customers, it could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur approach to precision technology involves hardware and software, guidance, connectivity and digital solutions, automation and machine intelligence, and autonomy. Customers continue to adopt technology integrated in our portfolio of smart machines, systems, and solutions. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. To create and maintain a competitive differentiation, we need to successfully develop and introduce new precision technology solutions that improve profitability and sustainability for our customers. We may make significant investments in research and development, connectivity solutions, digital security for precision technology solutions, and dealer and employee training. These investments may not produce solutions that provide the desired results for customers profitability or sustainability outcomes. We utilize automation and machine learning and intelligence in some of our products. While the use of these emerging technologies can present significant benefits, it also creates risks and challenges. Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, program bias into decision-making algorithms, security problems, and the protection of privacy could impair the adoption and acceptance of autonomous machine solutions. If the output from these solutions is deemed to be inaccurate or questionable, our brand and reputation may be harmed and we may be subject to legal liability claims. Automation and machine learning and intelligence may also become the subject of local, state, federal, and foreign regulatory efforts limiting the features and capabilities of the technology. If we are not able to deliver precision technology solutions with differentiated features and functionality, or these solutions are not effective, customers may not adopt technology solutions, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nWe could be impacted by changes to or reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands which could disrupt or degrade the reliability of our high precision augmented Global Positioning System (GPS) or other RF technology, which could impair our ability to develop and market GPS- and RF-based technology solutions, as well as significantly reduce agricultural and construction customers profitability.\nOur current and planned integrated agricultural business and equipment management systems, as well as our fleet management telematics solutions for construction equipment, depend upon the use of RF signals. These signals include, but are not limited to, GPS signals, other GPS-like satellite signals, augmented GPS services, and other RF technologies that link equipment, operations, owners, dealers, and technicians. These radio services depend on frequency allocations governed by international and national government agencies. Any international or national reallocation of frequency bands, including frequency bands segmentation and band spectrum sharing, or other modifications concerning the regulation of frequency bands, could significantly disrupt or degrade the utility and reliability of our GPS-based products, which could negatively affect our ability to develop and market GPS-based technology solutions.\nIn addition, disruptions with GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to supply the bandwidth we need to support our products could interfere with the speed, availability, and usability of our equipment and services. If these GPS signals or RF signals become unavailable, our customers could be unable to use their equipment indefinitely. For our agricultural customers, this could result in lower crop yields, decreased operational efficiency, and higher equipment maintenance, seed, fertilizer, fuel, and wage costs. For construction customers, this could result in higher fuel and equipment maintenance costs, as well as lower construction design and project management efficiencies. These cost increases could significantly reduce customers profitability, sustainability, and demand for our products. As a result, our sales and revenue could significantly decrease, which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our business.\nOur ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe compete in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets with other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. In addition, our industry is attracting non-traditional competitors, including technology-focused companies and start-up ventures. We compete on product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and price. Aggressive pricing or other strategies of competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or our failure to price products competitively could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of our products and services. If dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations, it could have an adverse effect on our overall sales and revenue.\nWe rely on the capability of our dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that dealers purchase from us. If our dealers are unsuccessful in these endeavors, we will be unable to grow our sales and revenue, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nIn addition, the dealer channels ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers acceptance and adoption rates of these products. The unavailability of specialized technicians to service our equipment may result in overburdening dealers servicing capacity.\nDealers may have trouble funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors. Dealers may exit or we may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs. The unplanned loss of any of our dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage, negative customer impressions, and may adversely impact our ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer.\nENVIRONMENTAL, CLIMATE, AND WEATHER RISKS\nUnfavorable weather conditions or natural catastrophes that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect our business.\nThe purchasing decisions of our customers, particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment, can be significantly affected by poor or unusual weather conditions. Such conditions include:\n\u25cf Insufficient levels of rain, which prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields;\n\u25cf Excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth;\n\u25cf Temperatures outside normal ranges, which can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence;\n\u25cf Natural disasters such as regional floods, hurricanes or other storms, droughts, diseases, wildfires, and pests, either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise, which have had, and could in the future have, significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production;\n\u25cf Adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region, particularly during the important spring selling season; and\n\u25cf Drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and can similarly cause lower sales volume.\nEach of these conditions could have a negative impact on farm income which can affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our dealers and customers.\nGovernmental actions designed to address climate change based on the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lower-carbon economy could adversely affect John Deere and our customers.\nThere is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to alter the composition of Earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate. These considerations have led to new international, national, regional, and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders, and non-governmental organizations, as well as companies in many business sectors, including us, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. The regulation of GHG emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to us in the form of taxes or emission allowances, required facilities improvements, and increased energy costs. These results would increase our operating costs through higher utility, transportation, and materials cost and could prevent us from selling products into certain markets. Increased input costs, such as fuel and fertilizer, and compliance-related costs could also affect customer operations and demand for our equipment.\nFurther, our financial services segment is subject to additional international and national European regulations relating to climate and environmental risk, which are continually evolving and could affect the financing operations and climate-risk processes developed by the segment. Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts. The EU recently adopted the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will impose disclosure of the risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues, and on the impact of companies activities on people and the environment. The CSRD will need to be transposed into Member State law before it becomes effective, which is expected to occur in 2024. Similarly, the State of California recently passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us, starting in 2026. The SEC has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that, if adopted, could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity.\nIncreasingly stringent engine emission regulations or bans on internal combustion engines may impact our ability to manufacture and distribute certain engines or equipment, which could negatively affect business results.\nOur equipment operations must meet increasingly stringent engine emission reduction regulations throughout the world, including the European Unions Stage V standard, which limits the amount of certain substances in exhaust gases that off-road engines can emit into the environment. Governmental agencies throughout the world are enacting more stringent laws and regulations to reduce off-road engine emissions. These laws and regulations are applicable to engines we manufacture, including those used in agriculture and CF equipment.\nWe have incurred, and continue to incur, substantial research and development costs related to the implementation of these more rigorous laws and regulations. While we have developed and are executing comprehensive plans to meet these requirements, these plans are subject to variables that could delay or otherwise affect our ability to manufacture and distribute certain equipment or engines, which could negatively impact business results. Additionally, in certain locations governments have banned, or may in the future ban, internal combustion engines for some types of products completely. To the extent these bans affect products manufactured and sold by us, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be negatively affected.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nChanges in government banking, monetary, and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on us.\nPolicies of the U.S. and other governments regarding banking, monetary, and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity, stabilize financial markets, and/or address local deficit or structural economic issues could have a material impact on our customers and markets. Central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year 2023. Most of our retail receivables are fixed rate, while wholesale financing receivables are variable rate. We have both fixed and variable rate borrowings. Historically, rising interest rates impact our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios.\nOur operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could, among other things, have an adverse effect on the financial services segment and on our customers by limiting their ability to enter hedging transactions or to finance purchases of our products. Government policies on spending can also affect us, especially the CF segment, due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development. Our operations, including those outside of the U.S., may also be affected by non-U.S. regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate non-U.S. financial institutions and markets.\nChanges in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur consolidated financial results are reported in U.S. dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in foreign currencies, creating currency exchange and translation risk.\nWe are a global company with transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn our revenues.\nAdditionally, the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. Certain of our assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies, which are then translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates and reported in our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value remains unchanged in the original currencies. While the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates. In Argentina, we have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. These mechanisms are short-term in nature, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations.\nChanges in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect our financials and our earnings and/or cash flows.\nCentral bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year 2023. Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for our equipment and customers ability to repay their obligations to us. Rising interest rates may cause credit market\ndislocations, that can impact funding costs, which can affect the financial services segments ability to offer customers competitive financing rates. While we strive to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities, changing interest rates have had an adverse effect on our net interest rate margin-the difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for funding, which has affected our net interest income and earnings.\nIn addition, actions by credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for us and can increase our costs of capital and hurt our competitive position.\nBecause the financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide, negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact our operations and financial results.\nNegative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which the financial services segment operates. The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide. The financial services segment is exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed our expectations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. The financial services segments inability to access funds at cost-effective rates to support our financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business. The financial services segments liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities. Additionally, negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels, resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could materially impact the financial services segments write-offs and provision for credit losses. The financial services segment may also experience residual value losses that exceed our expectations caused by lower pricing for used equipment and higher-than-expected equipment returns at lease maturity.\nWe may sustain increases in funding obligations under our pension plans which may impair our liquidity or financial condition.\nWe maintain certain defined benefit pension plans for certain employees, which impose funding obligations. We use various assumptions in calculating our future payment obligations under these plans. Significant adverse changes in credit or market conditions could result in actual rates of return on pension investments being lower than expected. Regulatory changes could cause a deterioration in the statutory funded status of our plans. We may be required to make significant contributions to our pension plans in the future. These factors could significantly increase our payment obligations under the plans and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nMANUFACTURING AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast customer demand for products and services, and to adequately manage inventory, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and expenses and place orders sufficiently in advance with suppliers and contract manufacturers. These forecasts are based on estimates of future demand for products and services. Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand, parts shortages, manufacturing delays, increased costs, or excess inventory. In fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions resulted in higher inventory levels. Although production schedules in fiscal year 2023 were more aligned with the customers seasonal use of our products, marking a return to historical seasonal production patterns, our ability to accurately forecast demand in the future could be affected by many factors, including changes in customer demand for our products and services, changes in demand for the products and services of competitors, unanticipated changes in general market conditions, and the weakening of economic conditions or customer confidence in future economic conditions. If the forecasts used to manage inventory are not accurate, we may experience excess inventory levels, shortage of available products, or reduced manufacturing efficiencies.\nChanges in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions, increased costs, and lower profits on sales of our products.\nWe require access to various raw materials, components, and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute our products. The price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last 36 months. For example, in fiscal year 2022, supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of our business, including receiving past due deliveries from suppliers, parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels. We experienced supply chain improvements in fiscal year 2023 with a return to normal in the second half of the fiscal year.\nWhile we have seen stabilization in the supply chain and some commodity pricing improvements, we anticipate potential fluctuations due to inflation, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, and regulatory and policy instability, including import tariffs and trade agreements. The latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of the business, particularly if we are unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other\nfactors. We have experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials, components, whole goods, and freight over the past several years, especially in fiscal years 2021 and 2022.Global logistics network challenges resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, increased transportation costs, and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory, which increased our overall production and overhead costs. Increases in such costs have had an adverse effect on our business operations.\nWe rely on our suppliers to acquire the raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture their products. Significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials, components, and whole goods have and could continue to adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to our customers. In addition, certain materials and components used in our products are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously. Furthermore, if our customers are unwilling to accept price increases for our products, or if we are unable to offset the increases in costs, raw material costs or shortages could have a material adverse effect on our operational or financial results.\nDisputes with labor unions may adversely affect our ability to operate in our facilities as well as impact our financial results.\nMany of our production and maintenance employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with different expiration dates. Our failure to successfully renegotiate labor agreements as they expire has from time to time led, and could in the future lead, to work stoppages or other disputes with labor unions. For example, the UAW initiated a labor strike that had an adverse effect on our results of operations in fiscal 2022 because of reduced productions and shipments. Certain of our labor agreements expire as early as 2024. Disruptions to our manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes could adversely affect us. Any strike, work stoppage, or other dispute with a labor union distracts management from operating the business, may displace employees from ordinary job positions to fill in vacant positions, may affect our reputation, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business may suffer if our equipment fails to perform as expected.\nIf our equipment does not perform as expected, we may receive warranty claims and have to perform post-sales repairs or recalls. We may also be subject to regulatory requirements and penalties that will impact our ability to develop, market, and sell equipment. This may result in product delivery delays. It could also lead to product liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims. These claims and warranty expenses could be significant. As a manufacturer of equipment, we must manage the cost and risk associated with product warranties, post-sale repairs and recalls, regulatory penalties, and product liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims with respect to our products. In addition to post-sale repairs or recalls initiated by us for various reasons, investigations into our products by government regulators may compel us to initiate product recalls or may result in negative public perceptions about the safety of our products, even if we disagree with the regulators determination. Such post-sale repairs or recalls, whether voluntary or involuntary, could result in significant expense, supply chain complications, and may harm our brand, business, prospects, financial condition, and operating results.\nRESOURCES RISKS\nOur ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could affect our ability to execute our strategy.\nOur continued success depends, in part, on our ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education, background, and experience as well as our ability to develop, engage, and retain qualified employees. Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees, whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants, difficulty in recruiting new employees, or inadequate resources to train, integrate, and retain qualified employees, could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, while we strive to reduce the impact of the departure of employees, our operations or ability to execute our business strategy and meet our business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees, particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees, such as those we could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs. Higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale, the loss of knowledge of departing employees, and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise our information as well as information of our employees, customers, suppliers, and/or dealers, exposing us to liability that could cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit, and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including supply chain, manufacturing, distribution, invoicing, and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of our equipment and from customers of the financial services segment. We use information technology systems to record, process, and\nsummarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting, legal, and tax requirements.\nAdditionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, and the proprietary business information of our customers, suppliers, and dealers, as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks. The secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy.\nDespite security measures, including a vulnerability disclosure program, and business continuity plans, our information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion, damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, employees, suppliers, or dealers error or malfeasance, supply chain compromise, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters, or other events. Although we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in material business impact, we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors. The occurrence of any significant event could compromise our networks, and the information stored there could be accessed, obtained, publicly disclosed, lost, altered, misused, or stolen. Any such access, disclosure, alteration, misuse, or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, government investigations, liability or regulatory penalties, disruption or shut down of our operations, and damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Furthermore, as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication, we may need to invest additional resources to protect information security.\nAny unauthorized control or manipulation of our products systems could result in loss of confidence in us and our products.\nSome of our products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates. While we have implemented security measures intended to protect against unauthorized remote access to these products, malicious threat actors have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products in order to gain control of the products, change the products functionality, user interface, or performance characteristics, interfere with the products operations, or gain access to data stored in or generated by the products or to systems to which they connect. In addition, reports of unauthorized access to our products, systems, and data, regardless of their reliability, may result in the perception that the products, systems, or data are vulnerable to malicious or unauthorized modifications. Any unauthorized access to or control of our products or systems, any loss of data, or any perception that products, systems, or data are vulnerable could result in legal claims or proceedings against us, government investigations, liability, or regulatory penalties, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the infringement or loss of intellectual property rights.\nWe protect our intellectual property with a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, and legal agreements. We heavily rely on certain trademarks to protect our identity and customer recognition of our products and services, including, but not limited to, the John Deere mark, the leaping deer logo, the Nothing Runs Like a Deere slogan, and the green and yellow color combination. These trademarks, as well as the many patents that protect innovations used in our products, are integral to our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAdditionally, third parties may initiate legal proceedings to challenge the validity of our intellectual property or allege that we infringe on their intellectual property. We may incur substantial costs if third parties initiate such legal proceedings, or if we initiate legal proceedings to protect or enforce our intellectual property. If the outcome of any such legal proceedings is unfavorable to us, our business could be adversely affected.\nLEGAL AND COMPLIANCE RISKS\nOur global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects.\nWe are subject to numerous international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, many of which are complex, frequently changing, and subject to varying interpretations. These laws and regulations cover a variety of subjects, including advertising, anti-money laundering, antitrust, consumer finance, environmental, climate-related, health and safety, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign ownership and investment, import/export and trade, human rights, labor and employment, product liability reporting, cybersecurity, data privacy, telematics, and connectivity.\nThese laws may vary substantially within the different markets in which we operate. Compliance with these laws and regulations is expensive and may further increase the cost of conducting our global operations. In addition, we must comply with the U.S. Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act and all applicable foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. These laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage, regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction. Although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nChanges to existing laws and regulations, or changes to how they are interpreted, or the implementation of new, more stringent laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers. Legislative and regulatory changes, and other actions that could potentially affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures.\nWe are subject to governmental laws, regulations, and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection. Any inability or perceived inability of addressing these requirements could adversely affect our business.\nThe legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We collect personal information and other data as integral parts of our business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including the EU, China, Canada, and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the China Personal Information Protection Law, among others, impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance. New privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future. Any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns (even if unfounded), or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect our business.\nLegal proceedings and disputes in which we are, and may in the future be, involved could harm our business, financial condition, reputation, and brand.\nWe routinely are a party to claims and legal actions incidental to our business. These include claims for personal injury or property by users of our equipment, environmental, health, and safety claims, disputes with distributors, vendors and others with respect to commercial matters, and disputes with taxing and other governmental authorities regarding the conduct of our business. The defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations.\nWe are currently subject to a consolidated multidistrict class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that we have engaged in attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct, and restraint of the market for repair services for John Deere brand agricultural equipment by limiting repair resources only to our authorized technicians or independent authorized John Deere dealers. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating whether we have violated laws in connection with the repair of John Deere brand agriculture equipment, as well as our information security practices and statements as they relate to the risk of unauthorized access to our computer systems, products, and services. We are fully cooperating with the FTC. We are currently unable to predict the outcome of these matters. The development and resolution of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results.\nGENERAL RISKS\nOur reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity.\nOur brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of our business. Our reputation is critical to growing our customer base. Our brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business, including the core values of integrity, quality, innovation, and commitment. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our products or services, our culture and values, our stance on environmental, social, and governance topics, customer data, or any of our key employees or suppliers, could damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. In addition, our stance on environmental, social, and governance topics damage to our reputation could adversely impact the ability to attract new and maintain existing customers, employees, dealers, and business relationships. For example, we have been the subject of negative media articles relating to our customers right to maintain and safely repair their equipment.\nAdditionally, negative or inaccurate postings, articles, or comments on social media and the internet about us could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of our brand. Further, adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or legal proceedings initiated by us, could also damage our reputation and brand image, undermine customer confidence, and reduce long-term demand for equipment, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations. If the reputation, culture, or image of our brands are damaged, or we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nUnexpected events have increased and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations.\nThe occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including war, acts of terrorism, epidemics and pandemics (such as the COVID pandemic), civil unrest, fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other forms of severe weather in the United States or in other countries in which we operate, or in which our suppliers are located, have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Such events have caused and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruptions in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers, and disruption and delay in the transport of products to dealers, end-users, and distribution centers. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events.\nThe potential physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers, and customers, and therefore on our operations, are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions. These potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for our products and the cost, production, sales, and financial performance of our operations. ITEM 1B.\nUNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS.\nNone. ITEM 2.\nPROPERTIES.\nIn the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own and operate 23 factory locations and lease and operate another 3 locations. Outside of the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations own or lease and operate 45 factory locations in Argentina, Austria, Brazil, China, Finland, France, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Spain.\nIn addition, the equipment operations own or lease 12 facilities comprised of three locations supporting centralized parts distribution and nine regional parts depots and distribution centers throughout the U.S. and Canada. Outside the U.S. and Canada, the equipment operations also own or lease and occupy 11 total facilities with centralized parts distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, and India and regional parts depots and distribution centers in Argentina, Australia, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. We also own or lease eight facilities for the manufacture and distribution of other brands of replacement parts.\nOur manufacturing facility in Russia was shut down in 2022. Our Eurasian parts distribution center in Russia was also closed, and the leased premises were returned to the landlord in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. Premises owned by Wirtgen in Russia operating in the roadbuilding business were sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023.\nWe own or lease 53 administrative offices and research facilities globally as well as many other smaller, miscellaneous facilities.\nOverall, we own approximately 70.0 million square feet of facilities and lease approximately 13.1 million additional square feet in various locations. These properties are adequate and suitable for our business as presently conducted and are well maintained. ITEM 3.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\nWe are subject to various unresolved legal actions that arise in the normal course of business, the most prevalent of which relate to product liability (including asbestos related liability), retail credit, employment, patent, trademark, and antitrust matters. Currently we believe the reasonably possible range of losses for other unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our financial statements; however, the outcome of any current or future proceedings, claims, or investigations cannot be predicted with certainty. Adverse decisions in one or more of these proceedings, claims, or investigations could require us to pay substantial damages or fines, undertake service actions, initiate recall campaigns, or take other costly actions. It is therefore possible that legal judgements could give rise to expenses that are not covered, or not fully covered by our insurance programs and could affect our financial position and results. ITEM 4.\nMINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES.\nNot applicable.\nPART II ITEM 5.\nMARKET FOR REGISTRANTS COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.\n(a) Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol DE. We have a history of paying quarterly cash dividends. While we currently expect a cash dividend to be paid in the future, future dividend payments will depend on our earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, and other factors considered relevant by our Board of Directors. See the information concerning the number of stockholders in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b) Not applicable.\n(c) Purchases of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2023 were as follows:\nISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES\nMaximum\nTotal Number of\nNumber of Shares\nShares Purchased\nthat May Yet Be\nTotal Number of\nas Part of Publicly\nPurchased under\nShares\nAnnounced Plans\nthe Plans or\nPurchased (2)\nAverage Price\nor Programs (1)\nPrograms (1)\nPeriod\n(thousands)\nPer Share\n(thousands)\n(millions)\nJul 31 to Aug 27\n$\n424.30\n42.3\nAug 28 to Sept 24\n2,204\n410.43\n2,204\n39.8\nSept 25 to Oct 29\n3,593\n384.94\n3,593\n35.9\nTotal\n6,479\n6,478\n(1) We have a share repurchase plan that was announced in December 2022 to purchase up to $18.0 billion of shares of our common stock. The maximum number of shares that may yet be repurchased under this plan was 35.9 million based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE as of the end of the fourth quarter of $361.15 per share. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, $13.0 billion of common stock remains to be repurchased under this plan.\n(2) In the fourth quarter of 2023, 1 thousand shares were acquired from a plan participant at a market price of $431.68 to pay payroll taxes on the vesting of a restricted stock award.\nSTOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe graph compares the total shareholder returns (TSR) of Deere & Company, the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Construction Machinery & Heavy Transportation Equipment Index, the S&P 500 Industrials, and the S&P 500 Stock Index over a five-year period. It assumes $100 was invested on October 26, 2018 and that dividends were reinvested. Our stock price at October 27, 2023, was $361.15. Going forward, we intend to use the S&P 500 Industrials to replace the S&P 500 Construction Machinery & Heavy Transportation Equipment. We believe the S&P 500 Industrials provides a better benchmark to compare our cumulative total returns against the industry because it comprises those companies included in the S&P 500 that are classified as members of the GICS industrials sector, and therefore, have many characteristics similar to us, regardless of the specific types of products they offer. In contrast, the S&Ps 500 Construction Machinery & Heavy Transportation Equipment Index is made up of only four companies (Caterpillar (CAT), Cummins (CMI), Paccar (PCAR), and Wabtec (WAB)). The stock performance shown in the graph is not intended to forecast and does not necessarily indicate future price performance.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. All amounts are presented in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified. For comparison of 2022 to 2021 results, refer to the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nDeere & Company is a global leader in the production of agricultural, turf, construction, and forestry equipment and solutions. John Deere Financial provides financing for John Deere equipment, parts, service, and other input costs customers need to run their operations. Our operations are managed through the production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services operating segments. References to equipment operations include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to agriculture and turf include both PPA and SAT.\nNet Sales and Revenues by Segment in 2023\nSmart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions\nWe announced the Smart Industrial Operating Model in 2020. This operating model is based on three focus areas:\n(a) Production systems: A strategic alignment of products and solutions around our customers operations.\n(b) Technology stack: Investments in technology, as well as research and development, that deliver intelligent solutions to our customers through digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies.\n(c) Lifecycle solutions: The integration of our aftermarket and support capabilities to more effectively manage customer equipment, service, and technology needs across the full lifetime of a John Deere product.\nOur Leap Ambitions were launched in 2022. These ambitions are designed to boost economic value and sustainability for our customers. The ambitions align across our customers production systems seeking to optimize their operations to deliver better outcomes with fewer resources.\nTRENDS & ECONOMIC CONDITIONS\nIndustry Sales Outlook for Fiscal 2024\nCompany Trends - Customers seek to improve profitability, productivity, and sustainability through technology. Integration of technology into equipment is a persistent market trend. Our Smart Industrial Operating Model and Leap Ambitions are intended to capitalize on this market trend. These technologies are incorporated into products within each of our operating segments. We expect this trend to persist for the foreseeable future. The investments in these technologies and in establishing a Solutions as a Service business model might increase our operating costs and may decrease operating margins during the transition period. Most notably in 2023, we introduced See & Spray\u2122 Ultimate and a new model of See & Spray\u2122 Premium. These technologies were introduced on a limited basis and did not represent a significant percentage of our sales in 2023.\nCompany Outlook for 2024\n\u25cf Demand is expected to decline in 2024.\n\u25cf Production volumes will decline to more normal levels in 2024.\nAgriculture and Turf Outlook for 2024\n\u25cf We expect large agricultural equipment sales to decline in 2024 in North America, Europe, and South America.\n\u25cf Demand for small agricultural equipment is expected to moderate in Europe.\n\u25cf Turf and utility equipment product sales are expected to be lower due to the overall U.S. economic condition and elevated interest rates.\nMarket Conditions:\n\u25cf Agricultural fundamentals are expected to moderate in 2024 due to lower commodity prices and elevated interest rates, offset by declining input costs and improved customer financials.\n\u25cf The dairy and livestock sector continues to benefit from elevated protein and hay prices.\n\u25cf Farm input costs in Europe are declining. Grain prices vary from favorable in Western Europe to depressed in Eastern Europe due to the Russia/Ukraine war.\n\u25cf Dealer inventories are elevated in Brazil due to inventory oversupply driven by weakening demand in the second half of 2023.\n\u25cf Industry sales in Asia are impacted by moderating demand in India, the worlds largest tractor market by number of units.\n\u25cf The fleet average age is older than in prior business cycles. Combines are in line with the historical average age, while tractors are slightly older than historical averages.\nConstruction and Forestry Outlook for 2024\nMarket Conditions:\n\u25cf Construction equipment industry sales are forecasted to be down from 2023 levels.\n\u25cf Benefits from rental fleet replenishment, the energy industry, and U.S. infrastructure spending are expected to partially offset moderation in residential home, office, and retail construction.\n\u25cf Roadbuilding demand remains strong, similar to 2023 in the U.S., largely offset by softening demand in Europe.\nFinancial Services Outlook for 2024\nNet Income\nUp moderately\n+ Nonrecurring prior period special items\nFavorable\n+ Higher average portfolio\nFavorable\n(-) Financing spreads\nUnfavorable\n(-) Recoveries on operating lease dispositions\nUnfavorable\nAdditional Trends - We experienced supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures in 2022. While these issues moderated in 2023, the effect on production schedules and central bank policy interest rates continued in 2023. These changes are discussed below.\nSupply Chain Impact on Production Schedules. We experienced supply chain improvements compared to 2022, with a return to normal in 2023. The ease in supply chain disruptions contributed to higher levels of production compared to prior year. As a result, our production schedules in 2023 were more aligned with the customers seasonal use of our products, marking a return to historical seasonal production patterns and on-time product delivery. Additionally, supply chain improvements contributed to reductions in premium freight costs, moderation in material cost increases, and disciplined inventory management in 2023. In 2022, supply chain disruptions impacted many aspects of our business, including receiving past due deliveries from suppliers, parts availability, increased production costs, and higher inventory levels.\nInterest Rates. Central bank policy interest rates increased in 2022 and 2023. Increased rates impacted us in several ways, primarily affecting the financing spreads for the financial services operations, and may impact future demand for our products.\nMost retail customer receivables are fixed rate. Wholesale financing receivables generally are variable rate. Both types of\nreceivables are financed with fixed and floating rate borrowings. We manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by matching our receivables with our funding sources. We also enter into interest rate swap agreements to match our interest rate exposure.\nRising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from receivable and lease portfolios. As a result, our financial services operations experienced $170 (after-tax) less favorable financing spreads in 2023 compared to 2022. If interest rates continue to rise, we expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024.\nDemand for our products is negatively impacted by rising interest rates. We expect higher borrowing costs for our customers to primarily affect discretionary and residential product sales in 2024.\nRising interest rates are driven by factors outside of our control, and as a result, we cannot reasonably foresee when this condition will subside.\nAgricultural Market Business Cycle. The agricultural market is affected by various factors including commodity prices, acreage planted, crop yields, and government policies. These factors affect farmers income and may result in lower demand for equipment. We may experience any of the following effects during unfavorable market conditions: lower net sales, higher sales discounts, higher receivable write-offs, or losses on equipment on operating leases. A potential benefit is that customers may invest in integrated technology solutions and precision agriculture to lower input costs and improve margins.\nOther Items of Concern and Uncertainties - Other items that could impact our results are:\n\u25cf global and regional political conditions, including the war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war,\n\u25cf economic, tax, and trade policies,\n\u25cf new or retaliatory tariffs,\n\u25cf capital market disruptions,\n\u25cf foreign currency and capital control policies,\n\u25cf regulations and legislation regarding right to repair,\n\u25cf weather conditions,\n\u25cf marketplace adoption and monetization of technologies we have invested in,\n\u25cf our ability to strengthen our digital capabilities, automation, autonomy, and alternative power technologies,\n\u25cf changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment,\n\u25cf significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,\n\u25cf volatility in the prices of many commodities, and\n\u25cf slower economic growth or possible recession.\nCONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n2023 compared to 2022\nHighlights\n\u25cf Net income rose in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by strong market conditions.\n\u25cf We continue to focus on structural profitability and strategically investing in solutions that deliver value to our customers.\nNet Sales and Revenues\nNet Sales (Equipment Operations)\n\u25cf Favorable industry fundamentals and strong demand for farm and construction equipment drove the sales increases in 2023.\nNet Income (Attributable to Deere & Company)\nDiluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) ($ per share)\n\u25cf Net income and diluted EPS grew at a faster rate than sales due to our ability to keep cost increases below price realization.\nOther Significant Statement of Consolidated Income Changes -\nAn explanation of the cost of sales to net sales ratio and other significant statement of consolidated income changes follows:\nDeere & Company\n% Change\nCost of sales to net sales\n67.9%\n73.7%\n+ Price realization\nFavorable\n(-) Production costs\nUnfavorable\nPrice realization was 12 percent driven by strong demand. Production costs increased due to a moderate rise in material cost and manufacturing overhead. These factors were partially offset by lower freight costs and production efficiencies generated by easing supply chain disruptions.\nOther income\n$\n1,003\n$\n1,295\nOther income was lower due to a non-cash gain on the remeasurement of the previously held equity investment in the Deere-Hitachi joint venture in 2022.\nResearch and development expenses\n2,177\n1,912\n+14\nResearch and development expenditures were higher due to continued focus on developing new technology solutions and new product introductions.\nSelling, administrative and general expenses\n4,595\n3,863\n+19\nSelling, administrative and general expenses rose due to higher salary expenses driven by inflationary conditions, profit-sharing incentives, and an increase in expenses to support the Leap Ambitions framework. Also impacting the current year was a cumulative correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers (see Note 4).\nInterest expense\n2,453\n1,062\n+131\nInterest expense increased due to higher average borrowing rates and higher average borrowings.\nOther operating expenses\n1,292\n1,275\n+1\nSee Note 9 for more information.\nProvision for income taxes\n2,871\n2,007\n+43\nConsistent with higher pretax income.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n2023 compared to 2022\nEach equipment operation segment experienced price realization during 2023, as orderbooks were full and most product lines were on allocation. These factors contributed to higher shipment volumes for large agriculture and construction equipment.\nProduction costs were unfavorable in 2023 due to higher material costs, profit-sharing incentive compensation, and manufacturing overhead costs, partially offset by lower freight costs and improved production efficiency. Material costs were higher in the first three quarters of 2023 but continued to moderate through the year. In the fourth quarter of 2023, material costs were lower than in the prior year.\nProduction and Precision Agriculture Operations\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n26,790\n$\n22,002\n+22\nSales volume and other\n+7\nPrice realization\n+15\nCurrency translation\nOperating profit\n6,996\n4,386\n+60\nOperating margin\n26.1%\n19.9%\nSales volumes increased 10 percent in the U.S. and Canada, 32 percent in Australia, and 9 percent in Western Europe, partially offset by the effect of suspension of shipments to Russia. Price realization was 17 percent in the U.S. and Canada and 12 percent outside the U.S. and Canada, driven by strong demand. Prior period results were impacted by special items (see Note 4).\nSmall Agriculture and Turf Operations\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n13,980\n$\n13,381\n+4\nSales volume and other\nPrice realization\n+9\nCurrency translation\nOperating profit\n2,472\n1,949\n+27\nOperating margin\n17.7%\n14.6%\nSales volumes decreased 8 percent in the U.S. and Canada but increased 18 percent in Mexico and 2 percent in Western Europe.\nPrice realization was 8 percent in the U.S. and Canada driven by inflation and 12 percent in Western Europe driven by strong demand.\nConstruction and Forestry Operations\n% Change\nNet sales\n$\n14,795\n$\n12,534\n+18\nSales volume and other\n+9\nPrice realization\n+10\nCurrency translation\nOperating profit\n2,695\n2,014\n+34\nOperating margin\n18.2%\n16.1%\nSales volumes increased 18 percent in the U.S. and Canada but decreased 6 percent outside the U.S. and Canada driven by lower sales in Brazil and the suspension of shipments to Russia. Price realization was 12 percent in the U.S. and Canada driven by strong demand, and 7 percent outside the U.S. and Canada. Results in both periods were impacted by special items (see Note 4).\nFinancial Services Operations\n% Change\nRevenue (including intercompany)\n$\n5,554\n$\n4,085\n+36\nAverage balance of receivables and leases\n+19\nInterest expense\n2,362\n+196\nAverage borrowings\n+20\nAverage borrowing rates\n+143\nNet income\nAverage wholesale receivables increased 72 percent and retail notes increased 13 percent driven by higher equipment sales. Revenue also increased due to higher average financing rates. Net income declined as a result of unfavorable financing spreads and a correction of the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers (see Note 4). In 2022, financial services increased the provision for credit losses in Russia and recorded an intercompany benefit from the equipment operations, which guarantees financial services investments in certain international markets, including Russia (see Note 4). The Russia-related impacts are displayed in the Other bar below.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n2022 compared to 2021\nPlease refer to the Managements Discussion and Analysis section of our 2022 Form 10-K.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY\n2023 compared to 2022\nWe have access to global markets at a reasonable cost. Sources of liquidity include:\n\u25cf cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand,\n\u25cf funds from operations,\n\u25cf the issuance of commercial paper and term debt,\n\u25cf the securitization of retail notes, and\n\u25cf bank lines of credit.\nWe closely monitor our cash requirements. Based on the available sources of liquidity, we expect to meet our funding needs in the short term (next 12 months) and long term (beyond 12 months). We\nare forecasting lower operating cash flows in 2024 compared with 2023 as identified previously in Trends and Economic Conditions.\nWe operate in multiple industries, which have unique funding requirements. The equipment operations are capital intensive. Historically, these operations have been subject to seasonal variations in financing requirements for inventories and receivables from dealers. However, the patterns of seasonality have been affected by the supply chain disruptions experienced during fiscal year 2022.\nThe financial services operations rely on their ability to raise substantial amounts of funds to finance their receivable and lease portfolios.\nKey Metrics and Balance Sheet Changes\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\n\u25cf See the detailed cash flow discussion in the next section.\n\u25cf The increase was primarily driven by higher operating cash flow.\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable - Net\n\u25cf Receivables are generated from the sales of goods to customers.\n\u25cf The increase was driven by higher sales.\nFinancing Receivables and Equipment on Operating Leases\n\u25cf Acquisition volumes were 30 percent higher driven by higher retail volumes due to increased retail sales and higher wholesale receivables.\nInventories\n\u25cf Inventories decreased due to easing of supply disruption constraints and moderation of future demand.\nProperty and Equipment\n\u25cf Cash expenditures were $1.5 billion in 2023.\n\u25cf Capital expenditures are forecast to be $1.9 billion in 2024.\nBorrowings\n\u25cf Borrowings increased corresponding with the level of the financing receivable and lease portfolios.\nUnused Credit Lines\n\u25cf The decrease in unused credit lines was due to an increase in commercial paper outstanding to fund growth in the receivable portfolios.\nFinancial Services Ratio of Interest-Bearing Debt to Stockholders Equity\nCASH FLOWS\n2023, 2022, and 2021\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n8,589\n$\n4,699\n$\n7,726\nNet cash used for investing activities\n(8,749)\n(8,485)\n(5,750)\nNet cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n2,808\n(1,078)\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n(224)\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n2,679\n$\n(3,184)\n$\nOperating cash flows in 2023 were higher due to an increase in net income and lower inventory offset by higher receivables related to sales, while operating cash flows in 2022 were impacted by a $1 billion other postretirement benefit (OPEB) contribution.\nCash outflows from investing activities were $8.7 billion in 2023 due to growth in the financing receivable and lease portfolios, and purchases of property and equipment.\nCash inflows from financing activities were $2.8 billion in 2023, as higher borrowings were partially offset by repurchases of common stock and dividends paid.\nCash Returned to Shareholders\nCash returned to shareholders increased $3.7 billion in 2023.\nDEBT RATINGS\nTo access debt markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings to our debt. These ratings are an indicator of credit quality for fixed income investors. A debt rating is not a recommendation by the rating agency to buy, sell, or hold. A credit rating agency may change or withdraw company ratings based on its assessment of our current and future ability to meet interest and principal repayment obligations. Lower credit ratings or negative changes to ratings outlooks generally result in higher borrowing costs, including costs of derivative transactions, and reduced access to debt capital markets, and may adversely impact our liquidity.\nThe senior long-term and short-term debt ratings and outlook currently assigned to unsecured company securities by the rating agencies engaged by us are as follows:\nSenior\nLong-Term\nShort-Term\nOutlook\nFitch Ratings\nA+\nStable\nMoodys Investors Service, Inc.\nA2\nPrime-1\nPositive\nStandard & Poors\nA\nA-1\nStable\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND CASH REQUIREMENTS\n2024 and Beyond\nOur material cash requirements include the following:\nBorrowings - As of October 29, 2023, we had $21.2 billion of payments due on borrowings and securitization borrowings in the next year, along with interest payments of $2.2 billion. The securitization borrowing payments are based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes. See Notes 12 and 19 for additional borrowing details. These payments will likely be replaced with new borrowings to finance the receivable and lease portfolio, which is expected to grow in 2024.\nPurchase Obligations - As of October 29, 2023, our outstanding purchase obligations were $4.5 billion, with $4.1 billion payable within one year. These purchase obligations are noncancelable.\nOther Cash Requirements - In addition to our contractual obligations, we have the following commitments:\n\u25cf capital expenditures of $1.9 billion are planned for 2024,\n\u25cf expected quarterly cash dividend throughout 2024 (subject to change at the discretion of our Board of Directors), and\n\u25cf total pension and OPEB contributions in 2024 are expected to be approximately $225.\nShare repurchases will be considered as a means of deploying excess cash to shareholders, once the previously mentioned requirements are met.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe timely preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions. Those estimates affect reported amounts in these financial statements. Changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect. The following estimates are the most critical to our financial statements:\n\u25cf sales incentives,\n\u25cf product warranties,\n\u25cf postretirement benefit obligations,\n\u25cf allowance for credit losses,\n\u25cf operating lease residual values, and\n\u25cf income taxes.\nThese items require the most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments. Our accounting policies are described primarily in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements.\nSales Incentives\nWe provide sales incentives to dealers. These incentives are offered in two forms:\n\u25cf volume bonuses - awarded based on a dealers sales volume and performance, and\n\u25cf retail sales incentive programs - discounts or financing programs that are due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer.\nThe estimated cost of these programs is based on:\n\u25cf historical data,\n\u25cf announced and expected incentive programs,\n\u25cf field inventory levels, and\n\u25cf forecasted sales volumes.\nAt the time a sale is recognized, we record an estimate of the sales incentive costs. The final cost is determined at the end of the volume bonus measurement period or at the time of the retail sale.\nThere are numerous programs available at any time, and new programs may be announced after we record the equipment sale to the dealer. Changes in the mix and types of sales incentive programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in Net sales.\nSales Incentive Accruals\nThe accruals recorded against receivables relate to programs where we have the contractual right and the intent to offset against existing receivables. The increase in each of 2023 and 2022 primarily resulted from higher retail sales. Additional factors in\n2023 were higher incentives for dealer market share and incentives provided to offset elevated interest rates.\nA key assumption of the retail sales incentive accrual is the predictive value of the historical percent of retail sales incentive costs to retail sales. Over the last five fiscal years, this percent has varied by an average of .7 percent. Holding other assumptions constant, .7 percent change would have modified the sales incentive accrual by $105.\nProduct Warranties\nA standard warranty is provided as an assurance that our equipment will function as intended. The standard warranty period varies by product and region.\nAt the time a sale is recognized, we record an estimate of future warranty costs, based on the following calculation:\n\u25cf historical claims rate experience - multiplied by -\n\u25cf the estimated population.\nThe historical claims rate is determined by a review of five-year claims costs. The estimated population is based on dealer inventories and retail sales. These estimates are reviewed quarterly. Adjustments are also made for current quality developments.\nProduct Warranty Accruals\nThe increase in each of 2023 and 2022 related to higher sales volumes, partially offset by a decrease in the warranty rate.\nProduct warranty accrual estimates are affected by the historical percent of warranty claims costs as a percentage of gross sales. During this time, the percent has varied plus or minus .12 percent. Holding all other assumptions constant, if this estimated cost experience percent would have increased or decreased .12 percent, the warranty accrual at October 29, 2023 would have changed by approximately $81.\nPostretirement Benefit Obligations\nThe pension and OPEB plan obligations (defined benefit) and expenses require the use of estimates. The main estimate is the present value of the projected future benefit payments. These future benefit payments extend several decades.\nThe estimates are based on existing retirement plan provisions. No assumption is made regarding any potential changes to benefit provisions beyond those to which we are presently committed (e.g., in existing labor contracts).\nThe key assumptions used by our actuaries to calculate the estimates include:\n\u25cf discount rates,\n\u25cf health care cost trend rates,\n\u25cf expected long-term return on plan assets,\n\u25cf compensation increases,\n\u25cf retirement rates,\n\u25cf mortality rates, and\n\u25cf expected contributions.\nAssumptions are set each year-end. These assumptions are not changed during the year unless there is a significant plan event. Actual results that differ from the assumptions affect future expenses and obligations.\nThe key pension and OPEB amounts follow:\nPension and OPEB net (benefit) cost\n$\n(13)\n$\n$\nLong-term expected return on pension and OPEB plan assets (as a percent)\n6.2\n5.0\n5.9\nLong-term expected return on pension and OPEB plan assets\nActual return (loss) on pension and OPEB plan assets\n(395)\n(3,565)\n3,616\nPension assets, net of pension liabilities\n2,076\n2,690\n2,665\nOPEB liabilities, net of OPEB assets\n1,001\n1,205\n3,175\nThe reduction in the 2023 pension and OPEB net (benefit) cost was due to increased expected long-term return rates on plan assets and increased discount rates.\nThe effect of hypothetical changes to selected assumptions on our major U.S. retirement benefit plans would be as follows:\nOctober 29, 2023\nIncrease\nIncrease\nPercentage\n(Decrease)\n(Decrease)\nAssumptions\nChange\nPBO/APBO*\nExpense\nPension\nDiscount rate**\n+/-.5\n$\n(414)/456\n$\n3/(3)\nExpected return on assets\n+/-.5\n(63)/63\nOPEB\nDiscount rate**\n+/-.5\n(120)/130\n(4)/5\nExpected return on assets\n+/-.5\n(10)/10\nHealth care cost\ntrend rate**\n+/-1.0\n231/(202)\n39/(34)\n*\nProjected benefit obligation (PBO) for pension plans and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (APBO) for OPEB plans.\n**\nPretax impact on service cost, interest cost, and amortization of gains or losses.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:\n\u25cf finance product category,\n\u25cf market,\n\u25cf geography,\n\u25cf credit risk, and\n\u25cf remaining balance.\nWe utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:\n\u25cf Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools. These models are used for more than 90 percent of retail customer receivables. Historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels are used to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses.\n\u25cf Weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) models are used for smaller and less complex retail customer receivable pools.\n\u25cf Historical loss rate models are used on wholesale receivables, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk.\nThe model output is adjusted for forecasted economic conditions, which may include the following economic indicators:\n\u25cf commodity prices,\n\u25cf industry equipment sales,\n\u25cf unemployment rates, and\n\u25cf housing starts.\nManagement reviews each models output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance decreased in 2023 due to the disposition of the receivable portfolio in Russia (see Note 11). Excluding the portfolio in Russia, the allowance increased slightly as higher portfolio balances and higher expected losses on turf and construction customer accounts. The allowance increased in 2022 due to higher reserves related to the economic uncertainty in Russia.\nWhile we believe our allowance is sufficient to provide for losses over the life of our existing receivable portfolio, different assumptions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses, specifically:\n\u25cf For the wholesale receivable portfolio: Changes in economic conditions have historically had limited impact on credit losses.\n\u25cf Within the retail customer receivable portfolio: Credit loss estimates are dependent on a number of factors, including historical portfolio performance, current economic conditions, current delinquency levels, and estimated recoveries on defaulted accounts.\nHolding all other factors constant, a 10 percent increase in the transition matrix models forecasted defaults and a simultaneous 10 percent decrease in recovery rates would have resulted in a $53 increase to the allowance for credit losses at October 29, 2023.\nOperating Lease Residual Values\nEquipment on operating leases is depreciated to the estimated residual value over the lease term. The residual values are based on several factors, including:\n\u25cf lease term,\n\u25cf expected hours of usage,\n\u25cf historical wholesale sales prices,\n\u25cf return experience,\n\u25cf intended equipment use,\n\u25cf market dynamics and trends, and\n\u25cf dealer residual value guarantees.\nWe review residual value estimates during the lease term. Depreciation is adjusted over the remaining lease term if residual estimates are revised. Impairments are recorded when events or circumstances necessitate.\nAt the end of the majority of leases, the equipment is disposed in the following sequence:\n\u25cf The lessee has the option to purchase the equipment for the contractual residual value.\n\u25cf The dealer has the option to purchase the equipment.\n\u25cf The equipment is sold to a third party at the equipments fair value. In this situation, we may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the residual value and the sale price.\nOperating Lease Residual Values\nHypothetically, if (a) future market values for this equipment were to decrease 10 percent from our present estimates and (b) all the equipment on operating leases were returned to us for remarketing at the end of the lease term, the total unfavorable impact after consideration of dealer residual value guarantees would be approximately $90. This amount would be recognized as higher depreciation expense over the remaining term of the operating leases, or potentially as an impairment.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to federal, state, and foreign income taxes. These tax laws can be complex. Significant judgment and interpretation is required to implement them. Changes in tax laws could materially affect our consolidated financial statements. We record our tax positions in the following categories:\n\u25cf current taxes,\n\u25cf deferred taxes, and\n\u25cf uncertain tax positions.\nDeferred income taxes represent temporary differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities.\nThis will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future. Loss carryforwards and tax credits are significant components of deferred tax asset balances. These assets are reviewed regularly for the following:\n\u25cf the likelihood of recoverability from future taxable income,\n\u25cf reversal of deferred tax liabilities, and\n\u25cf tax planning strategies.\nValuation allowances are established when we determine that the deferred tax benefit may not be realized. The recoverability analysis requires significant judgment and relies on estimates. The valuation allowance as of October 29, 2023 was $1.6 billion. Changes in foreign income tax laws, income for certain jurisdictions, or our tax structure could impact the valuation allowance balance.\nSome tax positions contain significant uncertainties. These positions may be challenged or disallowed by taxing authorities. If it is likely the position will be disallowed, no tax benefit is recorded. If it is likely the position will be sustained, a tax benefit is recognized. The ultimate resolution could take many years. This may result in a payment that is significantly different from the original estimate.\nSee Note 8 for further information on income taxes.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained herein, including in the section entitled Overview relating to future events, expectations, and trends constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and involve factors that are subject to change, assumptions, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties could affect all lines of our operations generally while others could more heavily affect a particular line of business.\nForward-looking statements are based on currently available information and current assumptions, expectations, and projections about future events and should not be relied upon. Except as required by law, we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise our forward-looking statements. Many factors, risks, and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. Among these factors are risks related to:\n\u25cf changes in U.S., foreign and international laws, regulations, and policies relating to trade, spending, taxing, banking, monetary, environmental (including climate change and engine emission), and farming policies;\n\u25cf political, economic, and social instability of the geographies in which we operate, including the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine and between Israel and Hamas;\n\u25cf adverse macroeconomic conditions, including unemployment, inflation, rising interest rates, changes in consumer practices due to slower economic growth or possible recession, and regional or global liquidity constraints;\n\u25cf growth and sustainability of non-food uses for crops (including ethanol and biodiesel production);\n\u25cf the ability to execute business strategies, including our Smart Industrial Operating Model, Leap Ambitions, and mergers and acquisitions;\n\u25cf the ability to understand and meet customers changing expectations and demand for our products and solutions;\n\u25cf accurately forecasting customer demand for products and services and adequately managing inventory;\n\u25cf our ability to integrate new technology, including automation and machine learning, and deliver precision technology and solutions to customers;\n\u25cf changes to governmental communications channels (radio frequency technology);\n\u25cf our ability to adapt in highly competitive markets;\n\u25cf dealer practices and their ability to manage distribution of our products and support and service precision technology solutions;\n\u25cf changes in climate patterns, unfavorable weather events, and natural disasters;\n\u25cf governmental and other actions designed to address climate change in connection with a transition to a lower-carbon economy;\n\u25cf higher interest rates and currency fluctuations which could adversely affect the U.S. dollar, customer confidence, access to capital, and demand for our products and solutions;\n\u25cf stress in the banking sector may have adverse impacts on vendors or customers as well as on our ability to access cash deposits;\n\u25cf availability and price of raw materials, components, and whole goods;\n\u25cf delays or disruptions in our supply chain;\n\u25cf labor relations and contracts, including work stoppages and other disruptions;\n\u25cf the ability to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf security breaches, cybersecurity attacks, technology failures, and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure and products;\n\u25cf loss of or challenges to intellectual property rights;\n\u25cf compliance with evolving U.S. and foreign laws, including economic sanctions, data privacy, and environmental laws and regulations;\n\u25cf legislation introduced or enacted that could affect our business model and intellectual property, such as so-called right to repair or right to modify legislation;\n\u25cf investigations, claims, lawsuits, or other legal proceedings;\n\u25cf events that damage our reputation or brand;\n\u25cf world grain stocks, available farm acres, soil conditions, harvest yields, prices for commodities and livestock, input costs, and availability of transport for crops; and\n\u25cf housing starts and supply, real estate and housing prices, levels of public and non-residential construction, and infrastructure investment.\nFurther information concerning our businesses, including factors that could materially affect our financial results, is included in our filings with the SEC (including, but not limited to, the factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described herein because we do not currently perceive them to be material.\nSUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA\nThe supplemental consolidating data presented on the subsequent pages is presented for informational purposes. The equipment operations represents the enterprise without financial services. The equipment operations includes production and precision agriculture operations, small agriculture and turf operations, construction and forestry operations, and other corporate assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses not reflected within financial services. Transactions between the equipment operations and financial services have been eliminated to arrive at the consolidated financial statements.\nThe equipment operations and financial services participate in different industries. The equipment operations generate earnings and cash flows by manufacturing and selling equipment, service parts, and technology solutions to dealers and retail customers. Financial services finances sales and leases by dealers of new and used equipment that is largely manufactured by us. Those earnings and cash flows generally are the difference between the finance income received from customer payments less interest expense, and depreciation on equipment subject to an operating lease. The two businesses are capitalized differently and have separate performance metrics. The supplemental consolidating data is also used by management due to these differences.\nINCOME STATEMENTS\nFor the Years Ended October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021\nUnaudited\nEQUIPMENT\nFINANCIAL\nOPERATIONS\nSERVICES\nELIMINATIONS\nCONSOLIDATED\nNet Sales and Revenues\nNet sales\n$\n55,565\n$\n47,917\n$\n39,737\n$\n55,565\n$\n47,917\n$\n39,737\nFinance and interest income\n$\n5,055\n$\n3,583\n$\n3,442\n$\n(1,008)\n$\n(431)\n$\n(279)\n4,683\n3,365\n3,296\nOther income\n1,261\n(354)\n(468)\n(302)\n1,003\n1,295\n2, 3\nTotal\n57,059\n49,391\n40,811\n5,554\n4,085\n3,794\n(1,362)\n(899)\n(581)\n61,251\n52,577\n44,024\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of sales\n37,739\n35,341\n29,119\n(24)\n(3)\n(3)\n37,715\n35,338\n29,116\nResearch and development expenses\n2,177\n1,912\n1,587\n2,177\n1,912\n1,587\nSelling, administrative and general expenses\n3,611\n3,137\n2,887\n(10)\n(9)\n(8)\n4,595\n3,863\n3,383\nInterest expense\n2,362\n(320)\n(127)\n(62)\n2,453\n1,062\nInterest compensation to Financial Services\n(687)\n(299)\n(217)\nOther operating expenses\n1,396\n1,386\n1,453\n(321)\n(461)\n(291)\n1,292\n1,275\n1,343\n5, 6\nTotal\n44,842\n41,429\n34,359\n4,752\n2,920\n2,644\n(1,362)\n(899)\n(581)\n48,232\n43,450\n36,422\nIncome before Income Taxes\n12,217\n7,962\n6,452\n1,165\n1,150\n13,019\n9,127\n7,602\nProvision for income taxes\n2,685\n1,718\n1,386\n2,871\n2,007\n1,658\nIncome after Income Taxes\n9,532\n6,244\n5,066\n10,148\n7,120\n5,944\nEquity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\nNet Income\n9,536\n6,250\n5,084\n10,155\n7,130\n5,965\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(11)\n(1)\n(11)\n(1)\nNet Income Attributable to Deere & Company\n$\n9,547\n$\n6,251\n$\n5,082\n$\n$\n$\n$\n10,166\n$\n7,131\n$\n5,963\n1 Elimination of intercompany interest income and expense.\n2 Elimination of equipment operations margin from inventory transferred to equipment on operating leases (see Note 6).\n3 Elimination of financial services income related to intercompany guarantees of investments in certain international markets and intercompany service revenues.\n4 Elimination of intercompany service fees.\n5 Elimination of financial services lease depreciation expense related to inventory transferred to equipment on operating leases.\n6 Elimination of equipment operations expense related to intercompany guarantees of investments in certain international markets and intercompany service expenses.\nSUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATING DATA (continued)\nCONDENSED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022\nUnaudited\nEQUIPMENT\nFINANCIAL\nOPERATIONS\nSERVICES\nELIMINATIONS\nCONSOLIDATED\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,720\n$\n3,767\n$\n1,738\n$\n1,007\n$\n7,458\n$\n4,774\nMarketable securities\nReceivables from Financial Services\n4,516\n6,569\n$\n(4,516)\n$\n(6,569)\nTrade accounts and notes receivable -

As a result, we enter into derivative transactions to manage this exposure and not for speculative purposes.\nFrom time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our interest rate exposure. We also have foreign currency exposures at some of our foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. We have entered into derivative agreements related to the management of these foreign currency transaction risks.\nInterest Rate Risk\nResults of Operations - Central bank policy rates increased in 2022 and 2023. Rising interest rates have historically impacted our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the financing receivable and equipment on operating lease portfolios. As a result, our financial services operations experienced spread compression in 2023. If interest rates continue to rise, we expect to continue experiencing spread compression in 2024.\nFair Value Measurement - Quarterly, we use a combination of cash flow models to assess the sensitivity of our financial instruments with interest rate exposure to changes in market interest rates. The models calculate the effect of adjusting interest rates as follows:\n\u25cf cash flows for financing receivables are discounted at the current prevailing rate for each receivable portfolio,\n\u25cf cash flows for marketable securities are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads,\n\u25cf cash flows for unsecured borrowings are discounted at the applicable benchmark yield curve plus market credit spreads for similarly rated borrowers,\n\u25cf cash flows for securitized borrowings are discounted at the swap yield curve plus a market credit spread for similarly rated borrowers, and\n\u25cf cash flows for interest rate swaps are projected and discounted using forward rates from the swap yield curve at the repricing dates.\nThe net impact in these financial instruments fair values which would be caused by decreasing or increasing the interest rates by 10 percent from the market rates at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 would have been approximately $10 and $50, respectively.\nReference Rate Reform - We transitioned our financing, funding, and hedging portfolios from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) to alternative reference rates in 2023. In 2024, we will transition certain portfolios from the Canadian Dollar Offered Rate (CDOR) to an alternative reference rate. These transition activities did not / are not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nForeign Currency Risk\nIn the equipment operations, the practice is to hedge significant currency exposures. Worldwide foreign currency exposures are reviewed quarterly. Based on the anticipated and committed foreign currency cash inflows, outflows, and hedging policy for the next twelve months, we estimate that a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies through 2024 would increase the 2024 expected net cash inflows by approximately $25. At October 29, 2023, a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar under similar assumptions and calculations indicated a potential $125 decrease on the 2023 net cash inflows. The estimated impacts by currency follow:\nAustralian dollar\n$\n(75)\n$\n(100)\nBrazilian real\n(150)\nBritish pound\n(50)\n(25)\nCanadian dollar\n(25)\nEuro\nJapanese yen\nMexican peso\nPolish Zloty\n(25)\n(25)\nAll other\n(25)\nTotal increase (decrease)\n$\n$\n(125)\nIn the financial services operations, our policy is to manage foreign currency risk through hedging strategies if the currency of the borrowings does not match the currency of the receivable portfolio. As a result, a hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to all other foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the financial services cash flows.\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME\nFor the Years Ended October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021\nNet Sales and Revenues\nNet sales\n$\n55,565\n$\n47,917\n$\n39,737\nFinance and interest income\n4,683\n3,365\n3,296\nOther income\n1,003\n1,295\nTotal\n61,251\n52,577\n44,024\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of sales\n37,715\n35,338\n29,116\nResearch and development expenses\n2,177\n1,912\n1,587\nSelling, administrative and general expenses\n4,595\n3,863\n3,383\nInterest expense\n2,453\n1,062\nOther operating expenses\n1,292\n1,275\n1,343\nTotal\n48,232\n43,450\n36,422\nIncome of Consolidated Group before Income Taxes\n13,019\n9,127\n7,602\nProvision for income taxes\n2,871\n2,007\n1,658\nIncome of Consolidated Group\n10,148\n7,120\n5,944\nEquity in income of unconsolidated affiliates\nNet Income\n10,155\n7,130\n5,965\nLess: Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(11)\n(1)\nNet Income Attributable to Deere & Company\n$\n10,166\n$\n7,131\n$\n5,963\nPer Share Data\nBasic\n$\n34.80\n$\n23.42\n$\n19.14\nDiluted\n34.63\n23.28\n18.99\nDividends declared\n5.05\n4.36\n3.61\nDividends paid\n4.83\n4.28\n3.32\nAverage Shares Outstanding (In millions of shares)\nBasic\n292.2\n304.5\n311.6\nDiluted\n293.6\n306.3\n314.0\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nDEERE & COMPANY\nSTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the Years Ended October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021\nNet Income\n$\n10,155\n$\n7,130\n$\n5,965\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Income Taxes\nRetirement benefits adjustment\n(456)\n2,884\nCumulative translation adjustment\n(1,116)\nUnrealized gain (loss) on derivatives\n(29)\nUnrealized loss on debt securities\n(16)\n(109)\n(18)\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Income Taxes\n(58)\n(517)\n3,000\nComprehensive Income of Consolidated Group\n10,097\n6,613\n8,965\nLess: Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(2)\n(16)\nComprehensive Income Attributable to Deere & Company\n$\n10,099\n$\n6,629\n$\n8,963\nThe notes to consolidated financial statements are an integral part of this statement.\nDEERE & COMPANY\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022\nASSETS\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n7,458\n$\n4,774\nMarketable securities\nTrade accounts and notes receivable -

ORGANIZATION AND CONSOLIDATION\nReferences to Deere & Company, John Deere, Deere, we, us, or our include our consolidated subsidiaries. We manage our business through the following operating segments: production and precision agriculture (PPA), small agriculture and turf (SAT), construction and forestry (CF), and financial services (FS). References to equipment operations include PPA, SAT, and CF, while references to agriculture and turf include both PPA and SAT.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements represent the consolidation of all companies in which Deere & Company has a controlling interest. Certain variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated since we are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We consolidate certain VIEs related to retail note securitizations (see Note 12).\nWe record our investment in each unconsolidated affiliated company (20 to 50 percent ownership) at cost, plus or minus our share of the profit or loss after acquisition, and further reduced for any dividends (see Note 16). Other investments (less than 20 percent ownership) are recorded at cost.\nFiscal Year\nWe use a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday in the reporting period, which generally occurs near the end of October. An additional week is included in the fourth fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign our fiscal quarters with the calendar. The fiscal year ends for 2023, 2022, and 2021 were October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021, respectively. Fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 contained 52 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, or months refer to our fiscal years and the associated periods in those fiscal years.\nPresentation of Amounts\nAll amounts are presented in millions of dollars, unless otherwise specified.\nArgentina\nWe have equipment operations and financial services operations in Argentina. The U.S. dollar has historically been the functional currency for our Argentina operations, as our business is indexed to the U.S. dollar due to the highly inflationary conditions. The Argentine government has certain capital and currency controls that restrict our ability to access U.S. dollars in Argentina and remit earnings from our Argentine operations. As of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, our net investment in Argentina was $766 and $742, respectively. Net sales and revenues from our Argentine operations represented approximately 1 percent of consolidated net sales and revenues for 2023 and 2022. We have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible. These mechanisms are short-term in nature, leaving us exposed to long-term currency fluctuations. As of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, the gross peso exposure was $30 and $133, respectively, while the net peso exposure (after considering the impact of short-term hedges) was $5 and $53, respectively. Argentine peso-denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at each balance sheet date using the official currency exchange rate.\n2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nThe following are significant accounting policies in addition to those included in other notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates in Financial Statements\nCertain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions in determining the amounts reflected in the financial statements and related disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nGeneral\nSales of equipment and service parts are recognized when we transfer control of the good to the independent customer, which generally occurs upon shipment. In most situations, the independent customer is a dealer, which subsequently sells the equipment and service parts purchased from us to a retail customer, who can finance the equipment with the financial services segment or another source of financing. In some\nsituations, we sell directly to a retail customer. The term customer includes both dealers and retail customers to whom we make direct sales.\nInterest-Free Periods and Past-Due Interest\nWe charge dealers interest on outstanding balances from the earlier of when goods are sold to a retail customer by the dealer or the expiration of the interest-free period granted at the time of the sale to the dealer. Interest-free periods are determined based on the type of equipment sold and the time of year of the sale. These periods range from one to twelve months for most equipment. Interest-free periods may not be extended. Interest charged may not be forgiven, and past due interest rates are charged at higher rates. If the interest-free or below market interest rate period exceeds one year, we adjust the expected sales revenue for the effects of the time value of money using a current market interest rate. The revenue related to the financing component is recognized in Finance and interest income using the interest method. We do not adjust the sales price to account for a financing component if the expected interest-free or below market period is one year or less.\nRight of Return\nGenerally, no right of return exists on sales of equipment. Dealers cannot cancel purchases after we recognize a sale and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to a retail customer. Service parts and certain attachment returns are estimable and accrued at the time a sale is recognized. The estimated returns are based on historical return rates, current dealer inventory levels, and current economic conditions. The estimated returns are recorded in Other assets for the inventory value of estimated returns, adjusted for restocking fees. The estimated dealer refund liability, adjusted for restocking fees, is recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nRemanufacturing\nWe remanufacture used engines and components (cores) that are sold to dealers and retail customers for maintenance and repair parts. Revenue for remanufactured components is recognized using the same criteria as other parts sales. When a remanufactured part is sold, we collect a deposit that is repaid if the customer returns a core that meets certain specifications within a defined time period. The deposit received from the customer is recognized as a liability in Accounts payable and accrued expenses and the used component that is expected to be returned is recognized in Other assets. When a customer returns a core, the deposit is repaid, the liability reversed, and the returned core is recorded in inventory to be remanufactured and sold to another customer. If a core is not returned within the required time, the deposit is recognized as revenue in Net sales, and the cost of the core is recorded as an expense in Cost of sales.\nBundled Technology\nCertain equipment is sold with precision guidance, telematics, and other information gathering and analyzing capabilities. These technology solutions require hardware, software, and may include an obligation to provide services for a period of time. These solutions are mostly bundled with the sale of the equipment but\ncan also be purchased or renewed separately. The revenue related to the hardware and embedded software is recognized at the time of the equipment sale and recorded in Net sales. The revenue for the future services and usage-based software is deferred and recognized over the service period. The deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability in Accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nFinancing Revenue and Origination Costs\nFinancing revenue and deferred costs on the origination of financing receivables are recorded over the lives of the related receivables using the interest method. Deferred costs are recognized as a reduction to Finance and interest income. Income and deferred costs on the origination of operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the scheduled lease terms in Finance and interest income.\nSales Incentives\nWe offer sales incentive programs to promote the sale of our products from the dealer to the retail customer. At the time of the sale to a dealer, we record an estimated cost for the sales incentive programs as a reduction to the sales price. The estimated cost is based on historical data, announced and expected incentive programs, field inventory levels, and forecasted sales volumes. The final cost of these programs is determined at the end of the measurement period for volume-based incentives or when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in Net sales.\nProduct Warranties\nFor equipment and service parts sales, we provide a standard warranty. At the time a sale is recognized, the estimated future warranty costs are recorded. The warranty liability is estimated based on historical warranty claims rate experience and the estimated amount of equipment still under warranty. The historical claims rate is primarily determined by a review of five-year claims costs while also taking into consideration current quality developments. The amount of equipment still under warranty is estimated based on dealer inventories and retail sales.\nWe also offer extended warranty arrangements for purchase at the customers option. The premiums for extended warranties are recognized in Other income primarily in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred over the contract period. The unamortized extended warranty premiums (deferred revenue) are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 18).\nSales and Transaction Taxes\nWe collect and remit taxes for revenue producing transactions as necessary based on various tax laws. These taxes include sales, use, value-added, and some excise taxes. We elected to exclude these taxes from the determination of the sales price. These taxes are not included in revenues.\nContract Costs\nIncremental costs of obtaining an equipment revenue contract are recognized as an expense when incurred since the amortization period would be one year or less.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are charged to Selling, administrative and general expenses as incurred. Advertising costs were $244 in 2023, $227 in 2022, and $212 in 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nProperty and equipment, capitalized software, and other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. These assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Equipment on operating leases is depreciated over the terms of the leases using the straight-line method. Property and equipment expenditures for new and revised products, increased capacity, and the replacement or major renewal of significant items are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor renewals are charged to expense as incurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe consider investments with purchased maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nReceivables and Allowances\nAll financing and trade receivables are reported on the balance sheet at outstanding principal and accrued interest, adjusted for:\n\u25cf write-offs,\n\u25cf allowance for credit losses, and\n\u25cf unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated financing receivables.\nThe allowance is a reduction to the receivable balances, and the provision is recorded in Selling, administrative and general expenses. The allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:\n\u25cf finance product category,\n\u25cf market,\n\u25cf geography,\n\u25cf credit risk, and\n\u25cf remaining balance.\nWe utilize the following loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses:\n\u25cf Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools. These models are used for more than 90 percent of retail customer receivables. Historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels are used to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses.\n\u25cf Weighted average remaining maturity (WARM) models are used for smaller and less complex retail customer receivable pools.\n\u25cf Historical loss rate models are used on wholesale receivables, with consideration of current economic conditions and dealer financial risk.\nThe model output is adjusted for forecasted economic conditions, which may include the following economic indicators:\n\u25cf commodity prices,\n\u25cf industry equipment sales,\n\u25cf unemployment rates, and\n\u25cf housing starts.\nManagement reviews each models output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary (see Note 11).\nLong-Lived Assets, Goodwill, and Other Intangible Asset Impairment\nWe evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets (including equipment on operating leases, property and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets) when events or circumstances warrant such a review. Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are tested for impairment annually at the end of the third quarter of each fiscal year, and more often if events or circumstances may have caused the fair value to fall below the carrying value. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is considered impaired, the long-lived asset is written down to its fair value (see Notes 4 and 25).\nGoodwill is allocated and reviewed for impairment by reporting unit. Goodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. To test for goodwill impairment, the carrying value of each reporting unit is compared with its fair value. If the carrying value of the goodwill is considered impaired, the impairment is measured as the reporting units carrying value minus the fair value.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nIt is our policy to use derivative transactions only to manage exposures from the normal course of business. We do not execute derivative transactions for the purpose of creating speculative positions or trading. Our financial services operations have interest rate and foreign currency exposure between (a) the receivable or lease portfolio and (b) how those portfolios are funded. We also have foreign currency exposures at some of our foreign and domestic operations related to buying, selling, and financing in currencies other than the functional currencies. In addition, we have interest rate and foreign currency exposure at certain equipment operations units for sales incentive programs.\nAll derivatives are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash collateral received or paid is not offset against the derivative fair values on the balance sheets. The cash flows from the derivative contracts are recorded in operating activities in the statements of consolidated cash flows. Each derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, fair value hedge, or remains undesignated.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are recorded as follows:\n\u25cf Cash flow hedges: Recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and reclassified to the income statement when the effects of the item being hedged are recognized in the income statement. These amounts offset the effects of interest rate changes on the related borrowings in interest expense.\n\u25cf Fair value hedges: Recorded in interest expense, and the gains or losses are offset by the fair value gains or losses on the hedged items (fixed-rate borrowings), which are also recorded in interest expense.\n\u25cf Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges are recognized as they occur in the income statement.\nAll designated hedges are formally documented as to the relationship with the hedged item as well as the risk-management strategy. Both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the hedging instrument is assessed for its effectiveness. If and when a derivative is determined not to be highly effective as a hedge, the underlying hedged transaction is no longer likely to occur, the hedge designation is removed, or the derivative is terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued (see Note 26).\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe functional currencies for most of our foreign operations are their respective local currencies. The assets and liabilities of these operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates at the end of the period. The revenues and expenses are translated at weighted-average rates for the period. The gains or losses from these translations are recorded in OCI.\nForeign currency gains or losses and foreign exchange components of derivative contracts are included in net income, with trade flow activity recorded in Cost of sales, sales incentive activity recorded in Net sales, and all other activity recorded in Other operating expenses. The pretax net loss for foreign exchange in 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $159, $175, and $134, respectively.\nNew Accounting Standards\nWe closely monitor all Accounting Standard Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and other authoritative guidance. We adopted the following standards in 2023, none of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements:\nNew Accounting Standards Adopted\nNo. 2021-10 - Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\nNo. 2021-05 - Leases (Topic 842): Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments\nNo. 2021-04 - Issuer's Accounting for Certain Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity Classified Written Call Options\nWe will adopt the following standards in future periods, none of which are expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Standards to be Adopted\nNo. 2022-04 - Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nNo. 2022-02 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures\nNo. 2022-01 - Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method\nNo. 2021-08 - Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n3. ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nDuring the presented periods, we completed acquisitions to support our Leap Ambitions, which focus on advancing our capabilities in technology.\nAcquisitions\n2023 Acquisitions\nIn 2023, we acquired SparkAI Inc. (Spark AI) and Smart Apply, Inc. (Smart Apply) to accelerate the integration of smart technology innovation in our products. The combined cost of these acquisitions was $82, net of cash acquired of $2. Spark AI was assigned to the PPA segment, while Smart Apply was assigned to the SAT segment. Most of the purchase price for these acquisitions was allocated to goodwill.\n2022 Acquisitions\nKreisel\nIn February 2022, we acquired majority ownership in Kreisel Electric Inc. (Kreisel), a pioneer in the development of immersion-cooled battery technology. The Austrian company manufactures high-density, high-durability electric battery modules and packs for high-performance and off-highway applications and has created a battery-buffered, high-powered charging infrastructure platform.\nThe transaction includes a call option to purchase the remaining ownership interest in Kreisel in 2027. The minority interest holders also have a put option that would require us to purchase the holders ownership interests in 2027. The put and call options cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interest. Due to the redemption features, the minority interest is classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe total cash purchase price was $276, consisting of $253 for the acquired equity interests, $21 to reduce the option price, and customary working capital adjustments, net of cash acquired. The fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of the acquired entity, which are based on information as of the acquisition date and available at October 30, 2022, follows:\nFebruary 2022\nTrade accounts and notes receivable\n$\nOther receivables\nInventories\nProperty and equipment\nGoodwill\nOther intangible assets\nOther assets\nTotal assets\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\nDeferred income taxes\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n$\nThe identifiable intangible assets were related to technology, trade name, and customer relationships with a weighted average amortization period of 12 years. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. Kreisel is allocated amongst the PPA, SAT, and CF segments.\nExcavator Factories\nIn March 2022, we acquired full ownership of three former Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories and began new license and supply agreements with Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (Hitachi). The two companies also ended their joint venture manufacturing and marketing agreements. The former joint venture factories continue to manufacture Deere-branded construction excavators and forestry equipment. Through a new supply agreement with Hitachi, Deere continues to offer a full portfolio of excavators. Deeres marketing arrangement for Hitachi-branded construction excavators and mining equipment in the Americas ended with Hitachi assuming distribution and support of these products. John Deere dealers may continue to support their existing field population of Hitachi-branded excavators.\nWith the completion of this acquisition, we now have complete control over the excavator design, product, and feature updates, making it possible to more rapidly respond to customer requirements and integrate excavators with other construction products in the John Deere product portfolio. We can leverage technology developed for other product lines and production systems across the enterprise and extend those advanced solutions to Deere-designed excavators, strengthening the entire product portfolio. The total invested capital is as follows:\nMarch 2022\nCash consideration for factories\n$\nCash consideration for license agreement\nDeferred consideration\nTotal purchase price consideration\nLess: Cash obtained\n(187)\nLess: Settlement of intercompany balances\n(113)\nNet purchase price consideration\nFair value of previously held equity investment\nTotal invested capital\n$\nThe total purchase price consideration includes deferred consideration that will be paid as we purchase Deere-branded excavators, components, and service parts from Hitachi under the new supply agreement with a duration that ranges from 5 to 30 years. The deferred consideration represents the price increases under the new supply arrangement. Excluding inflation adjustments, the price increases for products to be acquired by us from Hitachi are as much as 27 percent higher than the prior supply arrangement. We financed the acquisition and associated transaction expenses from cash on hand. The fair value of the previously held equity investment created a non-cash gain of $326 (pretax and after-tax), which was recorded in Other income and included in the CF segments operating profit.\nPrior to the acquisition, we purchased Deere- and Hitachi-branded excavators, components, and parts from the Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories for sale to John Deere dealers. These purchases were included in Cost of sales, while the sales to John Deere dealers were included in Net sales. Cost of sales also included profit-sharing payments to Hitachi in accordance with the previous marketing agreements. Following the acquisition, Net sales only\nincludes the sale of Deere-branded excavators to John Deere dealers, while Cost of sales reflects market pricing to purchase and manufacture excavators, as well as the related components and service parts.\nThe fair values assigned to the assets and liabilities of the acquired factories, which are based on information as of the acquisition date and available at October 30, 2022, follow:\nMarch 2022\nOther receivables\n$\nInventories\nProperty and equipment\nGoodwill\nOther intangible assets\nDeferred income taxes\nOther assets\nTotal assets\n$\n1,153\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\nLong-term borrowings\nTotal liabilities\n$\nThe identifiable intangible assets were related to technology with a 10-year amortization period. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. The excavator factories are reported in the CF segment.\nOther Acquisitions\nIn 2022, we acquired AgriSync Inc. (AgriSync), a technology service provider; an 80 percent stake in both SureFire Ag Systems, Inc. and SureFire Electronics, LLC (renamed after acquisition and collectively referred to as SurePoint), which design and manufacture liquid fertilizer application and spray tendering systems; an equity method investment in GUSS Automation LLC (GUSS Automation), a pioneer in semi-autonomous orchard and vineyard sprayers; LGT, LLC (Light), which specializes in depth sensing and camera-based perception for autonomous vehicles; and an equity method investment in InnerPlant, Inc. (InnerPlant), an early-stage biotech company. The combined cost of these acquisitions was $134, net of cash acquired of $3. The asset and liability fair values at the respective acquisition dates follow:\nOctober 2022\nTrade accounts and notes receivable\n$\nInventories\nProperty and equipment\nGoodwill\nOther intangible assets\nOther assets\nTotal assets\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\nDeferred income taxes\nTotal liabilities\n$\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest\n$\nThe identifiable intangible assets were related to trade name, technology, and customer relationships with a weighted average amortization period of 7 years. AgriSync was allocated amongst the PPA, SAT, and CF segments, while SurePoint, Light, and InnerPlant were allocated to the PPA segment. GUSS Automation was assigned to the SAT segment.\n2021 Acquisitions\nBear Flag\nIn August 2021, we acquired Bear Flag Robotics, Inc. (Bear Flag) to further accelerate Deeres development and delivery of advanced technology. Bear Flags technology is complementary to other Deere technology efforts and enables autonomous tractor operations. The total cash purchase price before final adjustments, net of cash acquired of $4, was $225, with an additional $25 to be recognized as compensation expense over the four-year post-acquisition service period. In addition to the cash purchase price, $19 of liabilities were assumed. The asset and liability fair values at the acquisition date follow:\nAugust 2021\nProperty and equipment\n$\nGoodwill\nOther intangible assets\nTotal assets\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\nDeferred income taxes\nTotal liabilities\n$\nThe identified intangible was related to technology with a seven-year amortization period. The goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nFor the acquisitions, the goodwill was the result of future cash flows and related fair value exceeding the fair value of the identified assets and liabilities. The results of these operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements, and the pro forma results of operations as if these acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of the current or comparative fiscal year would not differ significantly from the reported results.\nDispositions\nIn October 2023, we sold our roadbuilding business in Russia. At the time of the sale, total assets were $32, consisting primarily of restricted cash, total liabilities were $1, and the cumulative translation loss was $11. Total proceeds from the sale include $16 of cash and $8 of deferred consideration. A pretax and after-tax loss of $18 was recorded in Other operating expenses in the CF segment.\nIn March 2023, we sold our financial services business in Russia (registered in Russia as a leasing company) to Insight Investment Group. The total proceeds, net of restricted cash sold, were $36. The operations were included in the financial services operating segment through the date of sale. At the disposal date, the total assets were $31, consisting primarily of financing receivables, the total liabilities were $5, and the cumulative translation loss was $10. In the first quarter of 2023, we reversed the allowance for\ncredit losses and recorded a valuation allowance on the assets held for sale in Selling, administrative and general expenses. We did not incur additional gains or losses upon disposition.\n4. SPECIAL ITEMS\nWe were impacted by the following infrequent items. These items should not be considered recurring in nature.\n2023 Special Items\nSale of Russian Roadbuilding Business\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we sold our Russian roadbuilding business, recognizing a loss of $18 (pretax and after-tax). The loss was recorded in Other operating expenses in the construction and forestry operations.\nBrazil Tax Ruling\nIn the third quarter of 2023, the Brazil Superior Court of Justice published a favorable tax ruling regarding taxability of local incentives, which allowed us to record a $243 reduction in the provision for income taxes and $47 of interest income.\nFinancial Services Financing Incentives Correction\nIn the second quarter of 2023, we corrected the accounting treatment for financing incentives offered to John Deere dealers, which impacted the timing of expense recognition and the presentation of incentive costs in the consolidated financial statements. The cumulative effect of this correction, $173 pretax ($135 after-tax), was recorded in the second quarter of 2023. Prior period results for Deere & Company were not restated, as the adjustment was considered immaterial to our financial statements.\n2022 Special Items\nUAW Collective Bargaining Agreement\nIn November 2021, employees represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) approved a new collective bargaining agreement. The agreement, which has a term of six years, covers the wages, hours, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment for our UAW-represented employees at 14 U.S. facilities. The labor agreement included a lump sum ratification bonus payment of $8,500 per eligible employee, totaling $90 million, and an immediate wage increase of 10 percent plus further wage increases over the term of the contract. The lump sum payment was expensed in the first quarter of 2022.\nImpact of Events in Russia / Ukraine\nWe suspended shipments of machines and service parts to Russia due to the events in Russia / Ukraine. The suspension of shipments reduced the forecasted revenue for the region, which made it probable future cash flows would not cover the carrying value of certain assets. As a result, an impairment was recorded for most long-lived assets in Russia, and our U.S. senior management decided to initiate a voluntary employee-separation program. We also recorded a reserve on inventory, and increased our allowance for credit losses, reflecting economic uncertainty in Russia.\nThe financial services operations received an intercompany benefit from the equipment operations, which guarantees the financial\nservices investments in certain international markets, including Russia.\nThe Russian government imposed certain restrictions on companies abilities to repatriate or remit cash from their Russian-based operations to locations outside of Russia. Cash in excess of what was required to fund operations in Russia was reclassified as restricted. A summary of the reserves, impairments, and voluntary-separation costs recorded in 2022 follows. See Note 25 for fair value measurement information.\nPPA\nSAT\nCF\nFS\nTotal\nInventory reserve - Cost of sales\n$\n$\n$\n$\nFixed asset impairment - Cost of sales\nIntangible asset impairment - Cost of sales\nAllowance for credit losses - Financing receivables - SA&G expenses\n$\nVoluntary-separation program:\n- Cost of sales\n- SA&G expenses\nIntercompany agreement\n(153)\nTotal Russia/Ukraine events pretax expense\n$\n$\n$\n$\nNet tax impact\n(40)\nTotal Russia/Ukraine events after-tax expense\n$\nGain on Previously Held Equity Investment\nIn March 2022, we acquired full ownership of three former Deere-Hitachi joint venture factories and began new license and supply agreements with Hitachi. The fair value of the previous equity investment resulted in a non-cash gain of $326 (pretax and after-tax; see Note 3).\nSummary of 2023 and 2022 Special Items\nThe following table summarizes the operating profit impact of the special items recorded in 2023 and 2022:\nPPA\nSAT\nCF\nFS\nTotal\n2023 Expense\nRussian roadbuilding sale - Other operating expense\n$\n$\nFinancing incentive - SA&G expense\n$\nTotal expense\n2022 Expense (benefit)\nGain on remeasurement of equity investment - Other income (Note 3)\n(326)\n(326)\nTotal Russia/Ukraine events pretax expense\n$\n$\nUAW ratification bonus - Cost of sales\nTotal expense (benefit)\n(188)\nYear over year change\n$\n(186)\n$\n(20)\n$\n$\n$\n5.

These relate to extended warranty premiums, advance payments for future equipment sales, and subscription and service revenue related to precision guidance, telematic services, and other information enabled solutions. These advanced customer payments are presented as deferred revenue, a contract liability, in Accounts payable and accrued expenses. The deferred revenue received, but not recognized in revenue was $1,697 and $1,423 at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, respectively. The contract liability is reduced as the revenue is recognized. Revenue recognized from deferred revenue that was recorded as a contract liability at the beginning of the fiscal year was $547 in 2023, $609 in 2022, and $485 in 2021.\nThe total amount of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original duration greater than one year and the estimated revenue to be recognized by fiscal year at October 29, 2023 follows:\nYear\nNet Sales and Revenues\n$\nLater years\nTotal\n$\n1,491\nAs permitted, we elected only to disclose remaining performance obligations with an original contract duration greater than one year.

SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nAll cash flows from receivables related to sales are included in operating activities. This includes all changes in trade accounts and notes receivables, as well as some financing receivables. Financing receivables that are related to loans on equipment sold by independent dealers are included in investing activities.\nOur short-term borrowings mature or may require payment within three months or less. During 2023, we issued $4.5 billion and retired $3.2 billion of retail note securitization borrowings, which are presented in Net proceeds (payments) in short-term borrowings (original maturities three months or less).\nRestricted cash, recorded in Other assets, relates to securitization of financing receivables (see Note 12) and cash held in Russia.\nSupplemental cash flow information follows:\nCash paid for interest\n$\n2,227\n$\n1,101\n$\n1,041\nCash paid for income taxes\n3,578\n1,940\n2,075\nInventory transferred to equipment on operating leases\nAccounts payable related to purchases of property and equipment\n7. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe have several funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans cover U.S. employees and certain foreign employees. The measurement date of our plans is October 31. The funded status as of October 31, 2023 of the significant plans follows:\nFunded\nEnrollment\nStatus\nStatus\nPensions\nU.S. salaried qualified\n$\n1,511\nClosed\nU.S. hourly qualified\n1,042\nOpen\nOther\n(477)\nVaries\nTotal\n$\n2,076\nOPEB\nU.S. salaried\n$\n(1,086)\nClosed\nU.S. hourly\nClosed\nOther\n(93)\nVaries\nTotal\n$\n(1,001)\nThe components of net periodic pension and OPEB cost excluding the service component are included in the line item Other operating expenses.\nThe components of net periodic pension (benefit) cost and the related assumptions consisted of the following:\nPensions\nService cost\n$\n$\n$\nInterest cost\nExpected return on plan assets\n(878)\n(726)\n(799)\nAmortization of actuarial (gain) loss\n(13)\nAmortization of prior service cost\nSettlements/curtailment\nNet (benefit) cost\n$\n(37)\n$\n$\nWeighted-average assumptions\nDiscount rates - service cost\n5.2%\n3.0%\n2.5%\nDiscount rates - interest cost\n5.1%\n2.6%\n2.1%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.8%\n3.7%\n3.7%\nExpected long-term rates of return\n6.3%\n5.1%\n6.0%\nInterest crediting rate - U.S. cash balance plans\n4.3%\n2.1%\n1.7%\nIn November 2021, employees represented by the UAW approved a new collective bargaining agreement. We remeasured the U.S. hourly pension plan, which increased the 2022 pension expense by nearly $80 with $35 negatively impacting operating profit.\nThe 2024 net periodic pension benefit is expected to increase by $130 due to an increase in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets (estimated to be 7.0 percent) and the Canadian pension settlement charge recognized in 2023, described below.\nThe components of net periodic OPEB cost and the assumptions related to the cost consisted of the following:\nOPEB\nService cost\n$\n$\n$\nInterest cost\nExpected return on plan assets\n(117)\n(110)\n(77)\nAmortization of actuarial (gain) loss\n(59)\n(18)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n(3)\n(4)\n(4)\nNet cost\n$\n$\n$\nWeighted-average assumptions\nDiscount rates - service cost\n6.1%\n3.6%\n3.4%\nDiscount rates - interest cost\n5.4%\n2.3%\n2.1%\nExpected long-term rates of return\n5.7%\n4.4%\n5.4%\nThe benefit plan obligations, funded status, and the assumptions related to the obligations at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follow:\nPensions\nOPEB\nChange in benefit obligations\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n(10,529)\n$\n(14,525)\n$\n(3,341)\n$\n(4,930)\nService cost\n(246)\n(349)\n(27)\n(45)\nInterest cost\n(533)\n(330)\n(176)\n(99)\nActuarial gain\n4,122\n1,492\nPrior service cost\n(505)\n(12)\nBenefits paid\nHealth care subsidies\n(27)\n(33)\nSettlement\nForeign exchange and other\n(74)\n(3)\nEnd of year balance\n(9,928)\n(10,529)\n(3,029)\n(3,341)\nChange in plan assets (fair value)\nBeginning of year balance\n13,219\n17,190\n2,136\n1,755\nActual loss on plan assets\n(387)\n(3,070)\n(8)\n(495)\nEmployer contribution\n1,155\nBenefits paid\n(838)\n(757)\n(260)\n(282)\nSettlement\n(112)\nForeign exchange and other\n(229)\nEnd of year balance\n12,004\n13,219\n2,028\n2,136\nFunded status\n$\n2,076\n$\n2,690\n$\n(1,001)\n$\n(1,205)\nWeighted-average assumptions\nDiscount rates\n5.9%\n5.4%\n6.0%\n5.6%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.8%\n3.8%\nInterest crediting rate - U.S. cash balance plans\n4.9%\n4.4%\nThe actuarial gain for pension for 2023 was due to an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for OPEB for 2023 was due to changes to health care assumptions. The actuarial gains for pension and OPEB for 2022 were due to an increase in discount rates. The pension prior service cost for 2022 was due to the new UAW collective bargaining agreement.\nDuring 2023, we irrevocably transferred to an insurance company $112 of a Canadian pension plans defined benefit obligations and related plan assets. The transaction resulted in no changes to the benefits to be received by the retired participants. We recognized a one-time, non-cash, pretax pension settlement charge of $36 related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the pension and OPEB obligations for all periods presented were based on hypothetical AA yield curves represented by a series of annualized individual discount rates. These discount rates represent the rates at which our benefit obligations could effectively be settled at the October 31 measurement dates.\nThe mortality assumptions for the 2023 and 2022 U.S. benefit plan obligations used the most recent tables and scales issued by the Society of Actuaries at that time. The 2023 and 2022 mortality assumptions included an adjustment to the scale related to COVID for some plans.\nThe weighted-average annual rates of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits (the health care cost trend rates) for medical and prescription drug claims for pre- and post-65 age groups used to determine the October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 accumulated postretirement benefit obligations were as follows:\nInitial year\n18.7% (2023 to 2024)\n0.0% (2022 to 2023)\nSecond year\n8.8% (2024 to 2025)\n12.6% (2023 to 2024)\nUltimate\n4.7% (2032 to 2033)\n4.7% (2032 to 2033)\nAn increase in Medicare Advantage premiums and prescription drug trends impacted the weighted-average annual rates of increase for the initial year in 2023. A decrease in Medicare Advantage premiums impacted the weighted-average annual rates of increase for the initial year in 2022.\nInformation related to pension plans benefit obligations at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follows:\nTotal accumulated benefit obligations for all plans\n$\n9,453\n$\n10,068\nPlans with accumulated benefit obligation exceeding fair value of plan assets:\nAccumulated benefit obligations\n1,147\n1,116\nFair value of plan assets\nPlans with projected benefit obligation exceeding fair value of plan assets:\nProjected benefit obligations\n1,261\n1,225\nFair value of plan assets\nThe pension and OPEB amounts recognized in the balance sheet at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 consisted of the following:\nPensions\nOPEB\nNoncurrent asset\n$\n2,608\n$\n3,223\n$\n$\nLess: Current liability\nLess: Noncurrent liability\n1,360\n1,673\nTotal\n$\n2,076\n$\n2,690\n$\n(1,001)\n$\n(1,205)\nThe retirement benefits and other liabilities recognized in the balance sheet at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 consisted of the following:\nDeferred compensation - current\n$\n$\nDeferred compensation and other - noncurrent\nPensions and OPEB - current\nPensions and OPEB - noncurrent\n1,833\n2,164\nTotal\n$\n2,140\n$\n2,457\nThe amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income - pretax at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 consisted of the following:\nPensions\nOPEB\nNet actuarial (gain) loss\n$\n1,660\n$\n$\n(921)\n$\n(820)\nPrior service (credit) cost\n(1)\n(4)\nTotal\n$\n2,066\n$\n1,372\n$\n(922)\n$\n(824)\nActuarial gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). To the extent unamortized gains and losses exceed 10 percent of the higher of the market-related value of assets or the benefit obligation, the excess is amortized as a component of net periodic (benefit) cost over the remaining service period of the active participants. For plans in which all or almost all of the plans participants are inactive, the amortization period is the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants.\nContributions\nWe make any required contributions to the plan assets under applicable regulations and voluntary contributions after evaluating our liquidity position and ability to make tax-deductible contributions. Total contributions to the plans were $228 in 2023 and $1,240 in 2022, which included both required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments. 2022 OPEB contributions included a voluntary contribution of $1,000 to a U.S. plan.\nWe expect to contribute approximately $85 to our pension plans and approximately $140 to our OPEB plans in 2024. The contributions include required and voluntary contributions and direct benefit payments from company funds. We have no significant required contributions to U.S. pension plan assets in 2024 under applicable funding regulations.\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nThe expected future benefit payments at October 29, 2023 were as follows:\nPensions\nOPEB*\n$\n$\n2029 to 2033\n3,564\n1,251\n* Net of prescription drug group benefit subsidy under Medicare Part D.\nPlan Asset Information\nThe fair values of the pension plan assets at October 29, 2023 follow:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nCash and short-term investments\n$\n$\n$\nEquity:\nU.S. equity securities\nInternational equity securities and funds\nFixed Income:\nGovernment and agency securities\n1,017\nCorporate debt securities\n4,389\n4,389\nMortgage-backed securities\nPrivate equity\n$\nOther investments\nDerivative contracts - assets\nDerivative interest rate contracts - liabilities\n(309)\n(215)\n(94)\nReceivables, prepaids, and payables\n(137)\n(137)\nSecurities lending collateral\nSecurities lending liability\n(615)\n(615)\nSecurities sold short\n(73)\n(69)\n(4)\nTotal of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 assets\n6,347\n$\n1,382\n$\n4,947\n$\nInvestments at net asset value:\nShort-term investments\nU.S. equity funds\nInternational equity funds\nFixed income funds\n1,418\nReal estate funds\nHedge funds\nPrivate equity\n1,306\nVenture capital\n1,341\nOther investments\nTotal net assets\n$\n12,004\nThe fair values of the OPEB health care assets at October 29, 2023 follow:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nCash and short-term investments\n$\n$\nFixed Income:\nGovernment and agency securities\n$\nCorporate debt securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nOther\nSecurities lending collateral\nSecurities lending liability\n(122)\n(122)\nTotal of Level 1 and Level 2 assets\n1,325\n$\n$\nInvestments at net asset value:\nFixed income funds\nReal estate funds\nHedge funds\nPrivate equity\nVenture capital\nOther investments\nTotal net assets\n$\n2,028\nThe fair values of the pension plan assets at October 30, 2022 follow:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nCash and short-term investments\n$\n$\n$\nEquity:\nU.S. equity securities\nInternational equity securities and funds\nFixed Income:\nGovernment and agency securities\n1,296\n1,053\nCorporate debt securities\n4,587\n4,587\nMortgage-backed securities\nOther investments\nDerivative contracts - assets\nDerivative contracts - liabilities\n(209)\n(106)\n(103)\nReceivables, prepaids, and payables\n(207)\n(207)\nSecurities lending collateral\nSecurities lending liability\n(684)\n(684)\nSecurities sold short\n(64)\n(58)\n(6)\nTotal of Level 1 and Level 2 assets\n6,602\n$\n1,535\n$\n5,067\nInvestments at net asset value:\nShort-term investments\nU.S. equity funds\nInternational equity funds\nFixed income funds\n1,736\nReal estate funds\nHedge funds\nPrivate equity\n1,322\nVenture capital\n1,553\nOther investments\nTotal net assets\n$\n13,219\nThe fair values of the OPEB health care assets at October 30, 2022 follow:\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nCash and short-term investments\n$\n$\nFixed Income:\nGovernment and agency securities\n$\nCorporate debt securities\nMortgage-backed securities\nOther\n(4)\n(7)\nSecurities lending collateral\nSecurities lending liability\n(98)\n(98)\nTotal of Level 1 and Level 2 assets\n1,303\n$\n$\nInvestments at net asset value:\nU.S. equity funds\nInternational equity funds\nFixed income funds\nReal estate funds\nHedge funds\nPrivate equity\nVenture capital\nOther investments\nTotal net assets\n$\n2,136\nInvestments at net asset value in the preceding tables are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. Fair value measurement levels in the preceding tables are defined in Note 25.\nFair values are determined as follows:\nCash and Short-Term Investments - The investments include (1) cash accounts that are valued based on the account value, which approximates fair value; (2) investments that are valued at quoted prices in the active markets in which the investment trades or using a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data; and (3) investment funds that are valued based on a constant fund net asset value, which is based on quoted prices in the active market in which the investment fund trades, or the funds net asset value using the net asset value per share practical expedient (NAV), which is based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nEquity Securities and Funds - The values are determined by quoted prices in the active market in which the equity investment trades, or the funds NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nFixed Income Securities and Funds and Other Funds - The securities are valued using either a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds, or they are valued using the quoted prices in the active market in which the fixed income investment trades. Fixed income and other funds are valued using the funds NAV, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nReal Estate, Venture Capital, Private Equity, and Hedge Funds - The investments that are structured as limited partnerships, excluding the private equity investments classified as Level 3, are valued at estimated fair value based on their proportionate share of the limited partnerships fair value that is determined by the respective general partner. These investments are valued using the funds NAV, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Valuations may be lagged up to six months. The NAV is adjusted for cash flows (additional investments or contributions, and distributions) and any known substantive valuation changes through year end. The private equity investments classified as Level 3 are valued based on the current market pricing of the assets related to an expected secondary sale. The investments were transferred into Level 3 as of October 29, 2023.\nDerivative Instruments - The derivatives are valued using either an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates, or a market approach (quoted prices in the active market in which the derivative instrument trades).\nThe investment objective for the pension and health care plan assets is to fulfill the projected obligations to the beneficiaries over a long period of time, while meeting our fiduciary responsibilities. The asset allocation policy is the most important decision in managing the assets, and it is reviewed regularly. The asset allocation policy considers our long-term asset class risk/return expectations for each plan since the obligations are long-term in nature. The target asset allocations as of October 29, 2023 are as follows:\nPension\nHealth Care\nAssets\nAssets\nEquity\n5%\n9%\nDebt\n68%\n83%\nReal estate\n4%\n2%\nOther investments\n23%\n6%\nThe assets are diversified and are managed by professional investment firms as well as by investment professionals who are company employees. As a result of our diversified investment policy, there were no significant concentrations of risk.\nA market related value of plan assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets. The market related value recognizes changes in the fair value of pension plan assets systematically over a five-year period. The market related value of the health care plan assets equals fair value.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects managements expectations of long-term average rates of return on funds invested to provide for benefits included in the projected benefit obligations. The expected return is based on the outlook for inflation and for returns in multiple asset classes, while also considering historical returns, asset allocation, and investment strategy. Our approach has emphasized the long-term nature of the return estimate such that the return assumption is not changed significantly unless there are fundamental changes in capital markets that affect our expectations for returns over an\nextended period of time (i.e., 10 to 20 years). The average annual return of our U.S. pension fund was approximately 6.8 percent during the past ten years and approximately 7.8 percent during the past 20 years.\nWe have created a Voluntary Employees Beneficiary Association trust (VEBA) for the funding of hourly postretirement health care benefits. The future expected asset returns for the VEBA is lower than the expected return on the other pension and health care plan assets due to investment in a higher proportion of liquid securities. These assets are in addition to the other postretirement health care plan assets that have been funded under Section 401(h) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code and maintained in a separate account in the John Deere Pension Trust.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe have defined contribution plans related to employee investment and savings plans primarily in the U.S. Our contributions and costs under these plans were $288 in 2023, $263 in 2022, and $207 in 2021. The contribution rate varies based on employee participation in the plans.\n8. INCOME TAXES\nWe are subject to income taxes in a number of jurisdictions. We determine our income tax provision using the asset and liability method. The provision for income taxes by taxing jurisdiction and by significant component consisted of the following:\nCurrent:\nU.S.:\nFederal\n$\n1,803\n$\n$\nState\nForeign\n1,472\n1,423\n1,017\nTotal current\n3,661\n2,073\n2,099\nDeferred:\nU.S.:\nFederal\n(485)\n(303)\nState\n(65)\n(45)\nForeign\n(240)\n(119)\n(93)\nTotal deferred\n(790)\n(66)\n(441)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n2,871\n$\n2,007\n$\n1,658\nBased upon the location of our operations, the consolidated income before income taxes in the U.S. in 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $7.8 billion, $5.0 billion, and $4.1 billion, respectively, and in foreign countries was $5.2 billion, $4.1 billion, and $3.5 billion, respectively. Certain foreign operations are branches or partnerships of Deere & Company and are subject to U.S. as well as foreign income tax regulations. The pretax income by location and the preceding analysis of the income tax provision by taxing jurisdiction are not directly related.\nA comparison of the statutory and effective income tax provision and reasons for related differences follow:\nU.S. federal income tax provision at the U.S. statutory rate (21 percent)\n$\n2,734\n$\n1,917\n$\n1,597\nState and local taxes, net of federal effect\nOther impacts of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017\n(58)\n(29)\n(85)\nRate differential on foreign subsidiaries\nResearch and business tax credits\n(107)\n(65)\n(48)\nExcess tax benefits on equity compensation\n(49)\n(55)\n(79)\nValuation allowances\nOther - net\n(66)\n(194)\n(12)\nProvision for income taxes\n$\n2,871\n$\n2,007\n$\n1,658\nAt October 29, 2023, undistributed profits of subsidiaries outside the U.S. of approximately $5.1 billion are considered indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the amount of a foreign withholding tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.\nDeferred income taxes arise because there are certain items that are treated differently for financial accounting than for income tax reporting purposes. An analysis of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follows:\nDeferred\nDeferred\nDeferred\nDeferred\nTax\nTax\nTax\nTax\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAccrual for employee benefits\n$\n$\nAccrual for sales allowances\nAllowance for credit losses\nAmortization of R&D expenditures\nDeferred compensation\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n$\n$\nLessee lease transactions\nLessor lease transactions\nOPEB - net\nPension - net\nShare-based compensation\nTax loss and tax credit carryforwards\n1,518\n1,405\nTax over book depreciation\nUnearned revenue\nOther items\nLess: valuation allowances\n(1,612)\n(1,545)\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities\n$\n3,002\n$\n1,708\n$\n1,834\n$\n1,505\nDeere & Company files a consolidated federal income tax return in the U.S., which includes the wholly-owned financial services subsidiaries. These subsidiaries account for income taxes as if they filed separate income tax returns, with a modification for realizability of certain tax benefits.\nAt October 29, 2023, tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $1,518 were available with $1,031 expiring from 2024 through 2043 and $487 with an indefinite carryforward period.\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021 follows:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n$\n$\nIncreases to tax positions taken during the current year\nIncreases to tax positions taken during prior years\nDecreases to tax positions taken during the current year\n(3)\nDecreases to tax positions taken during prior years\n(209)\n(18)\n(23)\nDecreases due to lapse of statute of limitations\n(10)\n(7)\n(12)\nOther\n(4)\n(3)\nForeign exchange\n(24)\nEnd of year balance\n$\n$\n$\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 that would impact the effective tax rate if the tax benefits were recognized was $329 and $303, respectively. The remaining liability was related to tax positions for which there are offsetting tax receivables, or the uncertainty was only related to timing. We expect that any reasonably possible change in the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months would not be significant.\nWe file our tax returns according to the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, which includes the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed the examination of our federal income tax returns for periods prior to 2015. The federal income tax returns for years 2015 to 2020 are currently under examination. Various state and foreign income tax returns also remain subject to examination by taxing authorities.\n9. OTHER INCOME AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES\nThe major components of other income and other operating expenses consisted of the following:\nOther income\nRevenues from services\n$\n$\n$\nExtended warranty premiums earned\nTrademark licensing income\nOperating lease disposition gains\nGain on previously held equity investment\nInvestment income\nOther\nTotal\n$\n1,003\n$\n1,295\n$\nOther operating expenses\nDepreciation of equipment on operating leases\n$\n$\n$\nExtended warranty claims\nCost of services\nPension and OPEB benefit, excluding the service cost component\n(286)\n(218)\n(183)\nForeign exchange loss\nOther\nTotal\n$\n1,292\n$\n1,275\n$\n1,343\n10. MARKETABLE SECURITIES\nMost marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale. Realized gains or losses are based on specific identification.\nThe amortized cost and fair value of marketable securities at the end of 2023 and 2022 follow:\nGross\nGross\nAmortized\nUnrealized\nUnrealized\nFair\nCost\nGains\nLosses\nValue\nInternational equity securities\n$\nInternational mutual funds securities\nU.S. equity fund\nU.S. fixed income fund\nTotal equity securities\nCorporate debt securities\n$\n$\nInternational debt securities\nMortgage-backed securities*\nMunicipal debt securities\nU.S. government debt securities\nTotal debt securities\n$\n$\nMarketable securities\n$\nInternational equity securities\n$\nU.S. equity fund\nTotal equity securities\nCorporate debt securities\n$\n$\nInternational debt securities\nMortgage-backed securities*\nMunicipal debt securities\nU.S. government debt securities\nTotal debt securities\n$\n$\nMarketable securities\n$\n* Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.\nThe purchases, maturities, and sale proceeds for marketable securities during 2023, 2022, and 2021 follow:\nPurchases\n$\n$\n$\nMaturities and sale proceeds\nEquity Securities\nProceeds of equity securities sold during 2023, 2022, and 2021 were not material.

Mortgage-backed securities contain prepayment provisions and are not categorized by contractual maturity.\nThe following debt security items were not material in 2023, 2022, and 2021:\n\u25cf realized gains,\n\u25cf realized losses, and\n\u25cf unrealized losses that have been continuous for over twelve months.\nUnrealized losses at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 were not recognized in income due to the ability and intent to hold to maturity. There were no significant impairment write-downs in the periods reported.\n11. RECEIVABLES\nTrade Accounts and Notes Receivable\nTrade accounts and notes receivable arise from sales of goods to independent dealers. See Note 2 for our revenue recognition policy. We evaluate and assess dealers credit worthiness on an ongoing basis. Receivables are secured with collateral or other credit enhancements. Trade accounts and notes receivable at the end of 2023 and 2022 follow:\nTrade accounts and notes receivable:\nProduction & precision ag\n$\n2,642\n$\n2,397\nSmall ag & turf\n2,344\n2,065\nConstruction & forestry\n2,753\n1,948\nTrade accounts and notes receivable - net\n$\n7,739\n$\n6,410\nThese receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets. Credit losses have been historically low. There is not a disproportionate concentration of credit risk with any single dealer. On a geographic basis, 53 percent of our trade accounts and notes receivable are located in the U.S. and Canada at October 29, 2023.\nAt October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 trade and notes receivables balances outstanding greater than 12 months were $107 and $49, respectively.\nThe allowance for credit losses on trade accounts and notes receivable at October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021, as well as the related activity, follow:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n$\n$\nASU No. 2016-13\n(2)\nProvision\nWrite-offs\n(8)\n(5)\n(7)\nTranslation adjustments\n(1)\nEnd of year balance\n$\n$\n$\nThe equipment operations sell a significant portion of their trade receivables to financial services. Compensation is provided to financial services at market interest rates.\nFinancing Receivables - Overall\nFinancing receivables originate under the following circumstances:\n\u25cf Retail customers purchase (or lease) equipment from a dealer and finance the equipment through John Deere Financial.\n\u25cf We sell the equipment to a dealer under trade terms. Trade terms end, and the dealer finances the equipment on a wholesale receivable. Shown as wholesale notes in Financing Receivables related to the Sale of Equipment.\n\u25cf A dealer finances the purchase of used equipment through John Deere Financial.\n\u25cf We sell (or lease) the equipment directly to a retail customer with terms typically greater than 12 months. Shown as retail notes or sales-type leases in the Financing Receivables related to the Sale of Equipment.\n\u25cf The customer utilizes a revolving credit product to finance parts, service, or input costs.\nFinancing receivables at the end of 2023 and 2022 follow:\nUnrestricted/Securitized\nUnrestricted/Securitized\nRetail notes:\nAgriculture and turf\n$\n26,955\n$\n6,052\n$\n23,830\n$\n4,868\nConstruction and forestry\n4,623\n1,442\n4,396\n1,179\nTotal\n31,578\n7,494\n28,226\n6,047\nWholesale notes\n6,947\n3,285\nRevolving charge accounts\n4,789\n4,316\nFinancing leases (direct\nand sales-type)\n2,906\n2,832\nTotal financing receivables\n46,220\n7,494\n38,659\n6,047\nLess:\nUnearned finance income:\nRetail notes\n1,906\n1,358\nWholesale notes\nRevolving charge accounts\nFinancing leases\nTotal\n2,372\n1,716\nAllowance for credit losses\nFinancing receivables - net\n$\n43,673\n$\n7,335\n$\n36,634\n$\n5,936\nAssets managed by financial services continue to be evaluated by market, rather than by operating segment. Financing receivables have significant concentrations of credit risk in the agriculture and turf and construction and forestry markets. On a geographic basis,\n84 percent of our financing receivables were located in the U.S. and Canada at October 29, 2023. There is no disproportionate concentration of credit risk with any single customer or dealer. We retain as collateral security in the equipment associated with most financing receivables. Theft and physical damage insurance are required for this equipment.\nFinancing Receivables - Related to the Sale of Equipment\nFinancing receivables related to the sale of equipment are presented in the operating section of the cash flow statement. The balances at the end of 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nRetail notes*:\nAgriculture and turf\n$\n1,084\n$\n1,392\nConstruction and forestry\nTotal\n1,404\n1,696\nWholesale notes\n6,947\n3,285\nDirect financing and sales-type leases*\nTotal\n8,845\n5,780\nLess:\nUnearned finance income:\nRetail notes\nWholesale notes\nDirect financing and sales-type leases\nTotal\nFinancing receivables related to our sales of equipment\n$\n8,623\n$\n5,568\n* These balances arise from sales and direct financing leases of equipment by company-owned dealers or through direct sales.\nFinancing Receivables - Contractual Installment Payments\nFinancing receivable installments, including unearned finance income, at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 were scheduled as follows:\nUnrestricted/Securitized\nUnrestricted/Securitized\nDue in months:\n0 - 12\n$\n22,176\n$\n2,820\n$\n17,032\n$\n2,226\n13 - 24\n8,646\n2,089\n7,975\n1,667\n25 - 36\n6,692\n1,509\n5,987\n1,209\n37 - 48\n4,844\n4,297\n49 - 60\n2,920\n2,559\nThereafter\nTotal\n$\n46,220\n$\n7,494\n$\n38,659\n$\n6,047\nFinancing Receivables - Credit Quality Analysis\nWe monitor the credit quality of financing receivables based on delinquency status, defined as follows:\n\u25cf Past due balances represent any payments 30 days or more past the due date.\n\u25cf Non-performing financing receivables represent receivables for which we have stopped accruing finance income. This generally occurs when receivables are 90 days delinquent.\n\u25cf Write-offs generally occur when receivables are 120 days delinquent. In these situations, the estimated uncollectible amount is written off to the allowance for credit losses. Any expected recovery is presented as non-performing.\nFinance income for non-performing receivables is recognized on a cash basis. Accrual of finance income is resumed when the receivable becomes contractually current and collections are reasonably assured.\nThe credit quality analysis of retail notes, financing leases, and revolving charge accounts (collectively, retail customer receivables) by year of origination was as follows:\nOctober 29, 2023\nRetail customer receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n15,191\n$\n8,430\n$\n5,120\n$\n2,334\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n2,927\n1,961\n1,084\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal retail customer receivables\n$\n18,340\n$\n10,705\n$\n6,421\n$\n2,791\nOctober 29, 2023\nPrior Years\nRevolving Charge Accounts\nTotal\nRetail customer receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n$\n4,526\n$\n36,734\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n6,557\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal retail customer receivables\n$\n$\n$\n4,698\n$\n44,283\nOctober 30, 2022\nRetail customer receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n13,500\n$\n7,984\n$\n4,091\n$\n1,875\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n2,964\n1,974\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal retail customer receivables\n$\n16,650\n$\n10,239\n$\n5,091\n$\n2,252\nOctober 30, 2022\nPrior Years\nRevolving Charge Accounts\nTotal\nRetail customer receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n$\n4,111\n$\n32,546\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n6,265\n30-59 days past due\n60-89 days past due\n90+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal retail customer receivables\n$\n$\n$\n4,255\n$\n39,622\nThe credit quality analysis of wholesale receivables by year of origination was as follows:\nOctober 29, 2023\nWholesale receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n$\n$\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal wholesale receivables\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOctober 29, 2023\nPrior Years\nRevolving\nTotal\nWholesale receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n$\n5,175\n$\n6,085\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal wholesale receivables\n$\n$\n$\n5,887\n$\n6,922\nOctober 30, 2022\nWholesale receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n$\n$\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal wholesale receivables\n$\n$\n$\n$\nOctober 30, 2022\nPrior Years\nRevolving\nTotal\nWholesale receivables:\nAgriculture and turf\nCurrent\n$\n$\n2,371\n$\n2,855\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nConstruction and forestry\nCurrent\n30+ days past due\nNon-performing\nTotal wholesale receivables\n$\n$\n2,748\n$\n3,273\nFinancing Receivables - Allowance for Credit Losses\nAn analysis of the allowance for credit losses and investment in financing receivables follows:\nRetail Notes\nRevolving\n& Financing\nCharge\nWholesale\nLeases\nAccounts\nReceivables\nTotal\nAllowance:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n$\n$\n$\nProvision\nProvision transferred to held for sale\n(142)\n(142)\nProvision (credit)\n(45)\n(23)\nWrite-offs\n(84)\n(45)\n(129)\nRecoveries\nTranslation adjustments\n(19)\n(19)\nEnd of year balance*\n$\n$\n$\n$\nFinancing receivables:\nEnd of year balance\n$\n39,585\n$\n4,698\n$\n6,922\n$\n51,205\nAllowance:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n$\n$\n$\nProvision (credit)\n(2)\n(3)\nWrite-offs\n(61)\n(27)\n(88)\nRecoveries\nTranslation adjustments\nEnd of year balance*\n$\n$\n$\n$\nFinancing receivables:\nEnd of year balance\n$\n35,367\n$\n4,255\n$\n3,273\n$\n42,895\nAllowance:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n$\n$\n$\nASU No. 2016-13\n(13)\nProvision (credit)\n(17)\n(1)\n(18)\nWrite-offs\n(60)\n(28)\n(88)\nRecoveries\nTranslation adjustments\nEnd of year balance*\n$\n$\n$\n$\nFinancing receivables:\nEnd of year balance\n$\n32,233\n$\n3,825\n$\n2,566\n$\n38,624\n* Individual allowances were not significant.\nWe monitor the economy as part of the allowance setting process, including potential impacts of inflation and rising interest rates. Adjustments to the allowance are incorporated, as necessary.\nDuring 2023, we determined that the financial services business in Russia met the held for sale criteria. The financing receivables in Russia were reclassified to Other assets and the associated allowance for credit losses was reversed. These operations were sold in the second quarter of 2023 (see Note 3). Excluding the portfolio in Russia, the allowance increased in 2023, primarily driven by growth in the retail notes and financing lease portfolios\nand higher expected losses on turf and construction customer accounts.\nIn 2022, the allowance for credit losses on retail notes and financing lease receivables increased due to higher reserves related to the events in Russia / Ukraine and higher portfolio balances. These increases were partially offset by continued positive agricultural market conditions. The revolving portfolio experienced low write-offs and solid recoveries.\nFinancing receivable analysis metrics follow:\nPercent of the overall financing receivable portfolio:\nPast-due amounts\n1.02\n1.07\nNon-performing\n.92\n.83\nAllowance for credit losses\n.38\n.76\nDeposits held as credit enhancements\n$\n$\nThe allowance for credit losses as a percent of the overall financing receivable portfolio follow:\nDeere & Company\n.38\n.76\n.43\nClosest comparators*\n.90\n.93\n1.15\n* Peer companies from the 6153 and 6159 standard industrial classification (SIC) codes.\nFinancing Receivables - Troubled Debt Restructurings\nInfrequently, a customer experiences financial difficulties, and we grant a concession. These concessions may include:\n\u25cf a reduction of the stated interest rate,\n\u25cf an extension of the maturity dates,\n\u25cf a reduction of the amount of the debt, or\n\u25cf a reduction of accrued interest.\nA troubled debt restructuring is a significant modification of the receivable. The following table quantifies troubled debt restructurings:\nNumber of receivable contracts\nPre-modification balance\n$\n$\n$\nPost modification balance\nTroubled debt restructurings for the presented periods related to retail notes. In 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no significant troubled debt restructurings that subsequently defaulted and were written off. At October 29, 2023, we had no commitments to lend to customers whose accounts were modified in troubled debt restructurings.\nOther Receivables\nOther receivables at the end of 2023 and 2022 consisted of:\nTaxes receivable\n$\n1,626\n$\n1,450\nCollateral on derivatives\nReceivables from unconsolidated affiliates\nOther\nOther receivables\n$\n2,623\n$\n2,492\n12. SECURITIZATION OF FINANCING RECEIVABLES\nOur funding strategy includes receivable securitizations, which allows us to receive cash for financing receivables immediately. While these securitization programs are administered in various forms, they are accomplished in the following basic steps:\n1. We transfer financing receivables into a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity (SPE).\n2. The SPE issues debt to investors. The debt is secured by the financing receivables.\n3. Investors are paid back based on cash receipts from the financing receivables.\nAs part of step 1, these receivables are legally isolated from the claims of our general creditors. This ensures cash receipts from the financing receivables are accessible to pay back securitization program investors. The structure of these transactions does not meet the accounting criteria for a sale of receivables. As a result, they are accounted for as a secured borrowing. The receivables and borrowings remain on our balance sheet and are separately reported as Financing receivables securitized - net and Short-term securitization borrowings, respectively.\nWe offer securitization programs to institutional investors and other financial institutions through public issuances or privately through a revolving credit agreement. At October 29, 2023, the revolving agreement had a financing limit of up to $1,500. At October 29, 2023, $1,281 of securitization borrowings were outstanding under the revolving agreement. In November 2023, the agreement was renewed for one year with a capacity of $2,000.\nRestricted cash held by the SPE serves as a credit enhancement. It would be used to satisfy receivable payment deficiencies, if any. The cash restriction is removed either after all secured borrowing payments are made or proportionally as the secured receivables are collected and the borrowing obligations are reduced.\nThe components of the securitization programs were as follows at the end of 2023 and 2022:\nFinancing receivables securitized (retail notes)\n$\n7,357\n$\n5,952\nAllowance for credit losses\n(22)\n(16)\nOther assets (primarily restricted cash)\nTotal restricted securitized assets\n$\n7,487\n$\n6,091\nShort-term securitization borrowings\n$\n6,995\n$\n5,711\nAccrued interest on borrowings\nTotal liabilities related to restricted securitized assets\n$\n7,008\n$\n5,717\nThe weighted-average interest rates on short-term securitization borrowings at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 were 4.7 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.\nAlthough these securitization borrowings are classified as short-term since payment is required if the financing receivables are liquidated early, the payment schedule for these borrowings at October 29, 2023 based on the expected liquidation of the retail notes is as follows: 2024 - $3,278, 2025 - $2,076, 2026 - $1,187, 2027 - $417, 2028 - $44, and later years - $4.\n13.

For the purpose of computing the unused credit lines, commercial paper and short-term bank borrowings were considered to constitute utilization. The credit agreements governing these lines of credit require us to maintain certain covenants. All of these credit agreement requirements have been met during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements.\n18.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nA standard warranty is provided as assurance that the equipment will function as intended. The standard warranty period varies by product and region. At the time a sale is recognized, we record an estimate of future warranty costs based on historical claims rate experience and estimated population under warranty. The warranty reconciliation follows:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n1,427\n$\n1,312\nWarranty claims paid\n(1,181)\n(951)\nNew product warranty accruals\n1,347\n1,090\nForeign exchange\n(24)\nEnd of year balance\n$\n1,610\n$\n1,427\nThe costs for extended warranty programs are recognized as incurred. See Note 9 for extended warranty claim costs.\nIn certain international markets, we provide guarantees to banks for the retail financing of John Deere equipment. At the end of\n2023, the notional value of these guarantees was $239. We may repossess the equipment collateralizing the receivables. At October 29, 2023, the accrued losses under these guarantees were not material.\nWe also had other miscellaneous contingent liabilities totaling approximately $105 at October 29, 2023. The accrued liability for these contingencies was not material.\nAt October 29, 2023, we had commitments of approximately $634 for the construction and acquisition of property and equipment.\nWe have commitments to extend credit to customers. The commitments are in the form of lines of credit and other pre-approved credit arrangements. We have the right to cancel or amend the terms of these commitments at any time. These commitments are not expected to be fully drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts likely do not represent a future cash requirement. The commitments to extend credit at October 29, 2023 were:\n\u25cf $9.3 billion to John Deere dealers, and\n\u25cf $32.4 billion to retail customers.\nWe are subject to various unresolved legal actions. The accrued losses on these matters are not material. We believe the reasonably possible range of losses for these unresolved legal actions would not have a material effect on our financial statements. The most prevalent legal claims relate to:\n\u25cf product liability (including asbestos-related matters),\n\u25cf retail credit,\n\u25cf employment,\n\u25cf patent,\n\u25cf trademark, and\n\u25cf antitrust matters.\n21. CAPITAL STOCK\nOur stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol DE. At the end of 2023, there were 17,158 holders of record of our common stock.\nThe number of common shares we are authorized to issue is 1.2 billion. The common shares issued at October 29, 2023, October 30, 2022, and October 31, 2021 were 536.4 million. 281.6 million common shares were outstanding at October 29, 2023, with the remainder held in treasury stock.\nThe number of authorized preferred shares is 9 million. No preferred shares have been issued.\nIn December 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $18.0 billion of common stock. At the end of fiscal year 2023, this repurchase program had $13.0 billion (35.9 million shares based on our fiscal year end closing NYSE common stock price of $361.15 per share) remaining to be repurchased. Repurchases of our common stock under this plan are made from time to time, at our discretion, in the open market.\nA reconciliation of basic and diluted net income per share attributable to Deere & Company follows in millions, except per share amounts:\nNet income attributable to Deere & Company\n$\n10,166\n$\n7,131\n$\n5,963\nAverage shares outstanding\n292.2\n304.5\n311.6\nBasic per share\n$\n34.80\n$\n23.42\n$\n19.14\nAverage shares outstanding\n292.2\n304.5\n311.6\nEffect of dilutive stock options\n1.4\n1.8\n2.4\nTotal potential shares outstanding\n293.6\n306.3\n314.0\nDiluted per share\n$\n34.63\n$\n23.28\n$\n18.99\nShares excluded as antidilutive\n.1\n.2\n22. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe issue stock options and restricted stock units to key employees. Restricted stock units are also issued to nonemployee directors for their services as directors. Restricted stock units consist of service-based and performance/service-based awards.\nIn 2023, we changed the accounting treatment of the Long-Term Incentive Cash that is granted to certain employees. As the performance metric related to this incentive plan is based, in part, on the price of our shares, we now account for it in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718. At October 29, 2023, we are authorized to grant an additional 16.6 million shares related to stock options or restricted stock units. We currently use shares that have been repurchased through our stock repurchase programs to satisfy share option exercises. The stock awards vesting periods and the dividend equivalents earned during the vesting period follow:\nVesting\nDividend\nPeriod\nEquivalents\nStock options\n1-3 years\nNot included\nService-based RSUs\n1-3 years\nIncluded\nPerformance/service-based RSUs\n3 years\nNot included\nStock options expire ten years from the grant date. Performance/service-based awards are subject to a performance metric. The performance metric is based on our compound annual revenue growth rate, compared to a benchmark group of companies. The performance/service-based units award common stock in a range of zero to 200 percent for each unit granted based on the level of the metric achieved.\nThe fair value of stock options and restricted stock units is determined using our closing price on the grant date. These awards are expensed over the shorter of the award vesting period or the employees retirement eligibility period. The performance/service-based units expense is adjusted quarterly for the probable number of shares to be awarded. We recognize the effect of award forfeitures as an adjustment to compensation expense in the period the forfeiture occurs.\nThe total share-based compensation expense, recognized income tax benefits, and total grant-date fair values of stock options and restricted stock units vested consisted of the following:\nShare-based compensation expense\n$\n$\n$\nIncome tax benefits\nStock options and restricted stock units vested\nAt October 29, 2023, there was $93 of total unrecognized compensation cost from share-based compensation arrangements. This compensation is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 1.5 years.\nStock Options\nThe fair value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice option valuation model. The assumptions used for the binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of options follow:\nRisk-free interest rate*\n2.68%\n1.27%\n.47%\nExpected dividends\n1.1%\n1.2%\n1.2%\nVolatility*\n33.0%\n32.0%\n31.0%\nExpected term (in years)*\n5.1\n5.1\n5.5\n* Weighted-averages\nThe risk-free rates are based on U.S. Treasury security yields at the time of grant.

LEASES\nWe are both a lessee and a lessor. We lease for our own use warehouse facilities, office space, production equipment, information technology equipment, and vehicles. The financial services operations lease equipment produced or sold by us and a limited amount of other equipment to retail customers. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at the contract inception.\nLessee\nThe amounts of the lease liability and right of use asset are determined at lease commencement and are based on the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. The lease payments are discounted using our incremental borrowing rate since the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. We determine the incremental borrowing rate for each lease based on the lease term and the economic environment of the country where the asset will be used, adjusted as if the borrowings were collateralized. Leases with contractual periods greater than one year and that do not meet the finance lease criteria are classified as operating leases.\nWe have elected to combine lease and nonlease components, such as maintenance and utilities costs included in a lease contract, for all asset classes. Leases with an initial term of one year or less are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term and recorded in short-term lease expense. Variable lease expense includes warehouse facilities leases with payments based on utilization exceeding contractual minimum amounts and leases with payments indexed to inflation when the index changes after lease commencement.\nThe lease expense by type consisted of the following:\nOperating lease expense\n$\n$\n$\nShort-term lease expense\nVariable lease expense\nFinance lease:\nDepreciation expense\nInterest on lease liabilities\nTotal lease expense\n$\n$\n$\nOperating and finance lease right of use assets and lease liabilities follow:\nOperating leases:\nOther assets\n$\n$\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\nFinance leases:\nProperty and equipment - net\n$\n$\nShort-term borrowings\nLong-term borrowings\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n$\nThe weighted-average remaining lease terms in years and discount rates follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease terms:\nOperating leases\nFinance leases\nWeighted-average discount rates:\nOperating leases\n3.1%\n2.4%\nFinance leases\n3.6%\n1.9%\nLease payment amounts in each of the next five years at October 29, 2023 follow:\nOperating\nFinance\nDue in:\nLeases\nLeases\n$\n$\nLater years\nTotal lease payments\nLess: imputed interest\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n$\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities follows:\nOperating cash flows for operating leases\n$\n$\n$\nOperating cash flows for finance leases\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities follow:\nOperating leases\n$\n$\nFinance leases\nLessor\nWe lease equipment manufactured by us through John Deere Financial. Sales-type and direct financing leases are reported in Financing receivables - net. Operating leases are reported in Equipment on operating leases - net.\nAt the end of the majority of leases, the lessee has the option to purchase the underlying equipment for the contractual residual value or return it to the dealer. If the equipment is returned to the dealer, the dealer also has the option to purchase the equipment or return it to us for remarketing.\nWe estimate the residual values for operating leases at lease inception based on several factors, including lease term, expected hours of usage, historical wholesale sale prices, return experience, intended use of the equipment, market dynamics and trends, and dealer residual guarantees. We review residual value estimates during the lease term and test the carrying value of our operating lease assets for impairment when events or circumstances necessitate. The depreciation is adjusted on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term if residual value estimates change. Lease agreements include usage limits and specifications on\nmachine condition, which allow us to assess lessees for excess use or damages to the underlying equipment.\nWe have elected to combine lease and nonlease components. The nonlease components relate to preventative maintenance and extended warranty agreements financed by the retail customer. We have also elected to report consideration related to sales and value added taxes net of the related tax expense. Property taxes on leased assets are recorded on a gross basis in Finance and interest income and Other operating expenses. Variable lease revenues relate to property taxes on leased assets in certain markets and late fees.\nLease revenues earned by us follow:\nSales-type and direct finance lease revenues\n$\n$\n$\nOperating lease revenues\n1,312\n1,318\n1,423\nVariable lease revenues\nTotal lease revenues\n$\n1,493\n$\n1,498\n$\n1,598\nAt the time of accepting a lease that qualifies as a sales-type or direct financing lease, we record the gross amount of lease payments receivable, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and unearned finance income. The unearned finance income is recognized as revenue over the lease term using the interest method.\nSales-type and direct financing lease receivables by market follow:\nAgriculture and turf\n$\n1,078\n$\n1,118\nConstruction and forestry\n1,048\n1,167\nTotal\n2,126\n2,285\nGuaranteed residual values\nUnguaranteed residual values\nLess: unearned finance income\n(350)\n(285)\nFinancing lease receivables\n$\n2,556\n$\n2,547\nScheduled payments, including guaranteed residual values, on sales-type and direct financing lease receivables at October 29, 2023 follow:\nDue in:\n$\n1,453\nLater years\nTotal\n$\n2,849\nLease payments from operating leases are recorded as income on a straight-line method over the lease terms.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To determine fair value, we use various methods including market and income approaches. We utilize valuation models and techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs. The models are industry-standard models that consider various assumptions including time values and yield curves as well as other economic measures. These valuation techniques are consistently applied.\nLevel 1 measurements consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 measurements include significant other observable inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets; observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves; and other market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 measurements include significant unobservable inputs.\nFair values of the financing receivables that were issued long-term were based on the discounted values of their related cash flows at interest rates currently being offered by us for similar financing receivables. The fair values of the remaining financing receivables approximated the carrying amounts.\nFair values of long-term borrowings and short-term securitization borrowings were based on current market quotes for identical or similar borrowings and credit risk, or on the discounted values of their related cash flows at current market interest rates.\nThe fair values of financial instruments that do not approximate the carrying values at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follow:\nCarrying\nFair\nCarrying\nFair\nValue\nValue*\nValue\nValue*\nFinancing receivables - net\n$\n43,673\n$\n42,777\n$\n36,634\n$\n35,526\nFinancing receivables securitized - net\n7,335\n7,056\n5,936\n5,698\nShort-term securitization borrowings\n6,995\n6,921\n5,711\n5,577\nLong-term borrowings due within one year**\n8,331\n8,156\n7,466\n7,322\nLong-term borrowings**\n38,428\n36,873\n33,566\n31,852\n* Fair value measurements above were Level 3 for all financing receivables and Level 2 for all borrowings.\n**\nValues exclude finance lease liabilities that are presented as borrowings (see Note 24).\nAssets and liabilities measured at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 at fair value on a recurring basis follow, excluding our cash equivalents, which were carried at a cost that approximates fair value and consisted of money market funds and time deposits:\nLevel 1:\nMarketable securities\nInternational equity securities\n$\n$\nInternational mutual funds securities\nU.S. equity fund\nU.S. fixed income fund\nU.S. government debt securities\nTotal Level 1 marketable securities\nLevel 2:\nMarketable securities\nCorporate debt securities\nInternational debt securities\nMortgage-backed securities*\nMunicipal debt securities\nU.S. government debt securities\nTotal Level 2 marketable securities\nOther assets - Derivatives\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses - Derivatives\n1,130\n1,231\nLevel 3:\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses - Deferred consideration\n* Primarily issued by U.S. government sponsored enterprises.\nFair value, nonrecurring level 3 measurements from impairments at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follow:\nFair Value\nLosses\n2022 1\nInventories\n$\n$\nProperty and equipment - net\n$\nOther intangible assets - net\nOther assets\n1 Related to assessments on the Russian operations, performed at May 1, 2022 and updated on July 31, 2022 and October 30, 2022.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies we use to measure certain financial instruments on the balance sheets at fair value. For more information on asset impairments, see Note 4.\nMarketable securities - The portfolio of investments is valued on a market approach (matrix pricing model) in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, credit risk, and prepayment speeds. Funds are valued using the funds net asset value, based on the fair value of the underlying securities.\nDerivatives - Our derivative financial instruments consist of interest rate contracts (swaps), foreign currency exchange contracts (futures, forwards and swaps), and cross-currency interest rate contracts (swaps). The portfolio is valued based on an income approach (discounted cash flow) using market observable inputs, including swap curves and both forward and spot exchange rates for currencies.\nFinancing receivables - Specific reserve impairments are based on the fair value of the collateral, which is measured using a market approach (appraisal values or realizable values). Inputs include a selection of realizable values (see Note 11).\nInventories - The impairment was based on net realizable value, less reasonably predictable selling and disposal costs.\nProperty and equipment - net - The valuations were based on cost and market approaches. The inputs include replacement cost estimates adjusted for physical deterioration and economic obsolescence, or quoted prices when available.\nOther intangible assets - net - In 2022, we considered external valuations based on our probability weighted cash flow analysis.\nOther assets - In 2021, the impairments were measured at the fair value of a right of use operating lease asset.\n26. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nFair values of our derivative instruments and the associated notional amounts at the end of 2023 and 2022 were as follows. Assets are recorded in Other assets, while liabilities are recorded in Accounts payable and accrued expenses.\nFair Value\nNotional\nAssets\nLiabilities\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n1,500\n$\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate contracts\n12,691\n$\nNot designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts\n13,853\nForeign exchange contracts\n8,117\nCross-currency interest rate contracts\nCash flow hedges:\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n1,950\n$\nFair value hedges:\nInterest rate contracts\n10,112\n$\n1,004\nNot designated as hedging instruments:\nInterest rate contracts\n10,568\nForeign exchange contracts\n8,185\nCross-currency interest rate contracts\nThe amounts recorded, at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, in the consolidated balance sheets related to borrowings designated in fair value hedging relationships were as follows.

There were no gains or losses reclassified from OCI to earnings based on the probability that the original forecasted transaction would not occur.\nCounterparty Risk and Collateral\nDerivative instruments are subject to significant concentrations of credit risk to the banking sector. We manage individual counterparty exposure by setting limits that consider the credit rating of the counterparty, the credit default swap spread of the counterparty, and other financial commitments and exposures between us and the counterparty banks. All interest rate derivatives are transacted under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) documentation. Some of these agreements include credit support provisions. Each master agreement permits the net settlement of amounts owed in the event of default or termination.\nCertain of our derivative agreements contain credit support provisions that may require us to post collateral based on the size of the net liability positions and credit ratings. The aggregate fair value of all derivatives with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, was $1.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. In accordance with the limits established in these agreements, we posted $659 of cash collateral at October 29, 2023 and $701 at October 30, 2022. In addition, we paid $8 of collateral that was outstanding at both October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 to participate in an international futures market to hedge currency exposure, not included in the table below.\nDerivatives are recorded without offsetting for netting arrangements or collateral. The impact on the derivative assets and liabilities related to netting arrangements and collateral at October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022 follows:\nGross Amounts\nNetting\nNet\nRecognized\nArrangements\nCollateral\nAmount\nAssets\n$\n$\n(152)\n$\nLiabilities\n1,130\n(152)\n$\n(659)\nAssets\n$\n$\n(179)\n$\n(54)\n$\nLiabilities\n1,231\n(179)\n(701)\n27. SEGMENT DATA\nOur operations are presently organized and reported in four business segments. This presentation is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker (the CEO) assesses the performance of the segments and makes decisions about resource allocations.\nThe PPA segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for production-scale growers of large grains, small grains, cotton, and sugarcane. The main products include large and certain mid-size tractors, combines, cotton pickers, sugarcane harvesters and loaders, and soil preparation, seeding, application, and crop care equipment.\nThe SAT segment defines, develops, and delivers global equipment and technology solutions to unlock customer value for dairy and livestock producers, high-value crop producers, and turf and utility customers. The segments primary products include certain mid-size, utility, and compact utility tractors, as well as hay and forage equipment, riding and commercial lawn equipment, golf course equipment, and utility vehicles.\nThe CF segment defines, develops, and delivers a broad range of machines and technology solutions organized along the earthmoving, forestry, and roadbuilding production systems. The segments primary products include crawler dozers and loaders, four-wheel-drive loaders, excavators, skid-steer loaders, milling machines, and log harvesters.\nThe products and services produced by the segments above are marketed through independent retail dealer networks and major retail outlets. For roadbuilding products in certain markets outside the U.S. and Canada, the products are sold through company-owned sales and service subsidiaries.\nThe financial services segment finances sales and leases by John Deere dealers of new and used production and precision agriculture equipment, small agriculture and turf equipment, and construction and forestry equipment. In addition, the financial services segment provides wholesale financing to dealers of the foregoing equipment, finances retail revolving charge accounts, and offers extended equipment warranties.\nBecause of integrated manufacturing operations and common administrative and marketing support, a substantial number of allocations must be made to determine operating segment data.\nIdentifiable assets assigned to the operating segments are those the units actively manage, consisting of trade receivables, inventories, property and equipment, intangible assets, and certain other assets.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 29, 2023 and October 30, 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 29, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 15, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSales Incentives - Refer to Note 2 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company provides retail discount or financing sales incentives programs to dealers that are due when the dealer sells the equipment to a retail customer.\nThe estimated cost of these programs is based on:\n\u25cf historical data,\n\u25cf announced and expected incentive programs,\n\u25cf field inventory levels, and\n\u25cf forecasted sales volumes.\nAt the time a sale is recognized, the Company records an estimate of the sales incentive costs. The final cost is determined at the time of the retail sale.\nThere are numerous programs available at any time, and new programs may be announced after the Company records the equipment sale to the dealer. Changes in the mix and types of sales incentive programs affect these estimates, which are reviewed quarterly. Actual cost differences from the original cost estimate are recognized in Net sales. A key assumption is the predictive value of the historical percentage of retail sales incentive costs to retail sales.\nWe identified the United States and Canada sales incentive accrual as a critical audit matter because estimating sales incentive costs requires significant judgment by management and changes in historical percentage of sales incentive costs to retail sales by dealers could have a material impact on the sales incentive accrual. Auditing managements assumptions about the predictive nature of historical sales incentive costs involves a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort to evaluate the reasonableness of managements estimates.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to testing managements assumption that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs included the following, among others:\n\u25cf We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the assumptions used to estimate the sales incentive accrual.\n\u25cf We evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast future incentive costs by performing a retrospective review that involved comparing actual incentive costs to managements historical forecasts.\n\u25cf We tested the completeness of the population used in the accrual calculation by inspecting incentive program communications to dealers to ensure programs offered were appropriately included in the calculation. We tested the accuracy of sales incentives transactions by verifying amounts settled with dealers.\n\u25cf We evaluated the reasonableness of managements assumption that historical sales incentive costs are predictive of future incentive costs by:\no Considering the impact of changes in the current economic conditions and competitive environment.\no Comparing historical and current sales incentive data for eligible products in the following manner:\n\u25fe Type and number of programs\n\u25fe Geography\n\u25fe Program size and duration\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Refer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of the Companys receivable portfolio. The allowance is measured on a collective basis for receivables with similar risk characteristics. Receivables that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. Risk characteristics include:\n\u25cf finance product category,\n\u25cf market,\n\u25cf geography,\n\u25cf credit risk, and\n\u25cf remaining balance.\nThe Company utilizes loss forecast models to estimate expected credit losses. Transition matrix models are used for large and complex retail customer receivable pools. These models are used for more than 90 percent of retail customer receivables. Historical portfolio performance and current delinquency levels are used to forecast future defaults. Estimated recovery rates are applied to the estimated default balance to calculate the expected credit losses.\nThe model output is adjusted for forecasted economic conditions, which may include the following economic indicators:\n\u25cf commodity prices,\n\u25cf industry equipment sales,\n\u25cf unemployment rates, and\n\u25cf housing starts.\nManagement reviews each models output quarterly, and qualitative adjustments are incorporated as necessary.\nWe identified the allowance for credit losses estimated for the Companys United States and Canada receivable portfolios by the transition matrix models and related reasonable and supportable forecasts and qualitative adjustments as a critical audit matter because determining the appropriate methodology and assumptions used in the estimate requires significant judgment by management. Given the subjective nature and judgment applied by management to determine the allowance for credit losses, auditing the methodology and assumptions requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve credit specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures to test the allowance for credit losses estimated for the Companys United States and Canada receivable portfolios by the transition matrix models and related reasonable and supportable forecasts and qualitative adjustments included the following, among others:\n\u25fe We tested the effectiveness of managements controls over the methodology, data and assumptions used to estimate the allowance for credit losses.\n\u25fe We tested the accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the underlying historical data used in the Companys transition matrix models.\n\u25fe With the assistance of our credit specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness and accuracy of the transition matrix models used to estimate the allowance for credit losses, including model assumptions and the selection and application of relevant risk characteristics and use of qualitative adjustments.\n\u25fe We evaluated qualitative adjustments to the model estimate. Our evaluation included:\no Comparison of qualitative factors used by the Company to source data provided by the Company and/or to externally available data.\no Consideration and evaluation of contradictory evidence.\n\u25fe We evaluated managements ability to accurately forecast credit losses by performing a retrospective review, which involved comparing actual credit losses to historical estimates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nDecember 15, 2023\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 1910.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Deere & Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Deere & Company and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 29, 2023 of the Company and our report dated December 15, 2023, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nDecember 15, 2023\nIndex to Exhibits\n3.1\nCertificate of Incorporation (Exhibit 3.1 to Form 10-Q of registrant for the quarter ended July 28, 2019, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n3.2\nCertificate of Designation Preferences and Rights of Series A Participating Preferred Stock (Exhibit 3.2 to Form 10-K of registrant for the year ended October 31, 1998, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n3.3\nBylaws, as amended (Exhibit 3.2 to Form 10-Q of registrant for the quarter ended July 30, 2023, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n4.1\nForm of common stock certificate (Exhibit 4.6 to Form 10-K of registrant for the year ended October 31, 1998, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n4.2\nIndenture, dated September 25, 2008, between the registrant and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (Exhibit 4.1 to the registration statement on Form S-3ASR no. 333-153704 filed September 26, 2008, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n4.3\nIndenture, dated June 15, 2020, among Deere Funding Canada Corporation, as issuer, the registrant, as guarantor, and The Bank of New York Mellon, as Trustee (Exhibit 4.3 to the registration statement on Form S-3ASR no. 333-239165 filed June 15, 2020, Securities and Exchange Commission File Number 1-4121*)\n4.4\nTerms and Conditions of the Euro Medium Term Notes, published March 31, 2022, applicable to the U.S. $6,000,000,000 Euro Medium Term Note Programme of the registrant, John Deere Capital Corporation, John Deere Bank S.A., and John Deere Cash Management (Exhibit 4.5 to Form 10-K of registrant for the year ended October 30, 2022.
