    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral Overview\nWe were incorporated on April 29, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. We originally intended to engage in the business of developing, marketing and sell shampoo, conditioner and other hair care products made from natural ingredients. Initial operations included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. However, we are no longer in the business of developing and selling shampoo, conditioner or any other hair care products. We are presently considered a shell company and our current business plan is to seek to acquire a viable ongoing business either by acquisition, merger or other form of business combination transaction. In accordance with our current business model, on December 28, 2017 we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended January 9, 2018 (Merger Agreement), with Yuenglings Ice Cream Corporation, a private Pennsylvania corporation (Yuenglings). On June 13, 2018, the Company informed Yuenglings by written notice that the Company has terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 28, 2017. The reason for the termination was the failure of Yuenglings to complete the audit of its financial statements as required by the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nCorporate Facilities\nOur administrative and executive offices located at 311 Bay Street, Unit 3405, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5H 4G5 which are provided by our Chief Executive Officer without charge.\nEmerging Growth Company\nWe are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act 0f 2012 (JOBS Act) and may take advantage of certain exemptions from certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies included but not limited to, not being required to comply with auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote of shareholders on executive compensation and any golden parachute payments not previously approved.\nWe will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our revenues exceed $1 billion; (ii) the date on which we issue more than $1 billion of non-convertible debt in a three year period; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933,as amended; or (iv) when the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliated exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nTo the extent we continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, after we cease to qualify as an emerging growth company, certain of the exemptions available to us as an emerging growth company may continue to be available to us as smaller reporting company including (i) not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; and (ii) scaled executive compensation disclosures; and (iii) the requirement to provide only two years of audited consolidated financial statements instead of three Item 1A Risk Factors.\nAs a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item.  Item 2. Properties\nWe do not own any properties at this time and do not have presently any agreements to acquire any properties. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are not involved in any legal proceedings Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nOur stock symbol on OTC Pink is SNHR. Our common stock is not currently quoted on the OTC Pink inter-dealer quotation service maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc., accordingly, there is presently no active public market for our common stock.\nOur common stock is subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, known as the Penny Stock Rule, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, brokers/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction prior to sale. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also has rules that regulate broker/dealer practices in connection with transactions in penny stocks. Penny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00, other than securities registered on certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in that security is provided by the exchange or system. The Penny Stock Rules requires a broker/dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document prepared by the SEC that provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker/dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker/dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customers account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker/dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customers confirmation. These disclosure requirements have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock. As a result of these rules, investors may find it difficult to sell their shares.\nAs of the date of this report, we have 14,578,506 shares of common stock issued and outstanding held by 17 stockholders of record.\nDividend Policy\nTo date, we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock. It is anticipated that our future earnings will be retained to finance our continuing development. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any, to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our Board of Directors has the discretion to declare and pay dividends in the future. Payment of dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital requirements, and any other factors that our Board of Directors deems relevant.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nDuring the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, we did not issue any shares of common or preferred stock. Item 6. Selected Financial Data.\nThere is no selected financial data required to be filed for a smaller reporting company. Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our financial statements and notes thereto. This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our predictions.\nPlan of Operations\nAt the present time, the Company has no business operations. The Company will continue to seek other business opportunities either through the acquisition of, or merger with, an existing company with ongoing business operations. As of March 31, 2018, the Company had not generated any revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. At March 31, 2018, the Company had sustained net loss of $28,815 and had an accumulated deficit of $223,021.\nThe Companys independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon these operations successfully generating cash flow for the Company, financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of the target company with the Company.\nBalance sheet as at March 31, 2018 and\nCash\nAt March 31, 2018 we had cash of $610 compared to $622 as of March 31, 2017.\nPrepaid asset\nAt March 31, 2018 we had prepaid expenses of $615 compared to $0 as at March 31, 2017.\nAccrued liabilities\nAccrued liabilities at March 31, 2018 totaled $19,509 compared to $2,249 as at March 31, 2017. The increase is attributable to the issuance by the Company of convertible promissory notes and promissory notes payable.\nPayable to related parties\nAt March 31, 2018, the Company had convertible notes payable and promissory notes payable to related parties totaling $12,500 compared to $0 as at March 31, 2017.\nShareholder advances and receivable\nShareholder advances represent expenses paid by the owners from personal funds. The amount of advance as at March 31, 2018 were $236 which was the same the amount as at March 31, 2017.\nIncome statement for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nRevenues for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nThe Company did not have any revenues from any sources in 2018 or 2017 and no revenues are expected in the near term until the Company locates and completes an acquisition of an operational business.\nExpenses for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nOperating expenses increased from $53,148 as of March 31, 2017 to $112,277. The increase was principally attributable to an increase in professional fees for legal and accounting services associated with the Companys financial and periodic reports filed obligations with the SEC,\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017\nWe had nominal assets at both March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2018, we had $610 in cash as compared to $622 at March 31, 2017. Total liabilities at March 31, 2018 were $130,898 including, accrued expenses of $19,509, convertible note payable related party of $10,000, net of unamortized discount, promissory notes payable-related parties of $12,500, and advances from related stockholders at $236. At March 31, 2017, liabilities totaled $2,485 consisting of $2,249 in accrued expenses and $236 as advances from related stockholders. Advances from stockholders are due on demand with interest due on the outstanding balance. Unless our officers/related stockholders continue to advance funds to the Company, of which there can be no assurance, or the Company receives an infusion of capital, it is unlikely that the Company will continue operations. At March 31, 2018, we had an accumulated deficit of $(223,021) as compared to $(94,206) at March 31, 2017.\nGoing Concern\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.\nAs reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2018, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may never be sufficient to commence and support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 and 2017\nPage\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nPCAOB ID 5525-Fruci & Associates II, PLC\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nConsolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements -\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Seguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2018, and the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders deficit, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). The financial statements of Seguin Natural Hair Products, Inc. as of March 31, 2017 were audited by other auditors whose report dated July 12, 2017 on those statements included an explanatory paragraph regarding substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of March 31, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nGoing Concern\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has generated no revenue to date and has not yet commenced principal operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. Managements plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2019.\nSpokane, Washington\nDecember 9, 2022\nSEGUIN NATURAL HAIR PRODUCTS, INC.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFOR THE YEARS ENDED MARCH 31, 2018 AND 2017\nFinancial Statements\nBalance Sheets as of March 31, 2018 and 2017\nStatements of Operations for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nStatements of Stockholders' Equity for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nStatements of Cash Flows for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to Financial Statements -\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nBalance Sheets\nMarch 31,\nASSETS\nCURRENT ASSETS:\nCash $ 610 $ 622\nPrepaid Expense- attorney trust account -\nTotal Current Assets 1,225\nTotal Assets $ 1,225 $ 622\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT\nCURRENT LIABILITIES:\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities $ 9,289 $ 2,249\nAccrued Interest Payable 10,220 -\nConvertible note payable related party, net of $5,000 unamortized discount 5,000 -\nConvertible note payable 87,806 -\nDerivative Liability 12,857 -\nAdvances from stockholders\nTotal Current Liabilities 125,408 2,485\nLONG TERM LIABILITIES:\nLoan Payable to related party $ 5,490 $ -\nTotal Long Term Liabilities 5,490 -\nTotal Liabilities $ 130,898 $ 2,485\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nSTOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT:\nCommon stock par value $0.0001: 500,000,000 shares authorized;\n5,825,000 and 16,500,000 shares issued and outstanding as of\nMarch 31, 2018 and March 31, 2017; respectively $ 582 $ 1,650\nAdditional paid-in capital 92,766 90,693\nAccumulated deficit (223,021 ) (94,206 )\nTotal Stockholders' Deficit (129,673 ) (1,863 )\nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders' Deficit $ 1,225 $ 622\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Operations\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\nOperating Expenses\nProfessional fees $ 109,437 $ 38,909\nGeneral and administrative expenses 2,840 14,239\nTotal operating expenses 112,277 53,148\nLoss from Operations (112,277 ) (53,148 )\nOther Expenses\nInterest expense (8,681 ) -\nDerivative liability loss (2,857 )\nDerivative discount amortization (5,000 )\nTotal other expense (16,538 ) -\nIncome Tax Provision - -\nNet Loss $ (128,815 ) $ (53,148 )\nNet Loss per Common Share - Basic and Diluted $ (0.01 ) $ (0.00 )\nWeighted average common shares outstanding: - basic and diluted 14,828,604 16,500,000\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Changes in Stockholders' Deficit\nFor the Years Ended March 31, 2018 and\nCommon Stock, $0.0001 Par Value Additional\nTotal\nNumber of\nPaid-in Accumulated Stockholders'\nShares Amount Capital Deficit (Deficit)\nBalance, March 31, 2016 16,500,000 $ 1,650 $ 63,332 $ (41,058 ) $ 23,924\nCapital Contribution - - 27,361 - 27,361\nNet loss - - - (53,148 ) (53,148 )\nBalance, March 31, 2017 16,500,000 1,650 90,693 (94,206 ) (1,863 )\nCommon stock issued for services 50,000 - -\nCapital Contribution - - 1,000 - 1,000\nRetirement of common stock (10,725,000 ) (1,073 ) 1,073 - -\nNet loss\n(128,815 ) (128,815 )\nBalance, March 31, 2018 5,825,000 $ 582 92,766 $ (223,021 ) $ (129,673 )\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products, Inc.\nStatements of Cash Flows\nFor the Year Ended March 31,\nCASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES:\nNet loss $ (128,815 ) $ (53,148 )\nAdjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities\nChange in fair value - derivatives 2,857\nStock based compensation -\nAmortization of debt discount & other financing costs 5,000 -\nChanges in operating assets and liabilities:\nPrepaid Expenses (615 ) 2,379\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities 17,260 2,249\nNet cash used in operating activities (104,308 ) (48,520 )\nCASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES:\nProceeds from capital contribution 1,000 27,361\nProceeds from related party convertible note 87,806 -\nLoan from related party 5,490 -\nProceeds from convertible note 10,000 -\nNet cash provided by financing activities 104,296 27,361\nNet change in cash (12 ) (21,159 )\nCash at beginning of the reporting period 21,781\nCash at end of the reporting period $ 610 $ 622\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF CASH FLOWS INFORMATION:\nInterest paid $ - $ -\nIncome tax paid $ - $ -\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS\nExpenses paid by related party on behalf of the company $ 16,095 $ -\nRetirement of common stock $ 1,073 $ -\nSee accompanying notes to the financial statements.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nNote 1 - Organization\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on April 29, 2014 under the laws of the State of Nevada. Initial operations have included organization and incorporation, target market identification, marketing plans, capital formation and property acquisitions. A substantial portion of the Companys activities has involved developing a business plan and establishing contacts and visibility in the marketplace. The Company has generated no revenues since inception.\nWe are no longer in the business of developing and selling shampoo, conditioner or any other hair care products.\nOn December 28, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger as amended January 9, 2018 (Merger Agreement), with Yuenglings Ice Cream Corporation, a private Pennsylvania corporation (Yuenglings).\nOn June 13, 2018, the Company informed Yuenglings by written notice that the Company has terminated the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated December 28, 2017. The reason for the termination was the failure of Yuenglings to complete the audit of its financial statements as required by the terms of the Merger Agreement.\nNote 2 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices\nThe Management of the Company is responsible for the selection and use of appropriate accounting policies and the appropriateness of accounting policies and their application. Critical accounting policies and practices are those that are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results and require managements most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys significant and critical accounting policies and practices are disclosed below as required by generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP).\nFiscal Year End\nThe Company elected March 31st as its fiscal year end date upon its formation.\nUse of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date(s) of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period(s).\nCritical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. The Companys critical accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the financial statements were:\n(i) Assumption as a going concern: Management assumes that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business;\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\n(ii) Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets: Management assumes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets resulting from its net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards for Federal income tax purposes that may be offset against future taxable income was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance. Management made this assumption based on (a) the Company has incurred recurring losses, (b) general economic conditions, (d) its ability to raise additional funds to support its daily operations by way of a public or private offering, among other factors.\nThese significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to these estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.\nManagement bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.\nManagement regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly.\nActual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820-10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35- 37 are described below:\nLevel 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable.\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and accrued expenses approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of this instrument.\nTransactions involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive, free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such representations can be substantiated.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the identification of related parties and disclosure of related party transactions.\nPursuant to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include a. affiliates of the Company (Affiliate means, with respect to any specified Person, any other Person that, directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by or is under common control with such Person, as such terms are used in and construed under Rule 405 under the Securities Act); b. entities for which investments in their equity securities would be required, absent the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option Subsection of Section 825-10-15, to be accounted for by the equity method by the investing entity; c. trusts for the benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d. principal owners of the Company; e. management of the Company; f. other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests; and g. other parties that can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.\nThe financial statements shall include disclosures of material related party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated in the preparation of consolidated or combined financial statements is not required in those statements. The disclosures shall include: a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved; b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions on the financial statements; c. the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods for which income statements are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in the preceding period; and d. amounts due from or to related parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.\nCommitment and Contingencies\nThe Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain conditions may exist as of the date the financial statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company but which will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The Company assesses such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be sought therein.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nIf the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the Companys financial statements. If the assessment indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and material, would be disclosed.\nLoss contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605, \"Revenue Recognition.\" This ASU is based on the principle that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The ASU also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASC 606-10-50-5 requires that entities disclose disaggregated revenue information in categories (such as type of good or service, geography, market, type of contract, etc.) that depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow are affected by economic factors. ASC 606-10-55-89 explains that the extent to which an entity's revenue is disaggregated depends on the facts and circumstances that pertain to the entity's contracts with customers and that some entities may need to use more than one type of category to meet the objective for disaggregating revenue. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, and allowed entities the option to early adopt the new revenue standard as of the original effective date. There have been multiple standards updates amending this guidance or providing corrections or improvements on issues in the guidance. The requirements for these standards relating to Topic 606 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. This standard permitted adoption using one of two transition methods, either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.\nThe Company adopted these standards for the year ended March 31, 2018 using the modified retrospective method. The adoption of these standards did not have an impact on the Company's Condensed Statements of Operations in the first quarter of 2018.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Income Tax Provision\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Section 740-10-25). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the accompanying balance sheets, as well as tax credit carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as management deems necessary.\nManagement makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. In managements opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years. If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates, additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary.\nTax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions\nThe Company discloses tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions pursuant to the ASC Paragraph 740-10-50-15.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share (\"EPS\") is the amount of earnings attributable to each share of common stock. For convenience, the term is used to refer to either earnings or loss per share. EPS is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Pursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-10 through 260-10-45-16 Basic EPS shall be computed by dividing income available to common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted- average number of common shares outstanding (the denominator) during the period. Income available to common stockholders shall be computed by deducting both the dividends declared in the period on preferred stock (whether or not paid) and the dividends accumulated for the period on cumulative preferred stock (whether or not earned) from income from continuing operations (if that amount appears in the income statement) and also from net income. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential common shares had been issued during the period to reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares issuable through contingent shares issuance arrangement, stock options or warrants.\nPursuant to ASC Paragraphs 260-10-45-45-21 through 260-10-45-45-23 Diluted EPS shall be based on the most advantageous conversion rate or exercise price from the standpoint of the security holder. The dilutive effect of outstanding call options and warrants (and their equivalents) issued by the reporting entity shall be reflected in diluted EPS by application of the treasury stock method unless the provisions of paragraphs 260-10-45-35 through 45-36 and 260-10-55-8 through 55-11 require that another method be applied. Equivalents of options and warrants include non-vested stock granted to employees, stock purchase contracts, and partially paid stock subscriptions (see paragraph 260-10-55-23). Anti-dilutive contracts, such as purchased put options and purchased call options, shall be excluded from diluted EPS. Under the treasury stock method: a. Exercise of options and warrants shall be assumed at the beginning of the period (or at time of issuance, if later) and common shares shall be assumed to be issued. b. The proceeds from exercise shall be assumed to be used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. (See paragraphs 260-10-45-29 and 260-10-55-4 through 55-5.) c. The incremental shares (the difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased) shall be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS computation.\nThere were no potentially dilutive common shares outstanding for the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2017.\nCash Flows Reporting\nThe Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash receipts and payments according to whether they stem from operating, investing, or financing activities and provides definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or reconciliation method (Indirect method) as defined by paragraph 230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and payments.\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements were issued. Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which will amend current lease accounting to require lessees to recognize (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis, and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model. This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which relates to the accounting for employee share-based payments. This standard addresses several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard as of December 31, 2016. The adoption of this standard had no effect on our results of operation, cash flows, other than presentation, or financial condition.\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this Update clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. Topic 606 includes implementation guidance on (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity's intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended render more detailed implementation guidance with the expectation to reduce the degree of judgement necessary to comply with Topic 606. The Company is has reviewed the provisions of this ASU to and determined there will be no material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.\nIn April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments\" ASU 2016 - provides guidance regarding the classification of certain items within the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not believe this ASU will have an impact on our results of operation, cash flows, other than presentation, or financial condition\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nOn November 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash\", a consensus of the FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (the \"Task Force\"). The new standard requires that the statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Entities will also be required to reconcile such total to amounts on the balance sheet and disclose the nature of the restrictions. ASU No. 2016-18 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not believe this ASU will have an impact on our results of operation, cash flows, other than presentation, or financial condition\nThe Company evaluated all recent accounting pronouncements issued and determined that the adoption of these pronouncements would not have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations or cash flows of the Company.\nNote 3 - Going Concern\nThe Company has elected to adopt early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entitys Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15).\nThe Companys financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. As reflected in the financial statements, the Company had an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2018, a net loss and net cash used in operating activities for the reporting period then ended. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Company is attempting to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue; however, the Companys cash position may not be sufficient to support its daily operations. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to commence operations and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional funds.\nThe financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.\nNote 4 - Convertible Notes - Related party\nOn October 31, 2017, the Company entered into a Promissory Note with an investor (the Lender) who has significant influence over the Companys affairs for up to $1,400.

Based on the guidance in paragraph 815-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification the Company concluded these instruments were required to be accounted for as derivatives on issuance date. The Company records the fair value of the Convertible Notes Payable and certain warrants that are classified as derivatives on issuance date and the fair value changes on each reporting date reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as Change in Fair Value - derivatives. These derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under paragraph 815-10-05-4 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and are disclosed on the balance sheet under Derivative Liabilities.\nThe Company follows paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Paragraph 820- 10-35-37) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10- 35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels. The three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:\nLevel 1 Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.\nLevel 2 Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.\nLevel 3 Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable inputs and not corroborated by market data.\nFinancial assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input is unobservable\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nThe fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. If the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\nThe carrying amounts of the Companys financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepayments and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.\nThe Companys Level 3 financial liabilities consist of the Convertible Notes Payable issued September 28, 2017, for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. We have valued the automatic conditional conversion, re-pricing/down-round, change of control; default and follow-on offering provisions using a lattice model, for which management understands the methodologies. These models incorporate transaction details such as Company stock price, contractual terms, maturity, risk free rates, as well as assumptions about future financings, volatility, and holder behavior as of issuance and March 31, 2018.\nThe derivative element of the convertible notes was fair valued using the multinomial lattice model.

No tax benefit has been reported with respect to these net operating loss carry-forwards because the Company believes that the realization of the Companys net deferred tax assets of approximately $45,184 was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are offset by a full valuation allowance.\nDeferred tax assets consist primarily of the tax effect of NOL carry-forwards. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding the probability of its realization. The valuation allowance increased approximately $25,401 and $17,634 for the year ended March 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nComponents of deferred tax assets in the balance sheets are as follows:\nSchedule Of Components of deferred tax assets\nMarch 31,\nMarch 31,\nNet deferred tax assets - non-current:\nExpected income tax benefit from NOL carry-forwards $ 45,184 $ 19,783\nLess valuation allowance (45,184 ) (19,783 )\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance $ - $ -\nSeguin Natural Hair Products Inc.\nMarch 31, 2018 and 2017\nNotes to the Financial Statements\nIncome Tax Provision in the Statements of Operations\nA reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate as a percentage of income before income tax provision is as follows:\nSchedule of effective income tax rate reconciliation\nFor the Year\nended March\n31,\nFor the Year\nended March\n31,\nFederal statutory income tax rate 34.0 % (34.0 )%\nChange in tax rate estimate (13.0 ) -\nChange in valuation allowance 21.0 % 34.0 %\nNote 10- Subsequent events\nOn April 16, 2018, the Company (the Borrower) entered into a Promissory Note Agreement (the Note) with an investor (the Lender) who has significant influence for up to $1,000.

The conversion price for the shares was $0.00927 per share and the aggregate principal amount converted under the Notes was $102,145.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 COSO Framework or COSO). Based on this evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020. Management identified segregation of duties & maintenance of current accounting records as material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is in the continuous process of improving the internal control over financial reporting by engaging a Certified Public Accountant as a consultant to mitigate some of the identified weaknesses. The Company is still in its development stage and intends on bringing in necessary resources to address the weaknesses once full operations have commenced. Management concludes that internal control over financial reporting is ineffective at December 31, 2020.\nManagements Report of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) Rules 13a-15(e) and 15-d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report (the Evaluation Date). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer each concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Companys internal controls over financial reporting during its fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other information\nNot applicable.\nPART III Item 10.

Management has determined not to establish an audit committee at present because of our limited resources and limited operating activities do not warrant the formation of an audit committee or the expense of doing so. We do not have a financial expert serving on the Board of Directors or employed as an officer based on managements belief that the cost of obtaining the services of a person who meets the criteria for a financial expert under Item 401(e) of Regulation S-B is beyond its limited financial resources and the financial skills of such an expert are simply not required or necessary for us to maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting in light of the limited scope and simplicity of accounting issues raised in its consolidated financial statements at this stage of its development.
