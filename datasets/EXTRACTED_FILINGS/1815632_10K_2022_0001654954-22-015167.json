Properties\nOur executive offices are located at 8565 South Eastern Avenue, Suite 150 Las Vegas, Nevada 89123. This space is sufficient to meet our needs, however, once we expand our business to a significant degree, we will have to find a larger space. We do not foresee any significant difficulties in obtaining any required additional space. We do not currently own any real property. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, we may become subject to various legal proceedings that are incidental to the ordinary conduct of its business. Although we cannot accurately predict the amount of any liability that may ultimately arise with respect to any of these matters, it makes provision for potential liabilities when it deems them probable and reasonably estimable. These provisions are based on current information and legal advice and may be adjusted from time to time according to developments.\nWe know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial stockholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures\nNot applicable.\nPART II Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur Articles of Incorporation authorize us to issue 50,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001.\nThe following statements relating to the capital stock set forth the material terms of the securities of our company. Reference is also made to the more detailed provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws, copies of which are filed as exhibits to this registration statement.\nVoting Rights: Except as otherwise required by law or as may be provided by the resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the issuance of Common Stock, all rights to vote and all voting power shall be vested in the holders of Common Stock. Each share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote.\nNo Cumulative Voting: Except as may be provided by the resolutions of the board of directors authorizing the issuance of Common Stock, cumulative voting by any shareholder is expressly denied.\nNo Preemptive Rights: Preemptive rights shall not exist with respect to shares of Common Stock or securities convertible into shares of Common Stock of the Company.\nDividends: We have not paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock since inception and presently anticipate that all earnings, if any, will be retained for development of our business and that no dividends on our Common Stock will be declared in the foreseeable future. Any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon, among other things, future earnings, operating and financial condition, capital requirements, general business conditions and other pertinent facts. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any dividends on our Common Stock will be paid in the future.\nRights upon Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding-Up of the Company: Upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the remaining net assets shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock.\nPreferred Stock\nWe have no preferred stock authorized.\nSecurities Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans\nOn December 8, 2021, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2021 Equity Compensation Plan (the Equity Compensation Plan) to provide employees, certain consultants and advisors who perform services for us, and non-employee members of our Board of Directors, with the opportunity to receive grants of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, stock awards, stock units and other stock-based awards. We have 10,000,000 common stock shares authorized under the Equity Compensation Plan\nStock Options\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we issued a total of 6,000,000 non-qualified stock options (the options) to directors, officers and certain key consultants. These options are subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Compensation Plan. All granted options are subject to a five-year vesting schedule equal to 20% per year starting on the 1st day of each year following the effective date. All options have an exercise price of $0.65 which was the closing price of our common stock on the day the day grant. The following table sets forth the number of non-qualified stock options, their exercise prices, vesting dates, and expiry dates.\nNumber of Options\nExercise Prices\nVesting Dates\nExpiry Dates\n1,200,000\n$0.65\nJanuary 1, 2023\n10 Years from date of grant\n1,200,000\n$0.65\nJanuary 1, 2024\n10 Years from date of grant\n1,200,000\n$0.65\nJanuary 1, 2025\n10 Years from date of grant\n1,200,000\n$0.65\nJanuary 1, 2026\n10 Years from date of grant\n1,200,000\n$0.65\nJanuary 1, 2027\n10 Years from date of grant\nPerformance Stock Units\nDuring the year ended June 30, 2022, we issued a total of 4,000,000 performance stock units (performance units) to directors, officers and certain key consultants. These performance units are subject to the terms and conditions of the Equity Compensation Plan. The performance units will be earned and vest upon reaching certain market capitalization goals during the performance period ending on December 31, 2026. The following table sets forth the number of performance stock units, their vesting conditions and expiry dates.\nNumber of Performance Units\nVesting Conditions\nExpiry Dates\n1,000,000\nMarket capitalization of the Company reaches $25 million\nDecember 31, 2026\n1,000,000\nMarket capitalization of the Company reaches $50 million\nDecember 31, 2026\n1,000,000\nMarket capitalization of the Company reaches $75 million\nDecember 31, 2026\n1,000,000\nMarket capitalization of the Company reaches $100 million\nDecember 31, 2026\nWarrants\nCommon Stock Purchase Warrants. As of November 10, 2022, there are an aggregate 5,014,026 outstanding Common Stock Purchase Warrants (Warrants), the terms of which are summarized below:\nExercisability. The outstanding Common Stock Purchase Warrants (Warrants) are exercisable immediately upon issuance. The warrants will be exercisable, at the option of each holder, in whole or in part, by delivering to us a duly executed exercise notice accompanied by payment in full for the number of shares of our common stock purchased upon such exercise (except in the case of a cashless exercise as discussed below). Unless otherwise specified in the warrant, the holder will not have the right to exercise any portion of the Warrant if the holder (together with its affiliates) would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the exercise (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of any warrants, 9.99%), as such percentage ownership is determined in accordance with the terms of the Warrants.\nCashless Exercise. In the event that a registration statement covering shares of common stock underlying the Warrants, is not available for the issuance of such shares of common stock underlying the Warrants, the holder may, in its sole discretion, exercise the warrant in whole or in part and, in lieu of making the cash payment otherwise contemplated to be made to us upon such exercise in payment of the aggregate exercise price, elect instead to receive upon such exercise the net number of shares of common stock determined according to the formula set forth in the warrant. In no event shall we be required to make any cash payments or net cash settlement to the registered holder in lieu of issuance of common stock underlying the Warrants.\nCertain Adjustments. The exercise price and the number of shares of common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specific events, including stock dividends, stock splits, combinations and reclassifications of our common stock, and dilutive issuances as defined in the Warrants.\nTransferability. Subject to applicable laws, the Warrants may be transferred at the option of the holders upon surrender of the Warrants to the Company together with the appropriate instruments of transfer.\nRights as a Stockholder. Except as otherwise provided in the Warrants or by virtue of such holders ownership of shares of our common stock, the holder of a warrant does not have the rights or privileges of a holder of our common stock, including any voting rights, until the holder exercises the warrant.\nBeneficial Ownership Limitation. Holders exercise shall be limited 4.99% of the Companys outstanding common stock (or, upon election by a Holder prior to the issuance of any Warrants, 9.99%) of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation provided that the beneficial ownership limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrant held by the Holder. Any increase in the beneficial ownership limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company.\nThe following table set forth the number of warrants, exercise prices and expiry dates\nNumber of Warrants\nExercise Price\nExpiry Date\n1,100,000\n$0.25\nDecember 28, 2022\n1,100,000\n$0.25\nMarch 25, 2023\n506,838\n$0.25\nApril 15, 2023\n307,408\n$0.25\nApril 28, 2023\n500,000\n$0.25\nJuly 12, 2027\n250,000\n$0.25\nJuly 15, 2027\n250,000\n$0.25\nJuly 18, 2027\n1,000,000\n$0.25\nOctober 13, 2027\nDividend Policy\nWe have never paid any cash dividends and intends, for the foreseeable future, to retain any future earnings for the development of our business. Our future dividend policy will be determined by the board of directors on the basis of various factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, capital requirements and investment opportunities.\nHolders\nAs of November 10, 2022, we have 27,316,337 issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock, which are held by approximately 400 shareholders of record.\nTransfer Agent and Registrar\nTego Cyber Inc. has appointed Signature Stock Transfer Inc. as its transfer agent. Signatures address is 14673 Midway Road, Suite #220, Addison, Texas, 75001. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and administrative functions in connection with the common shares.\nMarket Information\nOur common shares are currently quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol \"TGCB. The following table sets forth the range of the high and low sale prices of the common stock for the periods indicated. The quotations reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail markup, markdown or commission, and may not represent actual transactions. Consequently, the information provided below may not be indicative of our common stock price under different conditions.\nPeriod Ended\nHigh\nLow\nYear Ended June 30, 2022\nThrough June 30, 2022\n$0.80\n$0.53\nMarch 31, 2022\n$0.94\n$0.5301\nDecember 31, 2021\n$0.90\n$0.52\nSeptember 30, 2021\n$0.97\n$0.51\nYear Ended June 30, 2021 (1)\nJune 30, 2021\n$1.25\n$0.30\n(1)\nThe shares of our common stock were not approved for trading on the OTCQB until February 19, 2021. The first trade occurred on April 12, 2021, which is why there is limited historical trading data for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nAs of November 10 , 2022, the high and low sales price of our common stock was $1.25 per share and $0.2613 per share, respectively. As of November 10, 2022, there were 27,316,377 shares of common stock outstanding held by approximately 400 stockholders of record.\nTrades in our common stock may be subject to Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act, which imposes requirements on broker/dealers who sell securities subject to the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. For transactions covered by the rule, broker/dealers must make a special suitability determination for purchasers of the securities and receive the purchasers written agreement to the transaction before the sale.\nPenny Stock Regulation\nPenny stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 per share other than securities registered on national securities exchanges or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided that current price and volume information with respect to transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser's written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules, broker-dealers may be restricted in their ability to sell our common stock. The foregoing required penny stock restrictions will not apply to our common stock if such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share or greater.\nAdditional Information\nWe refer you to our Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, and the applicable provisions of the Nevada Revised Statues for a more complete description of the rights and liabilities of holders of our securities. Item 6. [Reserved]\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 7.

We have developed a cyber threat intelligence application that integrates with top end security platforms to gather, analyze, then proactively identify threats to an enterprise network. The Tego Guardian app takes in vetted and curated threat data and through a proprietary process compiles, analyzes, and delivers that data to an enterprise network in a format that is timely, informative and relevant. The first version of the Tego Guardian app integrates with the Splunk SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) platform. Splunk is a recognized industry leader in data analytics and has an established user base of over 22,000 enterprise clients including 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. The Tego Guardian app will be marketed as a value-add enhancement to an existing Splunk SIEM environment. Tego Guardian adds value by providing data enrichment: a detailed \u2018who, what, when and where of any potential cyberthreat within an enterprise network environment. Other similar applications identify that something is \u2018bad but do not provide any additional context, so it is up to the enterprises cybersecurity team to analyze the threat data to establish which threats need to be acted upon. It is then up to the enterprises cybersecurity team to analyze the threat data to establish which threats need to be acted upon. Tego Guardian automates this process thereby saving the enterprise time and money. The Tego Guardian app is now available to Splunk SIEM platform users via direct download through Splunks app store: Splunkbase. Tego Cyber plans to develop future versions of the Tego Guardian app for integration with other leading SIEM platforms including Elastic, Devo, IBM QRadar, AT&T Cybersecurity, Exabeam and Google Chronical. The goal is to have a version of the Tego Guardian available for integration with these SIEM platforms within the next two years.

These amounts consisted of the following:\nGeneral & administration\n$ 1,258,539\n$ 367,854\nProfessional fees\n749,607\n238,894\nSales & marketing\n171,211\n68,170\nShare-based compensation\n905,962\n-\nTotal operating expenses\n$ 3,085,319\n$ 674,918\nOverall operating expenses increased by $2,410,401 to $3,085,319 for the year ended June 30, 2022, as compared to $674,918 for the year ended June 30, 2021. General and administration increased by $890,739 as result of increased operational expenses due to the growth of the overall business and setting up of the infrastructure in preparation of full commercialization of the first version of the Tego Guardian. Professional fees increased by $510,713 as a result of being fully reporting with the SEC for one full year and the additional expenditures that go along with being a publicly traded company. Sales and marketing increased by $239,381 as a result of the initial commercialization of the first version of the Tego Guradian. Share-based compensation expense increased $905,962 as a result of the issuance of the non-qualified stock options and performance stock units. .\nNet Loss\nWe incurred a net loss of $3,147,901 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to a net loss of $923,180 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at June 30, 2022, we have a working capital surplus of $48,945, a net loss of $3,147,901 and have earned limited revenue to cover our operating costs. We have $47,742 cash on hand and our burn rate is approximately $150,000 per month. We intend to fund future operations through debt or equity financing arrangements. Our ability to realize our business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of our business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through debt, public or private placement offerings. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the cash flows used in our operating activities was $1,618,526 compared to $578,415 for the same period ended June 30, 2021. This amount was primarily related to a (i) net loss of $3,147,901; (ii) share based compensation of $905,962; and (iii) shares issued for services of $458,250\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the net cash used in investing activities by the Company was $341,949 compared to $54,250 for the same period ended June 30, 2021. The amount was related to the capitalization of software development costs of $335,372 and purchase of computer equipment of $6,577.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, the net cash provided by financing activities by the Company was $1,425,202 compared to $1,133,808 for the same period ended June 30, 2021. The cash provided by financing activities is related to the proceeds received from sales of our common stock.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.\nFuture Financings\nWe will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares and debt proceeds in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities.\nExpected Purchase or Sale of Significant Equipment\nWe do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any significant equipment, as such items are not required by us at this time or in the next twelve months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to US GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared to present the balance sheets the statements of operations, statements of changes in shareholders equity and cash flows of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. During the fiscal periods ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, substantially all of the Companys cash was held by major financial institutions located in the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company extended credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition. The Company generally did not require collateral for accounts receivable and maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of accounts receivable if necessary.\nCash\nCash consists of cash held at major financial institutions and is subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value and do not bear interest. No allowance for doubtful accounts was made during the period ended June 30, 2021, based on managements best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. The Company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon knowledge of its customers and their compliance with credit terms. The evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis. The review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding for more than 60 days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible. As of June 30, 2022, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts and the Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, adopted January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The Companys financial instruments include cash, current receivables and payables. These financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nFor cash, accounts receivables, subscription receivables, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, it is managements opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable, their stated interest rate approximates current rates available.\nManagement believes it is not practical to estimate the fair value of related party receivables and payables because the transactions cannot be assumed to have been consummated at arms length, the terms are not deemed to be market terms, there are no quoted values available for these instruments, and an independent valuation would not be practical due to the lack of data regarding similar instruments, if any, and the associated potential costs.\nRevenue Recognition\nAccounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), was adopted by the Company as of September 6, 2019. The Companys revenue recognition disclosure reflects its updated accounting policies that are affected by this new standard. The Company applied the modified retrospective transition method for open contracts for the implementation of Topic 606. As revenues are and have been primarily from consulting and management services, and the Company has no significant post-delivery obligations, this new standard did not result in a material recognition of revenue on the Companys accompanying financial statements for the cumulative impact of applying this new standard. The Company made no adjustments to its previously reported total revenues, as those periods continue to be presented in accordance with its historical accounting practices under Topic 605, Revenue Recognition.\nRevenue from providing consulting and management services under Topic 606 is recognized in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of services to customers in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements:\n-\nexecuted contracts with the Companys customers that it believes are legally enforceable;\n-\nidentification of performance obligations in the respective contract;\n-\ndetermination of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract;\n-\nallocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and\n-\nrecognition of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation.\nThese five elements as applied to the Companys consulting and management services results in revenue recorded as services are provided.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed similar to basic earnings per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. The Company had no dilutive securities for the periods ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued ASU 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting, to include share-based payment transactions for acquiring goods and services from nonemployees. ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for nonemployee share-based payments, aligning it more closely with the accounting for employee awards.\nOther recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force) did not or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's present or future financial statements.\nItem 7.A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.

are an integral part of these audited financial statements\nNOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nTego Cyber Inc. (the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 6, 2019. It was created to capitalize on the emerging cyber threat intelligence market and has developed a state-of-the-art cyber threat intelligence application that enriches threat data to help enterprises identify cyber threats within their environments. Tego Guardian is a proactive intelligent cyberthreat hunting tool that gives enterprises the ability to quickly track threats throughout their networks, mapping out exposures and expediting remediation. Tego Guardian integrates with the widely used Splunk Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform. Tego Guardian is a Splunk approved app and available for download through Splunks marketplace. The Company plans on developing future versions of Tego Guardian for integration with other established SIEM systems and platforms including: Elastic, IBM QRadar, AT&T AlienVault, Exabeam, and Google Chronical.\nThe Companys head office is at 8565 S. Eastern Ave. #150, Las Vegas, Nevada, 89123.\nNOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP). In the opinion of management, the financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair statement of the results for the period presented.\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared to present the balance sheets, the statements of operations, statements of changes in shareholders equity and the statements of cash flows of the Company for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021. The accompanying audited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP using Company-specific information where available and allocations and estimates where data is not maintained on a Company-specific basis within its books and records. Due to the allocations and estimates used to prepare the financial statements, they may not reflect the financial position, cash flows and results of operations of the Company in the future or its operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of the Companys financial statements; accordingly, it is possible that the actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material effect on the reported amounts of the Companys financial position and results of operations.\nNOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of the business. The Company has incurred material losses from operations and has an accumulated deficit. At June 30, 2022, the Company had a working capital surplus of $48,945. For the year ended June 30, 2022, the Company sustained net losses and generated negative cash flows from operations. In March 2020, the World Health Organization recognized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and government actions implemented to contain the further spread of COVID-19 have severely restricted economic activity around the world. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Companys ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. These adjustments could be material. The Companys continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to earn adequate revenues from operations and to obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such financings or obtain them on favorable terms.\nNOTE 4 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThis summary of significant accounting policies is presented to assist in understanding the financial statements. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Companys management, who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to US GAAP and have been consistently applied in the preparation of the financial statements.\nBasis of Preparation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared to present the balance sheets, the statements of operations, statements of changes in shareholders equity and statements of cash flows of the Company for the period ended June 30, 2022 and 2021 and have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. As at June 30, 2022, substantially all of the Companys cash was held by major financial institutions located in the United States, which management believes are of high credit quality. With respect to accounts receivable, the Company extended credit based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition. The Company generally did not require collateral for accounts receivable and maintained an allowance for doubtful accounts of accounts receivable if necessary.\nCash\nCash consists of cash held at major financial institutions and is subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.\nReceivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value and do not bear interest. No allowance for doubtful accounts was made during the period ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, based on managements best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in accounts receivable. The Company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon knowledge of its customers and their compliance with credit terms. The evaluation process includes a review of customers accounts on a regular basis. The review process evaluates all account balances with amounts outstanding for more than 60 days and other specific amounts for which information obtained indicates that the balance may be uncollectible. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts and the Company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.\nSoftware\nSoftware is stated at cost less accumulated amortization and is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The estimated useful life of the asset is 5 years and is not depreciated until it is available for use by the Company.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating and financing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are included on the balance sheet. Right-of-use assets represent the Companys right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Companys obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate, based on the information available at the commencement date, in determining the present value of future lease payments. Right-of-use assets include any prepaid lease payments and exclude any lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Operating lease expenses are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, consisting of interest accrued on the lease liability and depreciation of the right-of-use asset. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease is it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise that option. The Company leases its corporate office located at 8565 S. Eastern Ave. #150, Las Vegas, Nevada. The initial lease term is for 12 months commencing on September 8, 2019 after which the term is on a month-to-month basis. After the initial term, the Company may cancel the lease agreement at any time by providing 30 days written notice. The Company has elected the short-term lease practical expedient of 12 months and has not recorded a lease.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, adopted January 1, 2008, defines fair value, establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The Companys financial instruments include cash, current receivables and payables. These financial instruments are measured at their respective fair values. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.\nFor cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities and due to related parties, it is managements opinion that the carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and if applicable, their stated interest rate approximates current rates available.\nFor convertible debts, the carrying values, excluding any unamortized discounts, approximate the respective fair value. There are no convertible debt at June 30, 2022. The convertible debts have been discounted to reflect their net present value as at June 30, 2021. The carrying values of embedded conversion features not considered to be derivative instruments were determined by allocating the remaining carrying value of the convertible debt after deducting the estimated carrying value of the liability portion.\nEstimating fair value for warrants require determining the most appropriate valuation model which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant. This estimate requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the warrant, volatility, dividend yield, and rate of forfeitures and making assumptions about them.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers using the modified retrospective method. Under this method, the Company follows the five-step model provided by ASC Topic 606 in order to recognize revenue in the following manner: 1) identify the contract; 2) identify the performance obligations of the contract; 3) determine the transaction price of the contract; 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations; and 5) recognize revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\nRevenue for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021 consisted of the following:\nJune 30,\nJune 30,\nConsulting fees\n$ 1,050\n$ 5,600\nSubscription revenue\n2,500\n2,500\nTotal\n$ 3,550\n$ 8,100\nThe Company currently has not generated any revenue from its threat intelligence software.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes pursuant to ASC 740 Income Taxes. ASC 740 requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes and allows recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The provision for income taxes represents current taxes payable net of the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nEarnings (Loss) per Share\nBasic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed similar to basic earnings (loss) per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potential common shares had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. If applicable, diluted earnings (loss) per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings (loss) per share. The Company had no dilutive securities for the year ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes which amends ASC 740 Income Taxes (ASC 740). This update is intended to simplify accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and amending existing guidance to improve consistent application of ASC 740. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. The guidance in this update has various elements, some of which are applied on a prospective basis and others on a retrospective basis with earlier application permitted. The Companys management is currently evaluating the effect of this ASU on the Companys financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn June 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-05 in response to the ongoing impacts to U.S. businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ASU 2020-05, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Leases (Topic 842) Effective Dates for Certain Entities provide a limited deferral of the effective dates for implementing previously issued ASU 606 and ASU 842 to give some relief to businesses considering the difficulties they are facing during the pandemic. These entities may defer application to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. As the Company has already adopted ASU 606 and ASU 842, the Company does not anticipate any effect on its financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)-Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entitys Own Equity. ASU 2020-06 reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock. For convertible instruments with conversion features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital, the embedded conversion features no longer are separated from the host contract. ASU 2020-06 also removes certain conditions that should be considered in the derivatives scope exception evaluation under Subtopic 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity, and clarify the scope and certain requirements under Subtopic 815-40. In addition, ASU 2020-06 improves the guidance related to the disclosures and earnings-per-share (EPS) for convertible instruments and contract in entitys own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for public business entities that meet the definition of a SEC filer, excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nOn August 23, 2022, we received notice of resignation from Harbourside CPA, LLP (Harbourside), as our registered independent registered public accountant. The resignation from Harbourside is the result of their decision to cease operations. We appointed BF Borgers CPA PC (\"Borgers\") as our registered independent public accounting firm as of August 24, 2022. The decisions to appoint Borgers was approved by our Board of Directors on August 24, 2022.\nDisagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nOther than the disclosure of uncertainty regarding the ability for us to continue as a going concern which was included in our accountants report on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021; Harbouside CPAs report on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles.\nIn connection with the audit and review of our financial statements from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, there were no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosures, or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would have caused them to make reference in connection with Borgerss opinion to the subject matter of the disagreement.\nIn connection with the audited financial statements of the Company for the fiscal year June 30, 2022, there have been no reportable events with the Company as set forth in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.\nItem 9.A Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers concluded as of June 30, 2022 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting discussed immediately below.\nIdentified Material Weakness\nA material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected.\nManagement identified the following material weakness during its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting, which are primarily due to the size of the Company and available resources:\nPersonnel: We do not employ a full time Chief Financial Officer. We utilize a consultant to assist with our financial reporting. There are limited personnel to assist with the accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the year ended June 30, 2022, in accordance with GAAP. During 2022-2023, the Company intends to seek qualified accounting staff to expand its internal accounting and reporting functions.\nAudit Committee: We do not yet have an audit committee, and we lack a financial expert. During 2022-2023, the Board expects to appoint an Audit Committee and to identify a committee Chairman who is an audit committee financial expert as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and as adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our CEO and CFO, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorization of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that the Companys internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2022.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the control systems objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their cost.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, which were identified in connection with our managements evaluation required by paragraph (d) of rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe are not required by current SEC rules to include an auditor's attestation report. Our registered public accounting firm has not attested to Management's reports on our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Internal Controls\nOur management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.\nThe design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving our stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nItem 9.B Other Information\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, we completed various private placements whereby a total of 5,558,810 common shares were issued for a total of $1,425,202 cash. We also issued 715,572 common shares for services valued at $458,250. We also issued 937,151 common shares in settlement of convertible debt valued at $93,715.\nItem 9.C Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdiction the Prevent Inspection\nNot applicable.\nPART III   Item 10.

These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. At this time, our President and Chief Executive Officer is devoted full time to our operations and devotes approximately 40-50 hours per week.

Mrs. Shannon Wilkinson, Mr. Troy Wilkinson, Mr. Michael De Valera and Mr. Chris White. Mrs. Wilkinson and Mr. White do not qualify as an independent Directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market as they hold officer positions. Mr. Wilkinson does not qualify as an independent Directors in accordance with the published listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market as he is married to Mrs. Wilkinson. Mr. Michael De Valera does qualify as independent director as he is not an officer of our company. The NASDAQ independence definition includes a series of objective tests, such as that the Director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of the companys employees and that neither the Director, nor any of his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, the Board of Directors has not made a subjective determination as to each Director that no relationships exist which, in the opinion of the Board of Directors, would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a Director, though such subjective determination is required by the NASDAQ rules. Had the Board of Directors made these determinations, the Board of Directors would have reviewed and discussed information provided by the Directors and the Company with regard to each Directors business and personal activities and relationships as they may relate to the Company and its management\nCommittees\nWe do not currently have an audit, compensation or nominating committee. The Board of Directors as a whole currently acts as our audit, compensation and nominating committees. We intend to establish an audit, compensation and nominating committee of our Board of Directors once we expand the Board to include one or more independent directors and intend to adopt a charter for each committee.\nOur audit committee shall be primarily responsible for reviewing the services performed by our independent auditors, evaluating our accounting policies and our system of internal controls. Our compensation committee shall assist the Board in reviewing and approving the compensation structure, including all forms of compensation, relating to our directors and executive officers and periodically reviewing and approving any long-term incentive compensation or equity plans, programs or similar arrangements. Our nominating committee shall assist the Board in selecting individuals qualified to become our directors and in determining the composition of the Board and its committees.\nCompliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act\nSection 16(a) of the Exchange Act requires the Companys directors, executive officers and persons who beneficially own 10% or more of a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act to file reports of beneficial ownership and changes in beneficial ownership with the SEC. Directors, executive officers and greater than 10% stockholders are required by the rules and regulations of the SEC to furnish the Company with copies of all reports filed by them in compliance with Section 16(a). To the Companys knowledge, based solely on a review of reports furnished to it, for the year ended June 30, 2022, all of the Companys officers, directors and ten percent holders have made the required filings other than one Form 3 filing regarding the initial statement of beneficial ownership of Earl Johnson which was filed late.\nRisk Oversight\nEffective risk oversight is an important priority of the Board of Directors. Because risks are considered in virtually every business decision, the Board of Directors discusses risk throughout the year generally or in connection with specific proposed actions. The Board of Directors approach to risk oversight includes understanding the critical risks in our business and strategy, evaluating our risk management processes, allocating responsibilities for risk oversight among the full Board of Directors, and fostering an appropriate culture of integrity and compliance with legal responsibilities.\nCorporate Governance\nWe promote accountability for adherence to honest and ethical conduct; endeavors to provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that we file with the SEC and in other public communications made; and we strive to be compliant with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations. We have not yet formally adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics that govern our employees, officers and Directors as we are not currently required to do so.\nIn lieu of an Audit Committee, our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing and making recommendations concerning the selection of outside auditors, reviewing the scope, results and effectiveness of the annual audit of our financial statements and other services provided by our independent public accountants. The Board of Directors reviews our internal accounting controls, practices and policies.\nCode of Ethics\nOur Board of Directors has not adopted a code of ethics. We anticipate that we will adopt a code of ethics when we increase either the number of our Directors or the number of our employees. Item 11.
