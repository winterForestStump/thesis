    "content": "Item 1. Description of Business.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc. a/k/a Homeland Resources Ltd. (Himalaya, HMLA, us, we, the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Companys principal historical activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, the Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude oil and natural gas properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2019. Over the past few years, the company generated approximately $1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to July 31, 2022 the Company reached an agreement with the prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder. Our intended plan of operations is to develop and enhance our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness in the cannabis media market supplemented by strategic acquisitions and investments in GenBio, Inc. and other potential to be determined opportunities. On June 28, 2021 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Himalaya Technologies, Inc. from Homeland Resources Ltd.\nOur business plan includes completing our social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness focused on the cannabis market, generating revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing our planned 19.9% investment GenBio, Inc.s health and wellness products targeting anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals to consumers. In the future, in partnership with GenBio, Inc., we plan to introduce a health and wellness energy and anti-inflammatory beverage product under the brand FOMO or other to drive growth. We are currently in preliminary discussions with co-pack and distribution companies, and GenBio, Inc. is formulating its extracts and obtaining laboratory certification for this planned consumer beverage, though there can be no assurance of a successful product formulation or distribution.\nThe Company has one wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP. The Company has two investments, GenBio, Inc. and The Agrarian Group, LLC. The Company owns 19.9% of GenBio, Inc. and 19.9% of The Agrarian Group, LLC.\nKANAB CORP. is a development stage company targeting information services for the cannabis industry using its social site Kanab.Club (https://kanab.club/). We do not offer e-commerce services at this time or touch the cannabis plant and, given these matters, do not believe regulatory oversight or rules of law are a risk factor to our business.\nOn November 28, 2021 we executed a 19.9% stock purchase with GenBio, Inc. (GenBio; https://www.genbioinc.com/) a provider of nutraceutical products and services based on proprietary biotechnology that fight inflammation and high blood pressure. We issued 99,686 series B Preferred shares of stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9% ownership. Based on a stock price at closing of .0019 and 99,685,794 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $189,749. The GenBio transaction is being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate GenBios financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company executed a 19.9% stock purchase with The Agrarian Group LLC (TAG; http://www.theagrariangroup.com/), a provider of digital intelligence AgtechDi software designed from its granted patents to optimize the food supply chain by increasing food safety and profitability for growers who operate vertical farms, greenhouses, converted shipping containers, and other forms of controlled environment agriculture. TAG is focusing its technology on the broad produce market, but in the future may offer it to cannabis cultivators. TAG is a software platform and will never touch the cannabis plant, eliminating regulatory risk, in our view. Under the Investment Agreement, we issued TAG 99,686 Series B Preferred shares in exchange for 1,242,000 Class A Membership units of TAG. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,868,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $119,841. The TAG transaction is being accounted for as an investment on our balance sheet. We will not consolidate TAGs financial statements.\nThe Companys shareholder voting control is effectively controlled by its chairman and CEO, Vikram P. Grover, due to his ownership of (i) all 1,000,000 of the outstanding shares of the Companys Series C Preferred Stock which has voting power of 100,000 votes per share and (ii) 174,594 shares of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock directly (31.9% of that classs outstanding shares) and 150,000 shares of the Companys Series B Preferred Stock indirectly through a Company he controls (27.4%) which have 1,000 votes per share. With this voting power, Mr. Grover, can determine the outcome of any matter put to a shareholder vote including taking corporate actions by shareholder consent.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in the State of Nevada in 2003. Our principal executive offices are located at 1 E Erie St, Ste 525 Unit #2420, Chicago, IL 60611 and our telephone number is (630) 708-0750. Our website is www.himalayatechnologies.com.

Market for Registrants Common Equity Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nMarket Information\nOur shares of common stock are quoted on the OTCPink tier of the over-the-counter market operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. under the symbol HMLA. Such market is extremely limited. We can provide no assurance that our shares of common stock will be continued to be traded on the OTCPink or another exchange, or if traded, that the current public market will be sustainable.\nHolders of Record\nAs of the date of this Annual Report, there were approximately 34 holders of record of our common stock, as reported by the Companys transfer agent. In computing the number of holders of record, each broker-dealer and clearing corporation holding shares on behalf of its customers is counted as a single shareholder and accordingly, the Company believes that the number of beneficial owners of its common stock is significantly higher.\nDividends\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock, nor do we anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future.

(the Company) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on July 8, 2003. The Companys principal historical activities had been the acquisition of a mineral property in the State of New Mexico. During the fiscal year ended July 31, 2010, the Company began to acquire working interests in a seismic exploration program as well as a drilling program in crude oil and natural gas properties in Oklahoma. Prior to July 31, 2019 the Company discontinued the exploration and drilling in Oklahoma and New Mexico. The Company has leases on two properties that were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2021. Over the past few years, the company generated approximately $1,500 per year of net revenue from these leases. Subsequent to July 31, 2022 the Company reached an agreement with the Companys prior CEO to distribute the oil leases in payment of loan from shareholder.\nOn June 28, 2021 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to Himalaya Technologies, Inc. from Homeland Resources Ltd.\nThe Companys business plan includes completing its social site Kanab.Club targeting health and wellness based on the cannabis market, generating revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing its 19.9% investment GenBio, Inc.s health and wellness products targeting anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals to consumers. Additionally, the Company intends to pursue growth of its 19.9% minority investment in agriculture technology provider The Agrarian Group, LLC (TAG).\nNote 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements were prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (US GAAP) and in conformity with the rules and regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include accounts payable, the recoverability of long-term assets, and the valuation of derivative liabilities.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts and operations of the Company, and its wholly owned subsidiary, KANAB CORP., which was acquired on July 31, 2021. All material inter-company transactions and accounts have been eliminated in the consolidation.\nCash\nCash consists of deposits in two large national banks. On July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company had $4,141 and $28,618 in cash in the United States. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risks on its cash in bank accounts.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nFor certain of the Companys financial instruments, including cash accounts payable, accrued liabilities, short-term debt, and derivative liability, the carrying amounts approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. We adopted ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,, which requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments held by the Company. ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, defines fair value, and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement that enhances disclosure requirements for fair value measures. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for receivables and current liabilities each qualify as financial instruments and are a reasonable estimate of their fair values because of the short period of time between the origination of such instruments and their expected realization and their current market rate of interest. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3 measurements). The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 input to the valuation methodology are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions, such as valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThe Companys analyses of all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity, and ASC 815.\nThe Company has recorded the conversion option on notes as a derivative liability because of the variable conversion price, which in accordance with U.S. GAAP, prevents them from being considered as indexed to our stock and qualified for an exception to derivative accounting.\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the accompanying balance sheets at fair value. We record changes in the fair value of the derivatives in the accompanying statement of operations.\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows as of July 31, 2022:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nTotal assets measured at fair value - - - -\nLiabilities\nDerivative liability 440,766 - - 440,766\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value 440,766 - - 440,766\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows as of July 31, 2021:\nTotal Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\nAssets\nTotal assets measured at fair value\n- - - -\nLiabilities\nDerivative liability 551,892 - - 551,892\nTotal liabilities measured at fair value 551,892 - - 551,892\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nEarnings Per Share (EPS)\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted EPS assumes that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible preferred shares. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. Under the if-converted method, convertible outstanding instruments are assumed to be converted into common stock at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later). During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company generated no revenues and incurred substantial losses, of which the vast majority were due to mostly non-cash charges for accrued interest, penalties and derivative charges related to convertible debt instruments. Therefore, the effect of any common stock equivalents on EPS is anti-dilutive during those periods.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company utilizes FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 740, Income Taxes, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that were included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each period end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nASC 740 provides accounting and disclosure guidance about positions taken by an organization in its tax returns that might be uncertain. When tax returns are filed, it is likely that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest associated with unrecognized tax benefits is classified as interest expense and penalties are classified in selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of income.\nOn July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had not taken any significant uncertain tax positions on its tax returns for the period ended July 31, 2022 and prior years or in computing its tax provisions for any years. Prior management considered its tax positions and believed that all of the positions taken by the Company in its Federal and State tax returns were more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The Company is subject to examination by U.S. Federal and State tax authorities from inception to present, generally for three years after they are filed. New management, which took control of the Company on June 21, 2021, is currently evaluating prior managements decision to not file federal tax returns and plans on filing past returns and related 1099 filings for compensation paid to prior management, employees, consultants, contractors and affiliates. The Company does not believe it has a material tax liability due to its operating losses in these periods but is preparing tax filings to bring itself current as it completes and moves forward on announced mergers and acquisitions.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nCash is mainly maintained by one highly qualified institution in the United States. At various times, such amounts are more than federally insured limits. Management does not believe that the Company is subject to any unusual financial risk beyond the normal risk associated with commercial banking relationships. The Company has not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe Company is subject to risks from, among other things, competition associated with the industry in general, other risks associated with financing, liquidity requirements, rapidly changing customer requirements, limited operating history and the volatility of public markets.\nCrude Oil and Natural Gas Properties\nThe Company follows the full cost accounting method to account for crude oil and natural gas properties, whereby costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of crude oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized. Such costs include lease acquisition, geological and geophysical activities, rentals on non-producing leases, drilling, completing and equipping of crude oil and natural gas wells and administrative costs directly attributable to those activities and asset retirement costs. Disposition of crude oil and natural gas properties are accounted for as a reduction of capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless, such adjustment would significantly alter the relationship between capital costs and proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas, in which case the gain or loss is recognized to income.\nThe capitalized costs of crude oil and natural gas properties, excluding unevaluated and unproved properties, are amortized using the units-of-production method based on estimated proved recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves. Amortization of unevaluated and unproved property costs begins when the properties become proved or their values become impaired. Impairment of unevaluated and unproved prospects is assessed periodically based on a variety of factors, including managements intention with regard to future exploration and development of individually significant properties and the ability of the Company to obtain funds to finance such exploration and development.\nUnder full cost accounting rules for each cost center, capitalized costs of evaluated crude oil and natural gas properties, including asset retirement costs, less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes, may not exceed an amount (the cost ceiling) equal to the sum of (a) the present value of future net cash flows from estimated production of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, based on current economic and operating conditions, discounted at 10%, plus (b) the cost of properties not being amortized, plus (c) the lower of cost or estimated fair value of any unproved properties included in the costs being amortized, less (d) any income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties involved. If capitalized costs exceed this limit, the excess is charged to earnings.\nGiven the volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term. If crude oil and natural gas prices decline in the future, even if only for a short period of time, it is possible that additional impairments of crude oil and natural gas properties could occur. In addition, it is reasonably possible that additional impairments could occur if costs are incurred in excess of any increases in the present value of future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves, or if properties are sold for proceeds less than the discounted present value of the related proved crude oil and natural gas reserves.\nThe crude oil and gas properties were fully depleted prior to July 31, 2019.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenues in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 - Contracts with Customers. Revenue from sales of products is recognized when the related performance obligation is satisfied. The Companys performance obligation is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to customers.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for all stock-based compensation using a fair value-based method. The fair value of equity-classified awards granted to employees is estimated on the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and the related stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Companys intangible assets include the Kanab.Club website, which was developed for external use. The Company carries these intangibles at cost, less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives, estimated to be 5 years. Costs that are incurred to produce the finished product after technological feasibility has been established are capitalized as an intangible asset. The company performs periodic reviews to ensure that unamortized program costs remain recoverable from future revenue.\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe Company initially records goodwill and other acquired intangible assets at their estimated fair values and reviews these assets periodically for impairment. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination and is tested at least annually for impairment, historically during our fourth quarter.\nDerivative Liabilities\nThe Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of July 31, 2022 and 2021, which consist of convertible instruments and warrants in the Companys common stock and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.\nASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free-standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.\nThe Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance sheet thereafter and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument, the expected volatility, the implied risk-free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate, if any.\nEarnings Per Share (EPS)\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed similar to basic net income per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if all the potential common shares, warrants and stock options had been issued and if the additional common shares were dilutive. Diluted EPS assumes that all dilutive convertible shares and stock options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method for the outstanding options and the if-converted method for the outstanding convertible preferred shares. Under the treasury stock method, options and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period. The effect of any common stock equivalents on EPS is anti-dilutive during the years ended July 31, 2021 and 2022.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued the update Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the estimation of credit losses from an incurred loss methodology to one that reflects expected credit losses (the Current Expected Credit Loss model, or CECL) which requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. Measurement under CECL is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability of reported amounts. The amendments in the update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company continues to evaluate the impact, if any, the implementation of the CECL model will have on our financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) - Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts on an Entitys Own Equity. The ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. Consequently, more convertible debt instruments will be reported as a single liability instrument with no separate accounting for embedded conversion features. The ASU removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, which will permit more equity contracts to qualify for the exceptions. The ASU also simplifies the diluted net income per share calculation in certain areas. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entitys Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40). The new ASU addresses issuers accounting for certain modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options. This amendment is effective for all entities, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of the standard on the consolidated financial statements.\nNote 3 - GOING CONCERN\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company reported an accumulated deficit of $8,059,476 as of July 31, 2022. The Company also had negative working capital of $1,016,603 on July 31, 2022 and had operating losses of $285,731 and $44,717 for the years ended July 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. To date, these losses and deficiencies have been financed principally through the issuance of common stock, loans from related parties and loans from third parties.\nIn view of the matters described, there is substantial doubt as to the Companys ability to continue as a going concern without a significant infusion of capital. We anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months. To the extent that we are required to raise additional funds to acquire properties, and to cover costs of operations, we intend to do so through additional offerings of debt or equity securities. There are no commitments or arrangements for other offerings in place, no guaranties that any such financings would be forthcoming, or as to the terms of any such financings. Any future financing may involve substantial dilution to existing investors.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nNote 4 - ACQUISITION OF KANAB CORP.\nOn July 31, 2021, the Company acquired 100% interest in KANAB CORP., a cannabis information services company operating a website Kanab.Club (https://www.kanab.club/). KANAB CORP.s business plan includes completing its social site targeting health and wellness products and services in the cannabis market, generating revenues from advertising and subscriptions, incorporating social media site into the site, and marketing health and wellness products targeting consumers. KANAB CORP. is a development stage company that does not offer e-commerce services at this time, nor do we touch the cannabis plant and, given these matters, do not believe regulatory oversight or rules of law are a risk factor to the business. As consideration for the purchase, we issued 300,000 shares of Class B preferred stock. As KANAB CORP. was acquired from the Companys Chief Executive Officer and a company controlled by the Companys Chief Executive Office, the Company has accounted for the acquisition as an acquisition under common control, recorded at cost. The historical value of the development costs at acquisition for the website design was $11,500. As an acquisition under common control, the results of operations for KANAB CORP. are included in the consolidated results of operations for the year ended July 31, 2021. Although KANAB CORP. has not generated any revenues, it has developed a website that is currently active and generating traffic. Subsequent to the acquisition, additional expenses were incurred in further enhancing the Kanab.Club website.\nThe following summarizes the acquired intangible assets:\nSCHEDULE OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nJuly 31, July 31,\nIntangible assets $ 17,800 $ 11,500\nAccumulated amortization (4,462 ) (914 )\nIntangible assets- net $ 13,338 $ 10,586\nNote 5 - INVESTMENTS\nOn November 28, 2021 the Company issued 99,686 series B preferred shares of stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9% ownership. GenBio, Inc is a biotechnology company that researches natural products that act on new molecular pathways, primarily to suppress inflammation at critical points in these biochemical pathways. Based on a stock price at closing of .0019 and 99,686,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $189,749. The GenBio transaction is being accounted for as an investment on the Companys balance sheet. The Company does not consolidate GenBios financial statements.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company issued 99,686 series B preferred shares of HMLA stock for 1,242,000 Member Interests of The Agrarian Group, LLC (TAG) representing 19.9% ownership. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,686,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $119,841. The TAG transaction is being accounted for as an investment on the Companys balance sheet. We do not consolidate TAGs financial statements.\nNote 6 - LOANS PAYABLE DUE TO RELATED PARTIES\nAs of July 31, 2022 and 2021, the Companys former chief executive officer had an outstanding balance of $96,400 and $97,000, respectively. The loan is non-interest bearing and due on demand. The loan has been retired subsequent to July 31, 2022 through the sale of our oil and gas interests to the note holder.\nNote 7 - CONVERTIBLE NOTE PAYABLES\nThe Company had convertible note payables with two third parties with stated interest rates ranging between 10% and 12% and 22% default interest not including penalties. These notes have a conversion feature such that the Company could not ensure it would have adequate authorized shares to meet all possible conversion demands; accordingly, the conversion option has been treated as a derivative liability in the accompanying interim financial statements. As of July 31, 2021, the Company had the following third-party convertible notes outstanding:\nSCHEDULE OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES OUTSTANDING\nLender Origination Maturity July 31, 2022 July 31, 2021 Interest\nKBM Worldwide Inc 9/8/14 6/12/15 $ - $ 32,149 22 %\nKBM Worldwide Inc. 12/29/14 10/1/15 - 95,848 22 %\nGS Capital 6/29/21 6/29/22 151,500 151,500 24 %\n151,500 279,497\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nThe convertible note for GS Capital converts at a price of 60% of the lowest trading price for the twenty (20) days prior to and including the date of notice of conversion. The number of shares that the loan can be converted into depends on the trading price at the time of conversion. At July 31, 2022 the note theoretically would convert into 36,594,203 common shares.\nThe notes for KBM Worldwide converted at a price of 61% of the average of the lowest five trading price for the last ten (10) trading days ending on the latest trading date prior to date of conversion to and including the date of notice of conversion. The number of shares that the loan can be converted into depends on the trading price at the time of conversion. As of July 31, 2022, the KBM notes have been fully retired.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, third-party lenders converted $127,997 of principal and interest into 49,466,978 shares of common stock.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, third-party lenders converted $232,057 of principal and interest into 22,187,901 shares of common stock.\nThe variables used for the Black-Scholes model are as listed below:\nSCHEDULE OF FAIR VALUE ASSUMPTION OF BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL\nJuly 31,2022\nJuly 31, 2021\n\u25cf Volatility: 355%\nVolatility: 253% - 466%\n\u25cf Risk free rate of return: 2.98%\nRisk free rate of return: 1.24%- 1.53%\n\u25cf Expected term: 1 year\nExpected term: 1-3 years\nOn June 29, 2021, a third-party loaned the Company $151,500 in a 10% debenture that matures on June 29, 2022. The transaction netted the Company $125,000.00 after legal fees and due diligence expenses. The third party was also issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock as a loan incentive. Of the $125,000 proceeds, $93,899 was used to settle $391,196 of third-party debt resulting in debt settlement income of $297,297.\nNote 8 - INCOME TAXES\nThe Company did not file its federal tax returns for fiscal years from 2012 through 2022. Management at year-end 2022 believed that it should not have any material impact on the Companys financials because the Company did not have any tax liabilities due to net loss incurred during these years.\nBased on the available information and other factors, management believes it is more likely than not that any potential net deferred tax assets on July 31, 2022 and 2021 will not be fully realizable.\nNote 9 - STOCKHOLDERS \u2018EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company increased the authorized shares for common stock of the Company from 100,000,000 to 1,000,000,000.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, third-party lenders converted $232,057 of principal and interest into 22,187,901 shares of common stock.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, third-party lenders converted $127,997 of principal and interest into 49,466,978 shares of common stock.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nPreferred Stock\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2021, the Company increased the authorized shares for preferred stock of the Company from 10,000,000 to 250,000,000. The preferred shares are in three classes:\n\u25cf Class A shares which, 130,000,000 authorized are convertible into 50 shares of common shares for each share, these shares have voting rights of 1 vote per share. At July 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 0 shares issued and outstanding.\n\u25cf Class B shares, 20,000,000 authorized, which are convertible into 1,000 shares of common shares for each share, these shares have voting rights of 1,000 votes per share. At July 31, 2022 and 2021, there were 536,876 and 300,000 shares issued and outstanding which equates into 536,876,000 and 300,000,000 votes, respectively.\n\u25cf Class C shares, 1,000,000 authorized, which are convertible into 1 share of common shares for each share. These shares have voting rights of 100,000 votes per share. At July 31, 2022 and 2021 there were 1,000,000 shares outstanding which equates into 100,000,000,000 votes. These shares represent the controlling votes of the Company. These shares are all issued to the Company CEO. There are 99,000,000 shares of preferred shares authorized that have not been assigned a class at this time for future requirements.\nOn July 31, 2021 the Company issued 300,000 shares of Class B Preferred for the acquisition of KANAB CORP. at $0.04 per share.\nOn July 31, 2021 the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of Class C preferred to the Companys CEO at $0.0001 per share.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company issued 22,000 shares of Class B Preferred for services. These shares were valued at the value of the as-if converted common shares on the date of issuance.\nDuring the year ended July 31, 2022, the Company issued 15,504 shares of Class B Preferred to the Companys CEO for the conversion of accrued compensation of $80,000.\nOn November 28, 2021 the Company issued 99,686 series B preferred shares of its stock for 2,036,188 common shares of GenBio, Inc., representing 19.9% ownership. GenBio, Inc is a biotechnology company that researches natural products that act on new molecular pathways, primarily to suppress inflammation at critical points in these biochemical pathways. Based on a stock price at closing of .0019 and 99,686,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $189,749.\nOn January 1, 2022, the Company issued 99,686 series B preferred shares of its stock for 1,242,000 Member Interests of The Agrarian Group, LLC (TAG) representing 19.9% ownership. Based on a stock price at closing of .0012 and 99,686,000 common stock equivalents, this values the investment at $119,841.\nWarrants\nOn June 29, 2021, the Company issued 15,000,000 warrants as to GS Capital Group as part of the convertible debenture financing to fund operations. These warrants have a three-year expiration and a strike price of $0.01\nOn June 28, 2021, the Company issued 50,000,000 warrants with a five-year expiration and $.0001 exercise price to FOMO Advisors LLC for future advisory services.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model that uses the assumptions noted in the table below. Since Black-Scholes option valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs, those ranges are disclosed. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Companys stock. The Company uses historical data to estimate award exercise and employee termination within the valuation model, whereby separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of granted awards is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the period of time that granted awards are expected to be outstanding; the range given below results from certain groups of employees exhibiting different behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nHimalaya Technologies, Inc.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nJULY 31, 2022 AND 2021\nThese FOMO Advisors LLC warrants were valued at $450,000 and are being recognized over the life of the agreement.

The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected the companys financial performance in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2020 and could have an impact throughout fiscal year 2021. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, government health officials have recommended and mandated precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus, including shelter-in-place orders, prohibitions on public gatherings and other similar measures. There is uncertainty around the duration and breadth of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the impact it will have on the companys operations, supply chain and demand for its products. As a result, the ultimate impact on the companys business, financial condition or operating results cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\nNote 11 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nOn August 1, 2021, the Board of Directors approved compensation to Vikram Grover CEO of $10,000 per month, broken down as $2,500 cash $7,500 stock if the Company is not SEC current, and $5,000 cash $5,000 stock when brought SEC current.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nDisclosure controls and procedures are designed with an objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, such as this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Disclosure controls are also designed with an objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer, to allow timely consideration regarding required disclosures.\nThe evaluation of our disclosure controls by our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer) included a review of the controls objectives and design, the operation of the controls, and the effect of the controls on the information presented in this Annual Report. Our management, including our chief executive officer, does not expect that disclosure controls can or will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud, if any. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Also, projections of any evaluation of the disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that the disclosure controls and procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive, financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that there were material weaknesses in our internal controls over Financial reporting as of July 31, 2022 and they were therefore not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commissions rules and forms. The material weaknesses in our controls and procedure were a lack adequate staffing and supervision within the accounting operations of our Company. Management does not believe that any of these weaknesses materially affected the results and accuracy of its financial statements. However, in view of this discovery of such weaknesses, management has begun a review to improve them.\nMANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company in accordance as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Our internal controls framework is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagements assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuers internal control over financial reporting is as of the year ended July 31, 2022. We believe that internal controls over financial reporting as set forth above shows some weaknesses and are not effective. We have identified certain weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations.\nUnder applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as a smaller reporting company this Annual Report does not include an attestation report of the Companys registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
