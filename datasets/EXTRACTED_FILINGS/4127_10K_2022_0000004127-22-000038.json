A widening range of use cases is driving an insatiable demand for ubiquitous wireless data across a broad array of applications, including remote work, entertainment, fitness, virtual education and meetings, telemedicine, factory automation, connected cars, mobile internet, cloud gaming, and AR/VR technology. This results in an extraordinary need for faster speeds, increased bandwidth and capacity, significantly lower latency, and more reliable and secure wireless connectivity.\nThe speed and ultra-low latency characteristics inherent in 5G technology are dramatically altering wireless connectivity, creating a market for diverse and transformative applications, and changing how individuals live, work, play, and learn. Most of the worlds largest economies are implementing commercial 5G networks, and the worlds leading smartphone manufacturers have launched multiple generations of 5G-enabled devices.\nWe see a continued expansion in data consumption, dependent on seamless, reliable, and ubiquitous wireless connectivity. A few statistics illustrate this point. According to the 2021 Ericsson Mobility Report, global wireless data traffic is expected to grow at a 27% annual rate over the next five years. Machine-to-machine connections, the fastest-growing IoT category, is expected to soon surpass 15 billion devices. By 2030, we expect there will be 650 million connected cars worldwide, each consuming 25 times the data that we see in todays smartphones. We are helping to enable these opportunities with highly customized solutions supporting a broad set of wireless systems and protocols including cellular, 5G, Wi-Fi, GPS, Bluetooth, Accutime\u2122, HD-Radio\u2122, LoRa\u00ae, Thread\u00ae, and Zigbee\u00ae. In addition, next-generation Wi-Fi 6 and 6E products are emerging as the standard offering across enterprise, carrier, and retail segments and are expected to accelerate the deployment of IoT devices.\nLooking forward, we see significant growth opportunities for our industry and for Skyworks. The key catalyst is the increasing demand for wireless data as the world embraces 5G and other advanced connectivity technologies.\nSolving Connectivity Challenges\nHighly integrated semiconductor solutions are playing an increasingly essential and pivotal role in the deployment of next-generation standards by resolving the daunting analog, mixed-signal, and RF complexities that are challenging the capabilities of existing hardware and the supporting network infrastructure. Delivering on these design challenges requires broad competencies including signal transmission and conditioning, the ability to ensure seamless hand-offs between multiple standards, power management, voltage regulation, battery charging, advanced filtering, and tuning.\nWe are at the forefront of this new era of connectivity, delivering the solutions that help enable the true potential of 5G and the IoT. We have a rich heritage in analog systems design and have spent years investing in key technologies and resources. Our strength is underpinned by world-class performance and scale across a broad array of capabilities that include advanced TC-SAW and BAW filters, an expanded family of MIMO, ultra-high band, and diversity receive modules, timing devices, and digital power isolators. From our breakthrough Sky5\u00ae unifying platform to our 5G small cell solutions, our approach across both infrastructure and user equipment facilitates powerful, high-speed, end-to-end 5G connectivity.\nSkyworks' Strategy\nOur ambitious vision is to connect everyone and everything, all the time. Major elements of our strategy include:\nIndustry-Leading Technology\nAs the industry migrates to more complex 5G architectures across a multitude of wireless applications, we are well-positioned to help mobile device manufacturers handle growing levels of system complexity across both the transmit and receive chains. The trend towards increasing front-end and analog design challenges in smartphones and other platforms plays directly into our core strengths and positions us to address these challenges. We believe that we offer the broadest portfolio of radio and analog solutions from the transceiver to the antenna as well as all required manufacturing process technologies. We also hold strong technology leadership positions in passive devices, advanced integration, including proprietary shielding and 3-D die stacking, as well as SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filters. Our product portfolio is reinforced by a library of approximately 4,600 worldwide patents and other intellectual property that we own and control. Together, our industry-leading technology enables us to deliver the highest levels of product performance and integration.\nCustomer Relationships\nGiven our scale and technology leadership, we are engaged with all of the major original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), smartphone providers, and baseband reference design partners in the analog and mixed-signal semiconductor industry. Our customers value the scale of our global supply chain, our innovative technology, our ability to curate and deliver unique solutions, and our system engineering expertise, resulting in deep customer loyalty. We partner with our customers to support their long-term product road maps and are valued as a system solutions provider rather than just a point product vendor.\nDiversification\nWe are diversifying our business by expanding our addressable markets and broadening our product portfolio to reach a wider array of global customers. With the increasing adoption of 5G and the opportunity to enable more applications, we are growing our business beyond mobile devices (where we support all top-tier manufacturers, including the leading smartphone suppliers and key baseband vendors) into additional high-performance analog markets, including automotive, home and factory automation, data center, solar, wireless infrastructure, aerospace and defense, medical, smart energy, and wireless networking. In these markets we leverage our scale, intellectual property, and worldwide distribution network, which spans more than 6,000 customers and 7,600 unique products.\nDelivering Operational Excellence\nWe vertically integrate our supply chain where we can differentiate ourselves with highly specialized internal manufacturing capabilities or enter into alliances and strategic relationships for leading-edge technologies. This hybrid manufacturing model allows us to better balance our manufacturing capacity with the demand of the marketplace, resulting in a strong return on invested capital on a broader range of revenue.\nAdditionally, we continue to drive reductions in product design and manufacturing cycle times and further improve product yields. The combination of agile, flexible capacity, and world-class module manufacturing and scale advantage allows us to achieve low product costs while integrating multiple technologies into highly sophisticated multi-chip modules and helping to ensure stable supply to our global customer base.\nMaintaining a Performance-Driven Culture\nWe consider our people and corporate culture to be a competitive advantage and a key component of our corporate strategy. We create key performance indicators that align employee efforts and link responsibilities with performance measurement. Accountability is paramount, and we compensate our employees through a pay-for-performance methodology.\nGenerating Superior Operating Results and Stockholder Returns\nWe believe our manufacturing scale, broad product portfolio, strong profitability, and consistent cash flow generation position us to provide superior results and strong returns to our stockholders.\nOur Product Portfolio\nOur extensive product portfolio includes:\nAmplifiers: the modules that strengthen the signal so that it has sufficient energy to reach a base station\nAntenna Tuners: aperture and impedance tuning products that improve antenna performance across frequencies\nAttenuators: circuits that allow a known source of power to be reduced by a predetermined factor (usually expressed as decibels)\nAutomotive Tuners and Digital Radios: tuners, data receivers, and digital radio coprocessors used in automotive infotainment systems\nCirculators/Isolators: ferrite-based components commonly found on the output of high-power amplifiers used to protect receivers in wireless transmission systems\nWireless ASoC: an intelligent 2.4 GHz and 5GHz wireless radio integrated circuit that includes all the analog and digital functions optimized for building cognitive wireless audio headsets, headphones, and wireless speaker systems\nDC/DC Converters: an electronic circuit which converts a source of direct current from one voltage level to another\nDemodulators: a device or an RF block used in receivers to extract the information that has been modulated onto a carrier or from the carrier itself\nDetectors: devices used to measure and control RF power in wireless systems\nDigital Power Isolators: energy efficient solutions used in industrial control, solar inverters and hybrid/electric automotive drive trains\nDiodes: semiconductor devices that pass current in one direction only\nDirectional Couplers: transmission coupling devices for separately sampling the forward or backward wave in a transmission line\nDiversity Receive Modules: devices used to improve receiver sensitivity in high data rate applications\nFilters: devices for recovering and separating mixed and modulated data in RF stages, including SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filters\nFront-end Modules: two or more functions co-packaged to optimize the performance, cost, and application suitability in products, including intermediate or radio frequency signal paths\nHybrid: a type of directional coupler used in radio and telecommunications\nLED Drivers: devices which regulate the current through a light-emitting diode or string of diodes for the purpose of creating light\nLow-Noise Amplifiers: devices used to reduce system noise figure in the receive chain\nMixers: devices that enable signals to be converted to a higher or lower frequency signal and thereby allowing the signals to be processed more effectively\nModulators: devices that take a baseband input signal and output a radio frequency modulated signal\nOptocouplers/Optoisolators: semiconductor devices that allow signals to be transferred between circuits or systems while ensuring that the circuits or systems are electrically isolated from each other\nPhase Locked Loops: closed-loop feedback control system that maintains a generated signal in a fixed phase relationship to a reference signal\nPhase Shifters: designed for use in power amplifier distortion compensation circuits in base station applications\nPower Dividers/Combiners: utilized to equally split signals into in-phase signals as often found in balanced signal chains and local oscillator distribution networks\nReceivers: electronic devices that change a radio signal from a transmitter into useful information\nSwitches: components that perform the change between the transmit and receive function, as well as the band function for cellular handsets\nSynthesizers: devices that provide ultra-fine frequency resolution, fast switching speed, and low phase-noise performance\nTiming Devices: wireless clocks and oscillators used in optical networking, data center and wireless base stations\nTechnical Ceramics: polycrystalline oxide materials used for a wide variety of electrical, mechanical, thermal, and magnetic applications\nVoltage Controlled Oscillators/Synthesizers: fully integrated, high performance signal source for high dynamic range transceivers\nVoltage Regulators: generate a fixed level which ideally remains constant over varying input voltage or load conditions\nWe believe we possess broad technology capabilities and one of the most complete wireless communications product portfolios in the industry.\nMarketing and Distribution\nOur products are sold globally through a direct sales force, electronic component distributors, and independent sales representatives. As is customary in the semiconductor industry, our distributors may also market other products that compete with ours.\nOur sales engagement begins at the earliest stages of the design of an existing or potential customers product. We collaborate technically with our customers and reference design partners at the inception of new programs. These relationships allow our team to facilitate customer-driven solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our intellectual property and product portfolio while providing high value and greatly reducing time-to-market.\nWe believe the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an extraordinary commitment to maintain close ongoing relationships with our customers. We also employ a collaborative approach in developing these relationships by combining the support of our design teams, applications engineers, manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff, and senior management. Lastly, we leverage our customer relationships with cross-selling opportunities across product lines in order to maximize revenue.\nWe believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to feedback, we are able to mobilize resources to raise our level of customer satisfaction, improve our ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market dynamics. We are confident that diligently following this path positions us to participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.\nCustomer Concentration\nA small number of OEMs historically has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022 (fiscal 2022), October 1, 2021 (fiscal 2021), and October 2, 2020 (fiscal 2020), Apple, through sales to multiple distributors and contract manufacturers for multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, desktop and notebook computers, watches, and other devices, constituted more than ten percent of our net revenue. For further information regarding customer concentrations, see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nWe own or have a license to use numerous United States and foreign patents and patent applications related to our products and our manufacturing operations and processes. In addition, we own a number of trademarks and service marks applicable to certain of our products and services. We believe that our intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, trade secrets, and trademarks, is of material importance to our business. We rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property laws, as well as non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, designs, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. Our efforts may not meaningfully protect our intellectual property, or others may independently develop substantially equivalent or superior proprietary technologies, designs, devices, algorithms, processes, or other intellectual property. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, patent, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. In addition to protecting our intellectual property, we strive to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio to enhance our ability to obtain cross-licenses of intellectual property from others, to obtain access to intellectual property we do not possess, and to more favorably resolve potential intellectual property claims against us. Due to rapid technological changes in the industry, we believe establishing and maintaining a technological leadership position depends primarily on our ability to develop new, innovative products through the technical competence of our engineering personnel.\nCompetitive Conditions\nThe competitive environment in the semiconductor industry is in a constant state of flux, with new products continually emerging and existing products approaching technological obsolescence. We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new\nproduct innovation, quality, performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and baseband vendors, personnel, and protection of our intellectual property. We participate in highly competitive markets against numerous competitors that may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products.\nResearch and Development\nOur products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity. We invested $617.9 million, $532.3 million, and $464.1 million in research and development during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, respectively. The growth in research and development expenses were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development activity for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development expenses include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, development of new packaging and test capabilities, and research on next-generation technologies and product opportunities. We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our intent not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. However, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources, and we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders. However, we have entered into certain supply agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other manufacturing-related services that specify minimum prices and purchase quantity based on our anticipated future requirements. Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities to which we take title as needed in our manufacturing process. We have taken strategic action with suppliers located around the world to secure sourcing of the raw materials and components necessary for our manufacturing.\nBacklog and Inventory\nOur sales are primarily from the sale of semiconductor products under individual customer purchase orders, some of which have underlying master sales agreements that specify terms governing the product sales. In the absence of a sales agreement, the Companys standard terms and conditions apply. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer hub locations. We do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations. Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volume could result in a reduction in revenue and us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nGovernment Regulations\nWe are subject to international, federal, state, and local legislation, regulations, and other requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment; the treatment, transport, and disposal of hazardous wastes; recycling and product packaging; worker health and safety; and other activities affecting the environment, our workforce, and the management of our manufacturing operations. In addition, most of our customers have mandated that our operations and our products comply with various green initiatives and workers rights initiatives initiated by such customers, industry groups in which such customers participate, or the jurisdictions in which such customers operate. We believe that our operations and facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws. Our efforts to comply with environmental laws and worker health and safety laws could have material impacts on our capital expenditures, competitive position, or financial condition, though the magnitude and duration of such impacts are uncertain and difficult to quantify.\nWe are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. These controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions (including those discussed below in Item 1A, Risk Factors) have had, and we believe may continue to have, a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components.\nGovernment regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nSeasonality\nSales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications, such as smartphones and tablet computing devices. The highest demand for our products generally occurs in our first fiscal quarter ending in December and the fourth fiscal quarter ending in September. The lowest demand for our products generally occurs in our second fiscal quarter ending in March and the third fiscal quarter ending in June.\nEmployees\nOur workforce consists of approximately 11,150 employees located around the world, more than 99% of whom are full-time employees. As of September 30, 2022:\nOur workforce was distributed geographically approximately as follows: 55% in Mexico, 24% in the United States, 20% in Asia, 1% in Canada, and less than 1% in Europe.\nOur workforce was distributed by function approximately as follows: 47% in individual contributor manufacturing roles, 32% in engineering or technician roles, 10% in managerial roles, and 11% in professional or other administrative roles.\nApproximately 4,100 of our employees in Mexico, 290 of our employees in Singapore, and 460 of our employees in Japan were covered by collective bargaining and other union agreements.\nWe focus on attracting and retaining employees by providing compensation and benefits packages that are competitive within the applicable market for each position. Nearly all full-time employees across the globe are eligible to participate in one of the Companys incentive plans, under which payments are tied to pre-established performance goals, as well as to purchase shares of the Companys common stock at a discount from its market price pursuant to the Companys employee stock purchase plans. In addition, we believe that developing our employees skill sets and decision-making abilities-through challenging project assignments, formal training, mentorship, and recognition-is key not only to our employees job satisfaction and our retention efforts, but also to maintaining a strong leadership pipeline. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, some of which have manifested and any of which may occur in the future, in addition to the other information contained in this report before making an investment decision with respect to any of our securities. Our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted by any of these risks, which could in turn adversely affect our stock price. Additional risks not currently known to us or other factors not perceived by us as material risks could also present significant risks to our business.\nRisks associated with operating a global business\nThe risks of doing business internationally apply to all aspects of our operations.\nWe derive significant revenues from customers located outside the United States, primarily in countries located in the Asia-Pacific region and Europe. We have suppliers located outside the United States, including third-party packaging, assembly, and test facilities and semiconductor foundries located in the Asia-Pacific region. We also operate our own wafer fabrication facilities in Osaka, Japan, as well as packaging, assembly, and test facilities in Singapore and in Mexicali, Mexico. Our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in selling and operating in multiple jurisdictions. These include, but are not limited to, risks regarding:\nRecession or economic downturn globally or in the jurisdictions in which we do business,\ncurrency controls and currency exchange rate fluctuations, including increases or decreases in commodities prices related to such fluctuations,\ninflation, as well as changes in existing and expected rates of inflation, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,\ninterest rates, as well as changes in existing and expected interest rates, which may vary across the jurisdictions in which we do business,\nglobal, regional, and local economic and political conditions, including, but not limited to, social, economic, political, and supply chain instability related to the uncertainty regarding the relationships among the United States, China, Taiwan, Russia, Mexico, North Korea, Middle Eastern countries, other foreign countries, and the international community at large, as well as related to armed conflicts, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, that exist, or in the future could exist, in various jurisdictions around the world,\nrestrictive governmental actions (such as restrictions on transfer of funds, restrictions on individuals movement, including travel restrictions, quarantines, lockdowns, and curfews, and trade protection measures, including export duties, quotas, customs duties, border taxes, border closures, increased import or export controls, and tariffs), or actions by non-governmental individuals and groups (such as protests, boycotts, insurgencies, organized crime, and general civil unrest), that could negatively impact trade between, or increase the cost of operating in, the countries in which we do business,\nlabor market conditions and laws,\ndisruptions of capital and trading markets,\ndifficulty in collecting, or failure to collect, accounts receivable, as well as longer collection periods,\nchanges in, or non-compliance with, legal or regulatory import/export requirements, including restrictions on selling to certain customers or into certain jurisdictions,\nnatural disasters and severe weather events, including, but not limited to, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, hurricanes, tsunamis, rising sea levels, as well as other impacts of climate change,\nacts of terrorism, widespread illness or other deterioration of public health conditions, and war,\nmisappropriation or other unauthorized transfers of our electronic information and breaches of our information systems, as well as the potential lack of adequate remedies in certain jurisdictions,\ndifficulty in engaging distribution partners or obtaining sales or other business support in certain jurisdictions,\ncultural differences in the conduct of business,\ndirect or indirect government actions, subsidies, or policies aimed at supporting local industry,\nthe laws and policies of the United States and other countries affecting trade, foreign investment and loans, foreign travel, and import or export licensing requirements, including, but not limited to, prohibitions on certain trade and other activities in China, Russia, Belarus, and portions of Ukraine,\nwithdrawal from, or renegotiation of, existing trade agreements by the United States (or other jurisdictions) potentially affecting Mexico, China, and other countries in which we do business,\nchanges in current or future tax law or regulations or new interpretations thereof, by federal or state agencies or foreign governments,\nchanges in the effective tax rate as a result of our overall profitability and mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\nresults of audits and examination of previously filed tax returns, and\nlimitations on our ability under local laws to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights in a particular foreign jurisdiction.\nAdditionally, we are subject to risks in certain global markets in which wireless operators provide subsidies on handset sales to their customers. Increases in cellular handset prices that negatively impact handset sales can result from changes in regulatory policies or other factors, which could impact the demand for our products.\nSome of the countries in which we operate and seek to expand are in emerging markets where legal systems may be less developed or familiar to us, potentially impacting our ability to obtain appropriate recourse in the event of a dispute. Other jurisdictions in which we conduct business have established, or may establish, legal and regulatory regimes that differ materially from United States laws and regulations. It is costly, time-consuming, and requires significant resources to comply with the numerous, and sometimes conflicting, legal regimes in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business on matters as diverse as anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, competition, data privacy and protection, employment, and labor relations. Violations of one or more of these legal regimes laws and regulations in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines, penalties, or monetary damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business, unfavorable publicity and other reputation damage, restrictions on our ability to process information, and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nThe effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic continue to adversely affect our business operations.\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic-including the public health crisis, the measures taken by governments, businesses, and individuals in an effort to limit COVID-19s spread, and the resulting global supply chain challenges-has adversely affected, and continues to adversely affect, our business operations. The impacts on our business operations and workforce of the pandemic, including as a result of more contagious variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, and the duration of such impacts, are uncertain, constantly evolving, and difficult to quantify, but have thus far included, or in the future may include, the following:\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions to our supply chain and increased costs in connection with the sourcing of materials, components, equipment, assembly and test services, engineering support, shipping and logistics services, and other services, caused in part by the pandemic. To the extent we are unable to pass these costs on to our customers, we experience reduced profitability. Given that our customers and suppliers are facing similar supply chain challenges, we expect continued difficulty in forecasting demand and supply needs for the foreseeable future. As a result of these uncertainties, we have increased, and may continue to increase, our inventory levels and purchase commitments.\nWe have recently experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, reduced demand for certain of our products as a result of certain customers difficulty obtaining materials, components, and services due to disruptions in such customers supply chains. While the government-mandated shutdowns in various regions of China during fiscal 2022 did not directly impact any of our manufacturing facilities, the shutdowns did result in limited supply constraints within our supply chain, as well as significant supply constraints for certain of our customers, which resulted in short-term reductions in such customers demand for our products. We may continue to experience large fluctuations in demand for certain of our products, which could be exacerbated by global supply chain challenges or by a continued or deepening global economic downturn or recession.\nIn the event that our manufacturing operations in Mexicali, Mexico, become subject to significant restrictions or are suspended again, as they were for two weeks in April 2020 pursuant to a government order, or in the event that one or more of our other facilities is forced to suspend or limit its activities, we may again experience reductions in production levels, which would limit our ability to meet customer demand and impact our operating results.\nOver the course of the pandemic, we have implemented certain measures at our facilities worldwide in an effort to protect our employees health and well-being, some of which have reduced the overall efficiency of our operations and increased manufacturing costs. Many of our non-manufacturing employees transitioned to working from home on a mandatory or voluntarily basis for a prolonged period of time, and our return-to-office plans have in some cases led to employee attrition. We expect that pandemic-related changes in workforce patterns may result in additional attrition, difficulty in hiring, and reduced productivity.\nWe have experienced, and likely will continue to experience, disruptions to global transportation networks, limiting or delaying our ability, and/or increasing our cost, to send or receive products and materials at one or more of our facilities, including as a result of trade restrictions, border closures, disruptions in the operations of third-party carriers, or carriers decisions to prioritize other customers orders over ours.\nSignificant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. We may experience negative impacts to our business operations if one or more of these major customers were to significantly decrease its orders for our products due to disruptions to its business operations or other pandemic-related issues.\nThese effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, customer and supplier relations, employee relations, cash flows, and financial condition. The resumption of normal business operations after any such interruptions may be delayed or constrained by lingering effects of the pandemic on our customers, suppliers, and other third-party service providers.\nThe degree to which the pandemic continues to impact us will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. Even after the pandemic has subsided as a public health matter, we may experience material adverse impacts to our business as a result of its adverse impact on the global economy.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business in China.\nDemand from Chinese customers may be adversely affected by Chinas evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs and restrictions, currency controls, environmental regulations, information security, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent, and the potential issuance of new laws and regulations creates uncertainty. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, United States-China relations, or China-Taiwan relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties, or currency revaluations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In particular, the imposition by the United States of tariffs on goods imported from China, or deemed to be of Chinese origin, and other government actions that restrict our ability to sell our products to Chinese customers or to manufacture or source components in China, and countermeasures imposed by China in response, could directly or indirectly adversely impact our manufacturing costs, the availability and cost of materials, and the sales of our products in China and elsewhere. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions, and might continue expanding export restrictions, by adding certain Chinese entities to the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Securitys Entity List (the Entity List), which has, and could in the future, limit our ability to sell to certain of those entities and to third parties that do business with those entities. These restrictions have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, sales of our products. In the future, we may be prevented from shipping, or be required to obtain a license to ship, our products to certain customers if they are added to the Entity List. In addition, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt the operations of several companies in Taiwan that are suppliers to, or third-party partners of, the Company, our customers, and our customers other suppliers. Disruption of certain critical operations in Taiwan would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and would likely have substantial negative effects on the entire semiconductor industry. Further, the evolving labor market and increasing labor unrest in China may have a negative impact on our customers, which would result in a negative impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Finally, Chinas investments in technology development and manufacturing capability in support of its stated policy of reducing its dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers and other technology companies has likely already resulted, and we expect will continue to result, in reduced demand for our products in China and other key markets as well as reduced supply of critical materials for our products.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe are subject to taxation in many different countries and localities worldwide. To the extent the tax laws and regulations in these various countries and localities could change, our tax liability in general could increase.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Reform Act), which significantly reformed the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our operations. Beginning in fiscal year 2023, for U.S. income tax purposes we will be required to capitalize our research and development expenses and amortize them over five or fifteen years, rather than deduct them in the year incurred, which we expect will increase our taxes payable, resulting in reduced cash flows. Furthermore, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which imposes a corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on adjusted financial statement income for certain corporations, as well as an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases. Although we are currently evaluating the impact this law may have, we do expect our effective tax rate to increase in fiscal year 2024.\nBecause the changes in U.S. tax law require a number of complex calculations that previously were not required, our actual tax liability may differ materially from our income tax provisions, estimates, and accruals. Changes in our interpretations and assumptions, as well as additional guidance issued under these laws, could increase income tax liabilities and/or reduce certain tax benefits. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to changes to tax law.\nFuture changes in tax laws, regulations, and treaties, or the interpretation thereof, in addition to initiatives related to the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project of the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development; the European Commissions state aid investigations; enactment of a global corporate minimum tax; and other developments could have an adverse effect on the taxation of international businesses, including our own. Furthermore, countries where we are subject to\ntaxes, including the United States, evaluate their tax policies and rules on a regular basis, and we may see significant changes in legislation and regulations concerning taxation.\nWe are unable to predict what tax changes may be enacted in the future or what effect such changes would have on our business, but such changes could affect our effective tax rates in countries where we have operations and could have an adverse effect on our overall tax position in the future, along with increasing the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.\nRisks associated with the development, manufacturing, and sale of our products\nOur operating results may be adversely affected by quarterly and annual fluctuations, market downturns, and recessions.\nOur revenues, earnings, and other operating results may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly and annual basis. These fluctuations are typically the result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nThese factors include, among others:\ndelays in the widespread deployment of commercial 5G networks,\nchanges in end-user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers,\nthe effects of competitive pricing pressures, including decreases in average selling prices of our products,\nproduction capacity levels and fluctuations in manufacturing yields,\navailability and cost of materials and services from our suppliers,\nthe gain or loss of significant customers,\nour ability to develop, introduce, and market new products and technologies on a timely basis,\nmarket acceptance of our products and our customers products (including, but not limited to, market acceptance of new, emerging technologies),\nnew product and technology introductions by competitors,\ndelays in the adoption of standards by standard-setting bodies and delays in the commercial deployment or consumer adoption of certain technologies,\nactions by government regulators to restrict or delay the availability of sufficient spectrum for wireless technologies, including technologies that utilize unlicensed spectrum and/or shared spectrum,\nchanges in consumers purchasing behaviors, including the rates at which they replace smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,\nchanges to promotions, rebates, and discounts offered by carriers in certain geographic regions for smartphones and other devices that utilize our products,\nincreasing industry consolidation among our competitors,\nchanges in the mix of products produced and sold, and\nintellectual property disputes, including those concerning payments associated with the licensing and/or sale of intellectual property, and related remedies (e.g., monetary damages, injunctions, or exclusion orders affecting our or our customers products).\nWe employ certain methods, assumptions, estimates, and other subjective judgments in order to apply our accounting policies and to project future performance, and such projections may be publicly disclosed from time to time. Changes to such methods, assumptions, estimates, and judgments, combined with other factors that are difficult to forecast, including the factors listed above, could materially and adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results and could produce actual operating results that differ significantly from previous estimates and projections. If our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors, it could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock.\nWe rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our sales.\nSignificant portions of our sales are concentrated among a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted, which could adversely affect our stock price. In each of fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020, one customer accounted for greater than ten percent of our net revenue. For further discussion see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe rely on Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) to design our products into their end products.\nOur products are not sold directly to the end user but are components or subsystems of other products. As a result, we rely on OEMs and ODMs of wireless communications electronics products to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment. Without these design wins, we would have difficulty selling our products. If a manufacturer designs another suppliers product into one of its product platforms, it is more difficult for us to achieve future design wins with that platform because changing suppliers involves significant cost, time, effort, and risk on the part of that manufacturer. Also, achieving a design win with a customer does not ensure that we will receive revenue from that customer. Even after a design win,\nthe customer is not obligated to purchase our products and can choose at any time to reduce or cease use of our products, for example, if its own products are not commercially successful, or for any other reason. We may not continue to achieve design wins or to convert design wins into actual sales, and failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, as a result of our lengthy product development and sales cycle, we may incur significant research and development expenses, and selling, general, and administrative expenses, without generating the anticipated revenue associated with these products.\nOur manufacturing processes are extremely complex, specialized, and subject to disruption.\nOur manufacturing operations are complex and subject to disruption, including due to causes beyond our control. The fabrication of integrated circuits is an extremely complex and precise process consisting of hundreds of separate steps. It requires production in a highly controlled, clean environment. Minor impurities, contamination of the clean room environment in which our products are produced, errors in any step of the fabrication process, defects in the masks used to print circuits on a wafer, defects in equipment or materials, human error, or a number of other factors can cause a substantial percentage of our products to be rejected or to malfunction. Because our operating results are highly dependent upon our ability to produce integrated circuits at acceptable manufacturing yields, these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, our operations may be affected by lengthy or recurring disruptions of operations at any of our production facilities, as well as disruptions at facilities operated by our subcontractors or customers. These disruptions may result from electrical power outages, water shortages, fire, earthquake, flooding, war, acts of terrorism, health advisories or risks, or other natural or man-made disasters, as well as equipment maintenance, repairs, and/or upgrades. Disruptions of our manufacturing operations, or those of our subcontractors and customers, could cause significant delays in shipments until we are able to shift production of the impacted products from an affected facility or subcontractor to another facility or subcontractor, or until the affected customer resumes operations and accepts shipments from us. In the event of such delays, the required alternative capacity, particularly wafer production capacity, may not be available on a timely basis or at all. Even if alternative production capacity is available, we may not be able to obtain it on favorable terms, which could result in higher costs and/or a loss of customers and revenue. Likewise, lower-than-expected demand could lead to underutilized manufacturing facilities, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWhile we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate business continuity risks, among other risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Due to the highly specialized nature of our manufacturing processes, in the event of a disruption in production at one or more of our facilities for any reason, alternative production capacity would not be immediately available from third-party sources. These disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Our key facilities include, but are not limited to, our semiconductor wafer fabrication facilities in Newbury Park, California, and Woburn, Massachusetts, our SAW, TC-SAW, and BAW filter wafer fabrication facilities in Osaka, Japan, and our assembly and test facilities in Mexicali, Mexico, and in Singapore.\nWe may not be able to maintain and improve manufacturing yields that contribute positively to our gross margin and profitability.\nMinor deviations or disturbances in the manufacturing process can cause substantial manufacturing yield loss, and in some cases, cause production to be suspended and impact our ability to meet customer demand on a timely basis. Manufacturing yields for new products initially tend to be lower as we complete product development and commence volume manufacturing, and typically increase as we bring the product to full production. Our forward product pricing includes this assumption of improving manufacturing yields and, as a result, material variances between projected and actual manufacturing yields will have a direct effect on our gross margin and profitability. The difficulty of accurately forecasting manufacturing yields and maintaining cost competitiveness through improving manufacturing yields will continue to be magnified by the increasing process complexity of manufacturing semiconductor products. Our manufacturing operations may also face pressures arising from the compression of product life cycles, which may require us to manufacture new products faster and for shorter periods while maintaining acceptable manufacturing yields and quality without, in many cases, reaching the longer-term, high-volume manufacturing conducive to higher manufacturing yields and declining costs.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture, assembly, and testing of our products.\nWe rely on foundries to provide silicon-based products and to supplement our gallium arsenide wafer manufacturing capacity. There are significant risks associated with reliance on third-party foundries, including:\nthe lack of wafer supply, potential wafer shortages, and higher wafer prices,\nrequired minimum purchase commitments,\nlimited ability to respond to unanticipated changes in customer demand,\nlimited control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, production costs, process technologies, and quality assurance, and\nthe inaccessibility of, or delays in obtaining access to, key process technologies, materials, and IP blocks.\nEven in cases where we have long-term supply arrangements to obtain additional external manufacturing capacity, the third-party foundries we use for our standby manufacturing capacity may allocate their limited capacity to the production requirements of other customers and in general we have no contractual right to prevent them from making such allocations. If we choose to use a new foundry to replace either existing or backup capacity, it will typically take an extended period of time for us to complete our qualification process for that foundry, which will result in a significant passage of time before we can begin shipping products from that new foundry.\nFurther, the third-party foundries may experience financial difficulties or changes in control, be unable to deliver products to us in a timely manner, be unwilling to invest in processes that meet our needs, or suffer damage or destruction to their facilities, particularly since some of them are located in areas prone to natural disasters or to severe weather events and other impacts of climate change. If any disruption of manufacturing capacity occurs, we may not have alternative manufacturing sources immediately available. We may therefore experience difficulties, delays, or additional costs in securing an adequate supply of our products, which could impair our ability to meet our customers needs and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAlthough we own and operate assembly and test facilities, as part of our supply resilience and business continuity strategies we still depend on subcontractors to package, assemble, and test certain of our products at cost-competitive rates. For those assembly and test subcontractors with whom we do not have long-term agreements, we typically procure services on a per-order basis. If any of our subcontractors experiences capacity constraints or financial difficulties, suffers any damage to its facilities, experiences power outages or any other disruption of assembly or testing capacity, we may not be able to obtain alternative assembly and testing services in a timely manner and/or at cost-competitive rates. Due to the amount of time that it usually takes us to qualify assembly and test subcontractors, we could experience significant delays and/or increased costs in product shipments if we are required to find alternative assembly and test subcontractors for our components. Any problems that we may encounter with the delivery, quality, or cost of our products could damage our customer relationships and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDuring fiscal 2022, we entered into long-term capacity reservation and supply agreements with certain third-party foundries. These agreements may cease to be commercially reasonable if overall market demand or pricing is reduced, and they may have an adverse effect on our operating results in the event our future supply needs are reduced below the minimum order commitments. Furthermore, even with such agreements, we remain subject to risks that a supplier will be unable to meet its supply commitments, achieve acceptable manufacturing yields, operate or deliver on a timely basis, or provide additional capacity beyond its current contractual commitments to meet our requirements, any of which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer obligations.\nWe are dependent upon third parties for the supply of raw materials and components.\nOur manufacturing operations depend on obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and components used in our manufacturing processes at a competitive cost. Although we maintain relationships with suppliers located around the world with the objective of ensuring that we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs, increases in demand from the semiconductor industry for such raw materials and components (including, but not limited to, precious and rare earth metals), as well as increased demand for commodities in general, can result in tighter supplies and higher costs. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our delivery schedules; we may lose a significant or sole supplier; a supplier may not be able to meet performance and quality specifications; shipments of precious metals may be subject to theft; and we may not be able to purchase such supplies or materials at a competitive cost. If a supplier were unable to meet our delivery schedules, if we lost a supplier, or if a supplier were unable to meet performance or quality specifications, our ability to satisfy customer obligations would be materially and adversely affected because the time required to identify and qualify an alternative supply source, where available, is typically lengthy. In part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced supply constraints for certain materials and components, which has impacted, and could continue to impact, production lead times, the cost of such materials and components, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products.\nIn addition, we review our relationships with suppliers of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs on an ongoing basis. In connection with our ongoing review, we may modify or terminate our relationship with one or more suppliers. We may also enter into sole supplier arrangements to meet certain of our raw material or component needs. While we do not typically rely on a single source of supply for our raw materials, we are currently dependent on a limited number of sole-source suppliers and in the future could become dependent on additional sole-source suppliers. If we were to lose these sole sources of supply, for any reason, a material adverse effect on our business could result until an alternate source is obtained. To the extent we enter into additional sole supplier arrangements for any of our raw materials or components, the risks associated with our supply arrangements would be exacerbated. Furthermore, our entry into capacity commitments in an attempt to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and components may result in our obligation to pay above-market prices in the event of a future downward price correction.\nWe may not be able to effectively operate our business if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nAs the source of our technological and product innovations, our key engineering and technical personnel represent a significant asset. Our success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, including executive officers and other key management, engineering, and technical personnel. The competition for management, engineering, and technical personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry, particularly in the locations in which we operate, and therefore we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the design, development, manufacture, and sale of our products. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies, which in some cases may be able to offer compensation opportunities in excess of what we offer. We may have particular difficulty attracting and retaining key personnel during periods of poor operating performance and/or declines in the price of our common stock, given, among other factors, the use of equity-based compensation by us and our competitors. If we are unable to obtain required stockholder approval for future increases in the number of shares available under our long-term incentive plans, we may be limited in granting equity-based incentive awards, which may impair our efforts to attract and retain necessary personnel. Further, existing immigration laws, together with any changes to immigration policies or regulations in the United States, make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities (in the United States or abroad), limiting the pool of available talent. Travel bans, difficulties obtaining visas, and other restrictions on international travel make it more difficult to effectively manage our international operations, collaborate as a global company, and service our international customer base. The increased ability of employees in our industry to work from home or in other remote work arrangements has impacted, and may continue to impact, the mobility and turnover of our employees, potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in the job market. We continue to anticipate increases in human resource needs, particularly in engineering. The loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business.\nOur business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy.\nOur success depends, in large part, on the continued contributions of our senior management team, none of whom is bound by a written employment contract to remain with us for a specified period. The loss of any member of our senior management team could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate. In addition, the loss of certain members of our senior management team could harm our relationships with key customers, which could negatively impact our future revenue, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe are subject to uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of, and payment for, our products.\nOur sales are typically made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products and not under long-term supply arrangements with our customers. Our customers may seek to cancel or defer orders before shipment. Additionally, we sell a portion of our products through third-party distributors, some of whom have rights to return products if the product is nonconforming. We may purchase and manufacture inventory based on estimates of customer demand for our products, which is difficult to predict and may not be accurate. The difficulties of forecasting may be compounded when we sell to OEMs indirectly through distributors or contract manufacturers, or both, as our forecasts of demand will then be based on estimates provided by multiple parties. In addition, our customers and distributors may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. Many of our products are customized to the needs or specifications of a specific customer or have a limited number of potential buyers. The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volumes could result in us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. On the other hand, customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice, which could result in damaged customer relationships, increased manufacturing costs, increased liabilities, or harm to our reputation if we are unable to meet such increases in demand. Some of our customers have implemented vendor-managed inventory, consignment, or similar inventory programs that may result in an increase in the time between manufacture of, and payment for, our products.\nIn addition, if a customer or distributor encounters financial difficulties of its own as a result of a change in demand or for any other reason, the customers or distributors ability to make timely payments against our accounts receivable could be impaired. Furthermore, our dependence on third-party carriers and logistics firms, many of which have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in, and could continue to result in, delays, increased costs, and expedite fees related to our product shipments.\nWe face a risk that capital needed for our business will not be available when we need it.\nTo the extent that our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities (including, but not limited to, capital expenditures), we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing. If unfavorable capital market conditions exist in the event we were to seek additional financing, we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on favorable terms and on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to obtain capital when required by our business circumstances would have a material adverse effect on us.\nIn addition, the future growth of our business is likely to require the expansion of our manufacturing facilities, the upgrade of our manufacturing equipment, strategic investments, and/or corporate acquisitions. Due in part to our repayment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness, the capital required to fund these investments may not be available in the future.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe incurred significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisition of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Labs, which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business.\nOn May 21, 2021, the Company, as borrower, entered into a term credit agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $1.0 billion Term Loan Facility. Additionally, on May 26, 2021, the Company issued $500 million of its 0.900% 2023 Notes, $500 million of its 1.800% 2026 Notes, and $500 million of its 3.000% 2031 Notes in a public offering. The proceeds of the Term Loan Facility and the issuance of Notes were used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Companys acquisition of certain assets, rights, and properties, and its assumption of certain liabilities, comprising Silicon Labs Infrastructure and Automotive business, on July 26, 2021 (the Acquisition).\nAdditionally, on May 21, 2021, the Company entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement with various financial institutions, as lenders, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, providing for a $750 million Revolver. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility could be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThis indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions. We also have incurred, and will continue to incur, various costs and expenses associated with our indebtedness. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles, and financial, business, and other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control. We are exposed to interest rate risk through our Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility, both of which are subject to variable interest rates, and interest rate increases have led to increased interest payments. Our existing indebtedness or incurrence of any additional indebtedness could reduce funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.\nIn addition, our credit ratings, combined with fluctuating interest rates, affect the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organizations opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve a particular rating or maintain a particular rating in the future. An inability to obtain or maintain a rating could increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings of our indebtedness, limit our access to sources of financing in the future, or lead to other potentially adverse consequences.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various covenants that impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that govern the Term Loan Facility, the Notes, and the Revolver contain various affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, change the nature of our business, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain assets to any one person. In addition, some of the agreements contain a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations. Any such acceleration of our repayment obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and/or stock price.\nTo be successful we may need to make additional investments and acquisitions, integrate companies we acquire, and/or enter into strategic alliances.\nAlthough we have invested in the past, and intend to continue to invest, significant resources in internal research and development activities, the complexity and rapidity of technological changes and the significant expense of internal research and development make it impractical for us to pursue development of all technological solutions on our own. On an ongoing basis, we review investment, alliance, and acquisition prospects that would complement our product offerings, augment our market coverage, or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to identify and consummate suitable investment, alliance, or acquisition transactions in the future. Moreover, if such transactions are consummated, they could result in:\nissuances of equity securities dilutive to our stockholders,\nrestructuring or other impairment write-offs,\nthe incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities,\nthe potential loss of key employees from the acquired company,\nrecognition of additional liabilities known or unknown at the time of acquisition,\namortization expenses related to intangible assets, and\nthe diversion of managements attention from other business concerns.\nMoreover, integrating acquired organizations and their products and services may be difficult, expensive, time-consuming, and a strain on our resources and our relationships with employees and customers and ultimately may not be successful. Additionally, in periods following an acquisition, we will be required to evaluate goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets for impairment. If such assets are found to be impaired, they will be written down to estimated fair value, with a charge against earnings.\nRisks associated with our industry\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to significant downturns.\nWe operate in the semiconductor industry, which is cyclical and subject to rapid declines in demand for end-user products in both the consumer and enterprise markets. Uncertain worldwide economic and political conditions, together with other factors such as the volatility of the financial markets, continue to make it difficult for our customers and for us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities. Uncertainty and economic weakness could result in a market contraction and, as a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would likely be materially and adversely affected. Such periods of industry downturn are characterized by diminished product demand and revenue, manufacturing overcapacity, excess inventory levels, accelerated erosion of average selling prices, bad debt, inventory charges, restructuring charges, and asset impairment charges. Furthermore, downturns in the semiconductor industry may be prolonged, and any extended delay or failure of the market to recover from an economic downturn would materially and adversely impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition, which could adversely affect our stock price.\nThe wireless communications and analog semiconductor markets are characterized by significant competition.\nThe wireless communications semiconductor industry, in general, and the other analog markets in which we compete are very competitive, which may cause pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and rapid loss of market share. We compete with international and United States semiconductor manufacturers of all sizes in terms of resources and market share, including, but not limited to, Analog Devices, Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Murata Manufacturing, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments.\nWe currently face significant competition in our markets and expect that intense price and product competition will continue. This competition has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, declining average selling prices for many of our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing revenue, gross margin, and market share. Furthermore, additional competitors may enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in communications electronics, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes (including national or regional policies, and/or state-sponsored investments, intended to develop and support localized competitors). We believe that the principal competitive factors for semiconductor suppliers in our markets include, among others:\nrapid time-to-market and product ramps (including, but not limited to, high-volume product ramps),\ntimely new product innovation,\nability to capture design wins in new growth markets, such as 5G,\nproduct quality, reliability, and performance,\nability of certain products, including high reliability solutions, to perform under stringent operating conditions,\nproduct cost and selling price,\nfeatures available in products,\nalignment with customer performance specifications,\ncompliance with industry standards,\nstrategic relationships with customers,\naccess to, and the protection and enforcement of, intellectual property,\nability to partner with or participate in reference designs of baseband vendors,\nmaintaining access to manufacturing capacity, raw materials, supplies, and services at a competitive cost, and\nthe ability to secure government incentives and grants, such as funding available to U.S. semiconductor manufacturers under the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022.\nWe might not be able to successfully address these factors. Many of our competitors benefit from:\nlong presence in key markets,\nbrand recognition,\nhigh levels of customer satisfaction,\nvertical integration,\nstrong baseband partnership/participation in reference designs,\na broad product portfolio allowing them to bundle product offerings,\nownership or control of key technology or intellectual property, and\nstrong financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical, or other resources.\nAs a result, certain competitors may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products than we can. As a result of industry consolidation, certain competitors may be able to further exploit such benefits to strengthen their competitive position.\nOur baseband reference design partners may leverage their market position by integrating additional functionality into their product offerings that compete with our solutions. If such a product offering were competitive with our solution as to performance, price, and quality, or if the interoperability of our solution with the partners baseband products were to be restricted, our business could be adversely impacted.\nCurrent and potential competitors have established, or may in the future establish, financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with customers, resellers, or other third parties. These relationships may affect customers purchasing decisions. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge, causing such competitors to rapidly acquire significant market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and potential competitors. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, decreased gross margins, and loss of revenue and market share and may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nRemaining competitive in the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to constantly innovate.\nThe semiconductor industry generally and, in particular, many of the markets into which we sell our products, are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, continuous product evolution, price erosion, evolving technical standards, short product life cycles (including annual product refreshes in some cases), increasing demand for higher levels of integration, increased miniaturization, reduced power consumption, and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. Our operating results depend largely on our ability to continue to cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis, both within our traditional markets and in new, expanded, or adjacent markets. The successful development and commercialization of semiconductor devices and modules is highly complex and depends on numerous factors, including the ability:\nto anticipate customer and market requirements and changes in technology and industry standards,\nto obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity within an international supply chain to meet customer demand,\nto define new products that meet customer and market requirements,\nto complete development of new products and bring products to market on a timely basis,\nto differentiate our products from offerings of our competitors,\nto achieve overall market acceptance of our products,\nto lengthen the time that a particular product is in demand,\nto source and maintain manufacturing materials,\nto identify and maintain suppliers with the necessary technology and scale to support the increasing complexity of our manufacturing requirements, and\nto obtain adequate multi-jurisdictional intellectual property protection for our new products.\nOur ability to manufacture current products, and to develop new products, depends on, among other factors, the viability and flexibility of our own internal information technology systems.\nWe continually evaluate expenditures for planned product development and choose among alternatives based on our understanding of customer technical requirements, new industry standards, and expectations of future market growth and technologies. We may not be able to develop and introduce new or enhanced wireless communications and analog semiconductor products in a timely and cost-effective manner, and our products may not satisfy customer requirements or achieve market acceptance, or we may not be able to anticipate new industry standards and technological changes. We also may not be able to respond successfully to new product announcements and introductions by competitors or to changes in the design or specifications of complementary products of third parties with which our products interface. If we fail to rapidly and cost-effectively introduce new and enhanced products in sufficient quantities that meet our customers requirements, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, prices of many of our products decline, sometimes significantly, over time. Our products may become obsolete earlier than planned or may not have life cycles long enough to allow us to recoup the cost of our investment in designing such products. Accordingly, we believe that to remain competitive, we must continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering existing products at the same time that we develop and introduce new or enhanced products. We may not be able to continue to reduce the cost of producing and delivering our products in a timely manner and thereby remain competitive.\nIn order to remain competitive, we expect to continue to transition many of our products to increasingly smaller geometries and form factors. This transition often requires us to upgrade our capital equipment, modify the manufacturing processes for our products, design new products to more stringent standards, and redesign some existing products. We have experienced some difficulties migrating to smaller geometry process technologies or new manufacturing processes, which resulted in sub-optimal manufacturing yields, delays in product deliveries, and increased expenses. We may face similar difficulties, delays, and expenses as we continue to transition our products to smaller geometry processes in the future. In some instances, we depend on our relationships with our third-party foundries and packaging subcontractors to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully. Our manufacturing partners may not be able to effectively manage the transition, or we may not be able to maintain our relationships with certain manufacturing partners. If our manufacturing partners or we experience significant delays in this transition or fail to efficiently implement this transition, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. As smaller geometry processes become more prevalent, we expect to continue to integrate greater levels of functionality, as well as customer and third-party intellectual property, into our products. However, we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis, or at all.\nIncreasingly stringent environmental laws, rules, regulations, and customer expectations may require us to redesign our existing products and processes and could adversely affect our ability to cost-effectively produce our products.\nThe semiconductor industry has been subject to increasing environmental regulations, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage, and disposal of certain chemicals, elements, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Heightened public focus on climate change, sustainability, and environmental issues has also led to increased government regulation and caused certain of our customers to impose environmental standards on us as a part of doing business with them. We expect that the trend of increasing environmental awareness will continue, which will result in higher costs of operations. In addition, our commitment to environmentally sustainable practices, while undertaken in a manner designed to be as efficient and cost effective as possible, may result in increases in costs of operations for us relative to our competitors until technologies and methods are developed that will help reduce those costs or such practices become industry best practice.\nA number of domestic and foreign jurisdictions restrict or may seek to restrict the use of various substances, a number of which have been or are currently used in our products or processes. For example, the European Union Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) Directive requires that certain substances, which may be found in certain products we have manufactured in the past, be removed from all electronics components. Eliminating such substances from our manufacturing processes requires the expenditure of additional research and development funds to seek alternative substances for our products, as well as increased testing by third parties to ensure the quality of our products and compliance with the RoHS Directive. While we have implemented a compliance program to ensure our product offering meets these regulations, there may be instances where alternative substances will not be available or commercially feasible, or may only be available from a single source, or may be significantly more expensive than their restricted counterparts. Additionally, if we were found to be non-compliant with any such rule or regulation, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and/or restrictions imposed by government agencies that could adversely affect our operating results.\nRegulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or adjoining countries, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict-free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers, and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free, we may face challenges with our customers, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. In addition, our customers may begin to require reports on our sourcing of other minerals or substances, which may impact our ongoing operations and increase our operating costs.\nNew climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which we do business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, regulations on energy management and waste management, and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future.\nFurthermore, environmental regulations often require parties to fund remedial action for violations of such regulations regardless of fault. Consequently, it is often difficult to estimate the future impact of environmental matters, including potential liabilities. In addition, our customers increasingly require warranties or indemnity relating to compliance with environmental regulations. The amount of expense and capital expenditures that might be required to satisfy environmental liabilities, to complete remedial actions, and to continue to comply with applicable environmental laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on ESG topics such as climate change, carbon emissions, water usage, waste management, human capital, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report. We expect that these and other rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies, interpretations, and expectations, as well as increased enforcement actions by various governmental and regulatory agencies, will continue to increase the cost of our compliance and internal risk management programs and to alter the environment in which we do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. If our ESG practices and disclosures do not meet the expectations and standards of our stockholders, customers, and other industry stakeholders, our reputation and business activities may be negatively impacted and our appeal to certain investors may be reduced.\nRisks associated with cybersecurity and intellectual property protection\nWe may not be able to prevent, or timely detect, information technology security breaches.\nSecurity breaches, phishing, spoofing, attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, networks, and databases, and other cyberattacks continue to become more sophisticated and persistent and are sometimes successful. These incidents, which might be related to industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, include covertly introducing malware and spyware to our computers, networks, and products (or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit) and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to prevent, detect, and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude, duration, and effects. The theft, unauthorized use, transfer, or publication of our intellectual property, our confidential business, financial, and/or technical information, or the personal data of our employees and customers by third parties or by our employees could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business and technology development. To the extent that any security breach or other cybersecurity incident results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers, suppliers, licensees, or employees confidential or personal information, we may incur liability, face contractual and regulatory fines and penalties, and sustain significant financial resources to remediate such breach. Such an incident could, among other things, also damage our reputation, impair our ability to attract and retain our customers, impact our stock price, and materially damage our supplier relationships. If a ransom-style cyberattack or similar incident impedes our ability to use or access our information systems for an extended period of time, this could adversely affect our business operations and financial results. In addition, certain suppliers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, including foundries, assembly and test contractors, and distributors, have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to cybersecurity incidents, misappropriation efforts, or network disruptions that could jeopardize our proprietary or sensitive data, impact such third parties ability to meet their obligations to us, or otherwise negatively impact our ongoing business operations. Geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the tensions between China and Taiwan, may create a heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents. We expect to continue devoting significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, networks, and databases, including through the training of our employees and monitoring the security posture of critical third parties who have access to our systems or sensitive data. However, we cannot ensure that these security measures and monitoring efforts will be sufficient to prevent or mitigate the damage caused by a cybersecurity incident or network disruption, and our systems may be vulnerable to hacking, insider threats, employee error or manipulation, theft, system malfunctions, or other adverse events. While we maintain insurance coverage to mitigate some of these risks, such coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise. Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require companies overall information technology security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous, and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws, to the extent applicable, may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, certain of our products contain firmware that incorporates or is derived from open source software that generally is made publicly available by its developers or other third parties. Risks related to the use of open source software include, but are not limited to, the introduction of cybersecurity vulnerabilities into our products or development platforms, our compliance with applicable licensing terms, subjecting certain of our derivative works or software enhancements to public disclosure and/or unfavorable licensing conditions, potential restrictions on our ability to market the firmware associated with our products, and enhanced governmental or other third-party scrutiny of our products.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must be able to successfully protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property rights and laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements and other methods, to protect our confidential and proprietary technologies, inventions, information, data, devices, algorithms, processes, and other intellectual property. In addition, we often incorporate the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties into our designs, and we have obligations with respect to the non-use and non-disclosure of such third-party intellectual property. From time to time, it may be necessary to engage in litigation or like activities to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the validity, enforceability, and scope of proprietary rights of others, including our customers. This could require us to expend significant resources and to divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from our business operations. Regardless of our actions:\nthe steps we take to prevent misappropriation, infringement, dilution, or other violation of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers, suppliers, or other third parties may not be successful,\nany of our existing or future patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, or other intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, deemed unenforceable, or circumvented, and\nwe may be contractually prohibited, or otherwise discouraged, by certain customers from pursuing remedies for third parties violations of our intellectual property.\nA third party could potentially copy, misappropriate, or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization, develop similar technology independently, or design around or invalidate our patents. If any of our intellectual property protection mechanisms fails to protect our technology, it would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar competitive products, potentially resulting in loss of market share and price erosion. Even if we receive a patent, the patent claims may not be broad enough to adequately cover and protect our technology or could be rendered invalid or unenforceable. Furthermore, even if we receive patent protection in the United States, we may not seek, or may not be granted, patent protection in other relevant foreign countries. In addition, effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection and enforcement may be unavailable, impractical, or limited for certain technologies and in certain foreign countries.\nWe attempt to control access to, and distribution of, our proprietary and confidential information through operational, technological, and legal safeguards. Despite our efforts, parties, including current and former employees, consultants, customers, licensees, suppliers, vendors, and other third-party affiliates may attempt to copy, disclose, transfer, misappropriate or obtain access to our information without our authorization. Furthermore, attempts by computer hackers to gain unauthorized access to our systems or information could result in our confidential and/or proprietary information being compromised or our manufacturing and other business operations being interrupted. While we make reasonable attempts to prevent such unauthorized access or misappropriation, we may be unable to anticipate, detect, or stop the methods used, or we may be unable to prevent the release of our confidential and/or proprietary information or that of a third party.\nWe are subject to the risks of licensing third-party intellectual property.\nWe sell products in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles, and increasing levels of integration. Many of our products currently use or incorporate technology licensed or acquired from third parties and we expect our products in the future to also require technology from third parties. Our ability to keep pace with this market depends on our ability to obtain technology from third parties on commercially reasonable terms to allow our products to remain competitive. If licenses to such technology for our current or future products become unavailable or the terms on which they are available become commercially unreasonable, and we cannot otherwise acquire or integrate such technology, our products or our customers products could become unmarketable or obsolete, we could lose market share, and our business could be adversely affected. In such instances, we could also incur substantial unanticipated costs or scheduling delays to develop or acquire substitute technology to deliver competitive products. These risks are heightened with respect to certain of our products that incorporate increasing amounts of digital circuit content that is subject to third-party intellectual property rights.\nRisks associated with claims and litigation\nWe may be subject to warranty claims, product recalls, liability claims, and risks of litigation.\nAlthough we invest significant resources in the testing of our products, from time to time we become aware of alleged defects in our products after they have been shipped, and we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs or cash payments to settle claims pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. Certain of our products, including high reliability solutions, may not be able to perform under stringent operating conditions. Examples of our high reliability solutions include applications intended for the aerospace, automotive, defense, and medical markets. The potential liabilities associated with these, and similar, provisions in certain of our customer contracts are in some cases capped at significant amounts, and in other cases are uncapped. In addition, because our customers typically integrate our products into other devices, and because we typically do not have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products, our products may be used in applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested, and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications. Depending on the nature of any product defect claims, we may not be able to recoup our losses from our third-party suppliers. Investigating, analyzing, and/or remediating alleged product defects may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or third parties, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, indemnification claims, product redesigns, or obligations under customer contracts. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality, or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, such losses would not be covered under our existing corporate insurance programs. In addition, in the event we are unable to fulfill our contractual obligations, lawsuits may be threatened or filed against us by customers or other third parties. Furthermore, force majeure clauses in our contracts could limit our ability to pursue remedies for certain third-party disruptions and delays. From time to time, we\nare, and may become, involved in litigation. We are the plaintiff in some of these actions and the defendant in others. Such actions could result in the imposition of various remedies such as injunctions or monetary damages, which if awarded could materially harm our business. From time to time, we are, and may become, the subject of inquiries, requests for information, or investigations by government and regulatory agencies regarding our business. Any such matters, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management, damage our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nWe may be subject to claims of infringement of third-party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third-party technology.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection, enforcement, and pursuit of intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future assert, patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights against technologies that are important to our business and manufacturing operations and have demanded and may in the future demand that we license their technology or refrain from using it.\nAny litigation to determine the validity of any allegations that our products infringe or may infringe or misappropriate the intellectual property rights of another party, including indemnification claims arising from our contractual obligations to our customers, regardless of their merit or resolution, could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel. Regardless of the merits of any specific claim, we may not prevail in litigation because of the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation or the assessment of these claims. If litigation were to result in an adverse ruling, we could be required to:\npay substantial damages,\ncease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of infringing products or processes,\ndiscontinue the use of infringing technology,\nexpend significant resources to develop an alternate non-infringing technology, and\nlicense technology from the third party claiming infringement, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nOur operating results or financial condition may be materially adversely affected if we, or one of our customers, were required to take any one or more of the foregoing actions.\nIn addition, if another supplier to one of our customers, or a customer of ours itself, were found to be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of a third party, the supplier or customer could be ordered to cease the manufacture, import, use, sale, or offer for sale of its infringing product(s) or process(es), either of which could result, indirectly, in a decrease in demand from our customers for our products. If such a decrease in demand for our products were to occur, it could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nRisks associated with owning our common stock\nOur stock price has been volatile and may fluctuate in the future.\nThe trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate significantly. Such fluctuations may be influenced by many factors, including:\nthe volatility of the financial markets,\nuncertainty regarding the prospects of the domestic and foreign economies,\ninstability in global credit and financial markets,\nour performance and prospects, and the performance and prospects of our major customers and competitors,\nthe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour revenue concentrations with relatively few customers,\nthe depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock,\nthe inclusion, exclusion, or removal of our stock from market indices, such as the S&P 500 Index,\nour stock repurchase and dividend activities,\nthe timing of our repayment of outstanding indebtedness,\ninvestor perception of us and the industry in which we operate,\nchanges in the market valuations of other companies, including, but not limited to, those in our industry,\nchanges in earnings estimates, price targets, or buy/sell recommendations by analysts,\ndomestic and international political conditions,\ndomestic and international tax, fiscal, and trade policy decisions, and\nour ability to successfully identify, acquire, and integrate acquisition candidates.\nPublic stock markets have experienced price and trading volume volatility. This volatility has affected, and could significantly and negatively affect in the future, the market prices of securities of many technology companies, particularly the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, fluctuations in our stock price, volume of shares traded, and changes in our trading multiples may make our stock attractive to momentum, hedge, day-trading, or activist investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly, exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction. We have been, and in the future may be, the subject of commentary by financial news media. Such commentary may contribute to volatility in our stock price. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts, the financial news media, or investors, our stock price may decline, possibly substantially over a short period of time.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase our stock.\nWe pay, and intend to continue to pay, quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations made by our Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. In addition, from time to time the Board of Directors approves stock repurchase programs, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\nFuture cash dividends and the amount and timing of our stock repurchases may be affected by, among other factors:\nour views on potential future capital requirements, including those related to acquisitions as well as research and development,\nour ability to generate sufficient earnings and cash flows,\nour use of cash to consummate various acquisition transactions,\nour repayment of principal and interest on our indebtedness,\ncapital requirements related to cash dividends and stock repurchase programs,\nchanges in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws, and\nchanges to our business model.\nOur cash dividend payments may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will increase our cash dividend payment or declare cash dividends in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in our cash dividend payments or a reduction in the level of our stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law may make it difficult for someone to acquire control of us.\nWe have certain anti-takeover measures that may affect our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation, our by-laws, and the Delaware General Corporation Law contain several provisions that would make it more difficult to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by our Board of Directors. Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws include provisions such as:\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series without further authorization of stockholders,\na prohibition on stockholder action by written consent,\na requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders,\na requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the provisions of our certificate of incorporation relating to the election and removal of directors or the right to act by written consent,\na requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 80% of our shares be obtained for business combinations unless approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors and, in the event that the other party to the business combination is the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in office prior to the time such other party became the beneficial owner of 5% or more of our shares, and\na fair price provision, as well as a requirement that the affirmative vote of at least 90% of our shares be obtained to amend or repeal the fair price provision.\nIn addition to the provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law generally provides that a corporation may not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three-year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless a majority of the directors then in office approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder or specified stockholder approval requirements are met.

ITEM 6. [RESERVED] ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially and adversely from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those described below and in Item 1A Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW\nWe, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, are empowering the wireless networking revolution. Our highly innovative analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things, spanning a number of new and previously unimagined applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, defense, entertainment and gaming, industrial, medical, smartphone, tablet, and wearable markets.\nImpact of COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn are affecting business conditions in our industry. The duration, severity, and future impact of the pandemic, including as a result of more contagious variants of the virus that causes COVID-19, continue to be highly uncertain and could still result in significant disruptions to our business operations, as well as negative impacts to our financial condition. Like many companies in the semiconductor industry, we are experiencing various supply constraints due to the pandemic. While we are working with our global supply chain partners to mitigate this risk, the duration and extent of the supply chain disruptions remain uncertain.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFiscal Years Ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020.\nThe following table sets forth the results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net revenue. See Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2021, filed with the SEC on November 24, 2021, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to such Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on January 28, 2022 (the 2021 10-K), for Managements Discussions and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2020.\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nNet revenue 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 %\nCost of goods sold 52.5 50.8 51.9\nGross profit 47.5 49.2 48.1\nOperating expenses:\nResearch and development 11.3 10.3 13.7\nSelling, general, and administrative 6.0 6.3 6.9\nAmortization of intangibles 1.8 0.7 0.4\nRestructuring, impairment, and other charges 0.6 0.2 0.4\nTotal operating expenses 19.7 17.6 21.5\nOperating income 27.8 31.6 26.6\nInterest expense (0.9) (0.3) -\nIncome before income taxes 26.9 31.3 26.6\nProvision for income taxes 3.7 2.0 2.3\nNet income 23.2 % 29.3 % 24.3 %\nGeneral\nDuring the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, the following key factors contributed to our overall results of operations, financial position, and cash flows:\nNet revenue increased 7.4% to $5,485.5 million in fiscal 2022, as compared to $5,109.1 million in fiscal 2021. This increase in revenue was driven primarily by our acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 of the Infrastructure and Automotive business of Silicon Laboratories Inc. (the Acquisition) to support high-growth market segments, such as automotive including electric and hybrid vehicles, industrial and motor control, power supply, 5G wireless infrastructure, optical data communication and data center, and smart home. The increase in net revenue was also driven in part by an increase in demand for next-generation wireless connectivity products, including for 5G and advanced Wi-Fi solutions, from major OEMs and the associated increases in average content per device for these products, offset by a decrease in demand for our mobile products from smartphone customers in China.\nOur ending cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance decreased 43% to $586.8 million in fiscal 2022, as compared to $1,027.2 million in fiscal 2021. The decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities during fiscal 2022 was primarily due to the repurchase of 6.5 million shares of common stock for $886.8 million, capital expenditures of $489.4 million, and dividend payments of $373.1 million, partially offset by cash generated from operations of $1,424.6 million.\nNet Revenue\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nNet revenue $ 5,485.5 7.4% $ 5,109.1 52.3% $ 3,355.7\nWe market and sell our products directly to OEMs of communications and electronics products, third-party original design manufacturers and contract manufacturers, and indirectly through electronic components distributors. We generally experience seasonal peaks during our fourth and first fiscal quarters (which correspond to the second half of the calendar year), primarily as a result of increased worldwide production of consumer electronics in anticipation of increased holiday sales, whereas our second and third fiscal quarters are typically lower and in line with seasonal industry trends.\nThe increase in net revenue in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was driven primarily by the Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 to support high-growth market segments, such as automotive including electric and hybrid vehicles, industrial and motor control, power supply, 5G wireless infrastructure, optical data communication and data center, and smart home. The increase in net revenue was also driven in part by an increase in demand for next-generation wireless connectivity products, including 5G and advanced Wi-Fi solutions, from major OEMs and the associated increases in average content per device for these products, offset by a decrease in demand for our mobile products from smartphone customers in China.\nFor information regarding net revenue by geographic region and customer concentration, see Note 15 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross Profit\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nGross profit $ 2,604.3 3.7% $ 2,512.4 55.8% $ 1,612.9\n% of net revenue 47.5 % 49.2 % 48.1 %\nGross profit represents net revenue less cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials, labor, and overhead (including depreciation, share-based compensation, and amortization of acquisition intangibles, including inventory step-up expense) associated with product manufacturing. As part of our normal course of business, we intend to improve gross profit with efforts to increase unit volumes, improve manufacturing efficiencies, lower manufacturing costs of existing products, and by introducing new and higher value-added products.\nThe increase in gross profit in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily the result of a favorable product mix, including volume increases for new product introductions, with a gross profit impact of $453.8 million, partially offset by lower comparable unit volumes and an increase in amortization of acquisition intangibles, including inventory step-up due to additional intangible assets acquired as part of the Acquisition during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nResearch and development $ 617.9 16.1% $ 532.3 14.7% $ 464.1\n% of net revenue 11.3 % 10.4 % 13.8 %\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of direct personnel costs including share-based compensation expense, costs for pre-production evaluation and testing of new devices, non-production masks, engineering prototypes, and design tool costs.\nThe increase in research and development expense in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to headcount-related expenses, including share-based compensation, as a result of our increased investment in developing new technologies and products. The increase in headcount was partially due to the Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nSelling, general, and administrative $ 329.8 2.3% $ 322.5 39.4% $ 231.4\n% of net revenue 6.0 % 6.3 % 6.9 %\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses include legal and related costs, accounting, treasury, human resources, information systems, customer service, bad debt expense, sales commissions, share-based compensation expense, advertising, marketing, costs associated with business combinations completed or contemplated during the period, and other costs.\nThe increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to increases in headcount-related expenses, partially offset by a decrease in acquisition costs each as a result of the Acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nAmortization of intangibles $ 98.9 174.7% $ 36.0 205.1% $ 11.8\n% of net revenue 1.8 % 0.7 % 0.4 %\nThe increase in amortization expense for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to the intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as part of the Acquisition.\nRestructuring, Impairment, and Other Charges\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nRestructuring, impairment, and other charges $ 30.7 244.9% 8.9 (35.5)% 13.8\n% of net revenue 0.6 % 0.2 % 0.4 %\nRestructuring, impairment, and other charges incurred in fiscal 2022 were primarily related to the abandonment of previously capitalized in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects.\nRestructuring, impairment, and other charges incurred in fiscal 2021 were primarily related to an impairment on property, plant, and equipment.\nInterest Expense\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nInterest expense $ 47.9 257.5% $ 13.4 100.0% $ -\n% of net revenue 0.9 % 0.3 % - %\nThe increase in interest expense for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was due to the issuance of the Notes (as defined below) in May 2021 and the borrowing of the Term Loans (as defined below) in July 2021.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 Change October 1,\n2021 Change October 2,\n(dollars in millions)\nProvision for income taxes $ 201.4 100.6% $ 100.4 30.6% $ 76.9\n% of net revenue 3.7 % 2.0 % 2.3 %\nThe annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 of 13.6% was less than the United States federal statutory rate of 21.0% resulting primarily from foreign earnings taxed at rates lower than the federal statutory rate, a benefit from foreign-derived intangible income deduction (FDII), windfall tax deductions, research and development credits, and foreign tax credits, partially offset by a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) and an increase in the reserves for uncertain tax positions.\nThe increase in income tax expense in fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily due to a prior period decrease in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, partially offset by a decrease in income from operations and an increase in windfall tax deductions in the current period.\nSee Note 9 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding income taxes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSet forth below is a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nFiscal Years Ended\n(in millions) September 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nCash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 882.9 $ 566.7 $ 851.3\nNet cash provided by operating activities 1,424.6 1,772.0 1,204.5\nNet cash used in investing activities (378.9) (3,133.2) (581.4)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities (1,362.6) 1,677.4 (907.7)\nCash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 566.0 $ 882.9 $ 566.7\nCash provided by operating activities:\nCash provided by operating activities consists of net income for the period adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain operating assets and liabilities. The $347.4 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to unfavorable changes in working capital of $523.7 million, due primarily to increases in inventory and cash with deposits with suppliers.\nCash used in investing activities:\nCash used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and cash paid related to the purchase of marketable securities, offset by cash received related to the sale or maturity of marketable securities. The $2,754.3 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to a $2,751.0 million decrease in cash payments made for the fiscal 2021 acquisitions.\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities:\nCash used in financing activities consists primarily of proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings and cash transactions related to equity. The $3,040.0 million decrease in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2022, as compared to fiscal 2021, was primarily related to a decrease of $2,488.2 million in cash provided by long-term borrowings, an increase of $691.2 million in stock repurchase activity, a decrease of $200.0 million in repayments of Term Loans (as defined below), an increase of $33.3 million related to the minimum statutory payroll tax withholdings upon vesting of employee performance and restricted stock awards, and an increase of $32.5 million in dividend payments.\nLiquidity:\nCash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaled $586.8 million as of September 30, 2022, representing a decrease of $440.3 million from October 1, 2021.\nWe have outstanding $500.0 million of Notes Due 2023, $500.0 million of Notes Due 2026, and $500.0 million of Notes Due 2031 (the Notes). We have a term credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement) providing for a $1.0 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility). On July 26, 2021, the Company borrowed $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the Term Loans) under the Term Loan Facility to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company repaid $50.0 million and $250.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loans, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, there were $700.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Credit Agreement. We have a Revolving Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) under which we may borrow up to $750.0 million for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility (the Revolver). The Revolving Credit Agreement expires July 26, 2026.\nFor a description of contractual obligations, such as taxes, leases, and debt, see Note 9, Note 11, and Note 17 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.\nBased on our historical results of operations, we expect that our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on hand, the cash we expect to generate from operations, and funds from our Revolver, will be sufficient to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arising from: research and development, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, working capital, quarterly cash dividend payments (if such dividends are declared by the Board of Directors), outstanding commitments, and other liquidity requirements associated with existing operations. However, we cannot be certain that our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds from our Revolver will be available in the future to fund all of our capital and operating requirements. In addition, any future strategic investments and significant acquisitions may require additional cash and capital resources. If we are unable to obtain sufficient cash or capital to meet our needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms, our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur invested cash balances primarily consist of highly liquid marketable securities that are available to meet near-term cash requirements including: term deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in applying our most critical accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements. The SEC has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult, complex, or subjective judgments or estimates. Based on this definition, our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition, which impacts the recording of net revenue; inventory valuation, which impacts the cost of goods sold and gross margin; and income taxes, which impacts the income tax provision. These policies and significant judgments involved are discussed further below. We have other significant accounting policies that do not generally require subjective estimates or judgments or would not have a material impact on our results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers net of estimated reserves. Our revenue reserves contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the value of future credits to customers for product returns, price protection, price adjustments, and stock rotation for products sold to certain electronic component distributors. We base these estimates on the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including our historical experience and current expectations, and are reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. Changes in actual demand or market conditions could adversely or beneficially impact our reserve calculations.\nInventory Valuation. We value our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established on a quarterly basis and are based on a detailed analysis of aged material, salability of our inventory, market conditions, and product life cycles. Once reserves are established, write-downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory. Our reserves contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding historical experience, market conditions, and technological obsolescence. Changes in actual demand or market conditions could adversely impact our reserve calculations.\nIncome Taxes. The application of tax laws and regulations to calculate our tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. We record an amount as an estimate of probable additional income tax liability at the largest amount that we feel is more likely than not, based upon the technical merits of the position, to be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\nWe are subject to overall financial market risks, such as changes in market liquidity, credit quality, investment risk, interest rate risk, and foreign exchange rate risk as described below.\nInvestment and Interest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to interest rate and general market risks relates to our Term Credit Facility, which has variable interest rates, and our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2022, there were $700.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Credit Agreement, and a potential change in the associated interest rates would be immaterial to the results of our operations. Our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents (money market funds and marketable securities purchased with less than ninety days until maturity) that total approximately $566.0 million, and marketable securities (U.S. Treasury and government securities, corporate bonds and notes, and municipal bonds) that total approximately $20.3 million and $0.5 million within short-term and long-term marketable securities, respectively, as of September 30, 2022.\nThe main objectives of our investment activities are liquidity and preservation of capital. Our cash equivalent investments have short-term maturity periods that dampen the impact of market or interest rate risk. Our marketable securities consist of short-term and long-term maturity periods between 90 days and two years. Credit risk associated with our investments is not material because our investments are diversified across several types of securities with high credit ratings, which reduces the amount of credit exposure to any one investment.\nBased on our results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, a hypothetical reduction in the interest rates on our cash, cash equivalents, and other investments to zero would result in an immaterial reduction of interest income with a de minimis impact on income before taxes.\nWe do not believe that investment or interest rate risks currently pose material exposures to our business or results of operations.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\nSubstantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third-party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in United States dollars, thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results. A percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, and exchange rate volatility could positively or negatively impact those operating costs. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, we had foreign exchange losses of $1.4 million, $0.5 million, and $5.9 million, respectively. Increases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive, which could negatively impact our ability to compete. Conversely, decreases in the value of the United States dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us. Given the relatively small number of customers and arrangements with third-party manufacturers denominated in foreign currencies, we do not believe that foreign exchange volatility has a material impact on our current business or results of operations. However, fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business or results of operations in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies.\nWe may enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts with financial institutions to protect against foreign exchange risks associated with certain existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries. However, we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we had no outstanding foreign currency forward or options contracts with financial institutions. ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nThe following consolidated financial statements of the Company are included herewith:\n(1) Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n(2) Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three years ended September 30, 2022\n(3) Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the three years ended September 30, 2022\n(4) Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2022, and October 1, 2021\n(5) Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the three years ended September 30, 2022\n(6) Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity for the three years ended September 30, 2022\n(7) Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPage 44 through 63\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and October 1, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Companys management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable\nassurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nApplication of tax laws and regulations\nAs discussed in Note 2 and Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded an income tax provision of $201.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2022, which is comprised of current and deferred taxes on domestic and foreign income. The application of tax laws and regulations to calculate tax liabilities is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment, and uncertainty in a multitude of jurisdictions. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations, and court rulings.\nWe identified the evaluation of the application of tax laws and regulations in certain jurisdictions as a critical audit matter. Challenging auditor judgment and the involvement of tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge were required due to the Companys application of the tax laws and regulations within the manually prepared income tax provision.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Companys income tax process, including controls relating to the application of the tax laws and regulations.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries (Skyworks or the Company), is empowering the wireless networking revolution. The Companys analog and mixed-signal semiconductors are connecting people, places, and things, spanning a number of new applications within the aerospace, automotive, broadband, cellular infrastructure, connected home, defense, entertainment and gaming, industrial, medical, smartphone, tablet, and wearable markets.\n2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAll Skyworks subsidiaries are included in the Companys consolidated financial statements and all intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain items in the fiscal years 2021 and 2020 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\nFiscal Year\nThe Companys fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 each consisted of 52 weeks and ended on September 30, 2022, and October 1, 2021, respectively. Fiscal 2020 consisted of 53 weeks and ended on October 2, 2020.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, comprehensive income, and accumulated other comprehensive loss that are reported during the reporting period. The Company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment. Judgment is required in determining the reserves for, and fair value of, items such as overall fair value assessments of assets and liabilities, particularly those classified as Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, marketable securities, inventory, intangible assets associated with business combinations, share-based compensation, revenue reserves, loss contingencies, and income taxes. In addition, judgment is required in determining whether a potential indicator of impairment of long-lived assets exists and in estimating future cash flows for any necessary impairment testing. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company invests excess cash in time deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, agency securities, other government securities, corporate debt securities, and commercial paper. The Company considers highly liquid investments as cash equivalents including money market funds and investments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased.\nInvestments\nThe Company classifies its investment in marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Gains or losses are included in earnings in the period in which they are realized. The cost of securities sold is determined based on the specific identification method. The cost of available-for-sale debt securities is adjusted for premiums and discounts, with the amortization or accretion of such amounts included as a portion of interest. Available-for-sale debt securities with an original maturity date greater than three months and less than one year are classified as current investments. Available-for-sale debt securities with an original maturity date exceeding one year are classified as long-term.\nFair Value\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principle or most advantageous market in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Applicable accounting guidance provides a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that prioritize the use of observable inputs over the use of unobservable inputs, when such observable inputs are available. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets), or model-driven valuations in which all significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated with, observable market data.\nLevel 3 - Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable, including assumptions and judgments made by the Company.\nIt is the Companys policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. When available, the Company uses quoted market prices to measure fair value. If market prices are not available, the Company is required to make judgments about assumptions market participants would use to estimate the fair value of a financial instrument.\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in three levels, based on the market in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. It recognizes transfers within the fair value hierarchy at the end of the fiscal quarter in which the change in circumstances that caused the transfer occurred.\nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities.\nInventory\nInventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in, first-out basis. Reserves for excess and obsolete inventory are established on a quarterly basis and are based on a detailed analysis of aged material, salability of our inventory, market conditions, and product life cycles. Once reserves are established, write-downs of inventory are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of inventory.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation, with significant renewals and betterments being capitalized and retired equipment written off in the respective periods. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which range from five to forty years for buildings and improvements and three to ten years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the lesser of the economic life or the life of the associated lease.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its estimated incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments considering the term of the lease, which is derived from information available at the lease commencement date. The lease term includes renewal options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised and excludes termination options. To the extent that the Companys agreements have variable lease payments, the Company includes variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate and excludes those that depend on facts or circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time.\nLease expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets\nDefinite lived intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is calculated based on the pattern of benefit to be recognized from the underlying asset over its estimated useful life. Carrying values for long-lived assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant. Factors considered important that could result in an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected, historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of assets or the Companys business strategy, or significant negative industry or economic trends. In addition, impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of\nmanagement whenever asset values are deemed to be unrecoverable relative to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by that particular asset group. The determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset group and its eventual disposition. Such estimates require management to exercise judgment and make assumptions regarding factors such as future revenue streams, operating expenditures, cost allocation and asset utilization levels, all of which collectively impact future operating performance. The Companys estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, technological changes, economic conditions, changes to its business model, or changes in its operating performance. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the Company would recognize an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter for impairment or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist during the fiscal year. The Company assesses its conclusion regarding segments and reporting units in conjunction with its annual goodwill impairment test and has determined that it has one reporting unit for the purposes of allocating and testing goodwill.\nThe Companys impairment analysis compares its fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment. In the Companys calculation of fair value, it considers the closing price of its common stock on the selected testing date, the number of shares of its common stock outstanding and other marketplace activity such as a related control premium. If the calculated fair value is determined to be less than the book value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date acquired. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired identifiable net assets. The fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired are determined based upon the Companys valuation using a combination of market, income, or cost approaches. The valuation involves making significant estimates and assumptions, which are based on detailed financial models including the projection of future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, and any cost savings that are expected to be derived in the future from the viewpoint of a market participant.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products under individual customer purchase orders, some of which have underlying master sales agreements that specify terms governing the product sales. In the absence of a sales agreement, the Companys standard terms and conditions apply. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the Companys customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The Company applies a five-step approach as defined in FASB ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), in determining the amount and timing of revenue to be recognized: (1) identifying the contract with a customer; (2) identifying the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determining the transaction price; (4) allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognizing revenue when the corresponding performance obligation is satisfied.\nEach distinct promise to transfer products is considered to be an identified performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control of the products to the customer. Transfer of control occurs upon shipment to the distributor or direct customer or when products are pulled from consignment inventory by the customer. Point in time recognition is determined as products manufactured under non-cancellable orders create an asset with an alternative use to the Company. Returns under the Companys general assurance warranty of products have not been material, and warranty-related services are not considered a separate performance obligation.\nPricing adjustments and estimates of returns are treated as variable consideration for purposes of determining the transaction price. Sales returns are generally accepted at the Companys discretion or from distributors with stock rotation rights. Stock rotation allows distributors limited levels of returns and is based on the distributors prior purchases. Price protection represents price discounts granted to certain distributors and is based on negotiations on sales to end customers. Variable consideration is estimated using the expected value method considering all reasonably available information, including the Companys historical experience and its current expectations, and is reflected in the transaction price when sales are recorded. The Company records\nnet revenue excluding taxes on its sales to trade customers. The Company recognizes shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue and includes the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue.\nAccounts receivable represents the Companys unconditional right to receive consideration from its customer. Substantially all payments are collected within the Companys standard terms, which do not include a significant financing component. To date, there have been no material impairment losses on accounts receivable. There were no material contract assets or contract liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet in any of the periods presented. All incremental customer contract acquisition costs are expensed as they are incurred as the amortization period of the asset that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less in duration.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company recognizes compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors including non-qualified employee stock options, share awards and units, employee stock purchase plan, and other special share-based awards based on estimated fair values.\nThe fair value of share-based payment awards is amortized over the requisite service period, which is defined as the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award. The Company generally uses a straight-line attribution method for all grants that include only a service condition. Awards with both performance and service conditions are expensed over the service period for each separately vesting tranche.\nShare-based compensation expense recognized during the period includes actual expense on vested awards and expense associated with unvested awards. Forfeitures are recorded as incurred.\nThe determination of fair value of restricted and certain performance stock awards and units is based on the value of the Companys stock on the date of grant with performance awards and units adjusted for the actual outcome of the underlying performance condition.\nFor more complex performance awards including units with market-based performance conditions the Company employs a Monte Carlo simulation valuation method to calculate the fair value of the awards based on the most likely outcome. Under the Monte Carlo simulation, a number of variables and assumptions are used including, but not limited to: the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, a correlation coefficient, the risk-free rate, and dividend yield.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company records its best estimates of a loss contingency when it is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, the minimum estimated liability related to the claim is recorded. As additional information becomes available, the Company assesses the potential liability related to the potential pending loss contingency and revises its estimates. Material loss contingencies are disclosed if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may have been incurred and include estimated legal costs.\nRestructuring\nA liability for post-employment benefits is recorded when payment is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable. Contract exit costs include contract termination fees and are recognized in the period in which the Company terminates the contract.\nForeign Currencies\nThe Companys functional currency is the United States dollar. Gains and losses related to foreign currency transactions and conversion of foreign denominated cash balances are included in current results.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carry forwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is\nmore likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe carrying value of the Companys net deferred tax assets assumes the Company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, based on estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in its Consolidated Statement of Operations. Management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly. Likewise, in the event the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made.\nThe determination of recording or releasing tax valuation allowances is made, in part, pursuant to an assessment performed by management regarding the likelihood that the Company will generate future taxable income against which benefits of its deferred tax assets may or may not be realized. This assessment requires management to exercise judgment and make estimates with respect to its ability to generate revenues, gross profits, operating income, and taxable income in future periods. Amongst other factors, management must make assumptions regarding overall business and semiconductor industry conditions, operating efficiencies, the Companys ability to develop products to its customers specifications, technological change, the competitive environment, and changes in regulatory requirements which may impact its ability to generate taxable income and, in turn, realize the value of its deferred tax assets.\nThe calculation of the Companys tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations and is based on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nThe Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is more likely than not that the positions the Company has taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit, and the extent to which, additional taxes would be due. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary. If the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result. The Company recognizes any interest or penalties, if incurred, on any unrecognized tax liabilities or benefits as a component of income tax expense.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share incorporate the potentially dilutive incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan using the treasury share method. Shares issuable upon the vesting of performance stock awards are likewise included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as of the date the condition(s) have been satisfied, assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period.\nStock Repurchase\nThe Company accounts for stock repurchases in the consolidated balance sheet by reducing common stock for the par value of the shares, reducing paid-in capital for the amount in excess of par to zero during the period in which the shares are repurchased, and recording the residual amount, if any, to retained earnings.\nRecently Issued Accounting Guidance\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB) issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation and modified the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period. The guidance also clarifies and simplifies other aspects of the accounting for income taxes. The guidance was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. The new standard did not have a material effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\n3. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nOn July 26, 2021, the Company acquired the Infrastructure and Automotive (I&A) business of Silicon Laboratories Inc. (the Asset Purchase). The Asset Purchase accelerated the Companys expansion into high-growth segments, including electric and\nhybrid vehicles, industrial and motor control, power supply, 5G wireless infrastructure, optical data communication, data center, automotive, smart home, and several other applications.\nThe Company acquired the business for total cash consideration of $2.75 billion. Net revenue and net income from this acquisition have been included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from the acquisition date through the end of the fiscal year on October 1, 2021, and the impact of the acquisition to the ongoing operations on the Companys net revenue and net income was not material. The Company incurred $40.7 million in transaction-related costs during the fiscal year ended October 1, 2021, which were included within the selling, administrative, and general expense.\nThe allocation of the purchase price to the assets and liabilities recognized in the Companys acquisition of the I&A business was considered final at the time of filing the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The allocation of the purchase price is based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed by major class related to the Asset Purchase and are reflected, as of the acquisition date, in the accompanying financial statements as follows (in millions):\nAs of\nPurchase Price July 26,\nCash consideration $ 2,750.0\nFair value of partially vested equity awards 4.1\nTotal purchase consideration $ 2,754.1\nAllocation\nInventory, including step up $ 56.3\nProperty, plant, and equipment 4.4\nOther long-term assets 0.7\nIntangible assets 1,708.3\nGoodwill 986.2\nLiabilities assumed (1.8)\nEstimated fair value of net assets acquired $ 2,754.1\nGoodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and planned growth in strategic markets. This goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nAs of\nIntangible Assets July 26,\nDeveloped technology $ 960.1\nBacklog 154.6\nCustomer relationships and tradename 2.5\nTotal identified finite-lived intangible assets 1,117.2\nIn-process research and development (IPR&D)\n591.1\nTotal identified intangible assets $ 1,708.3\nDeveloped semiconductor technology relates to timing products including clocks and oscillators, power products including isolation and power-over-ethernet devices, and broadcast products including consumer and automotive radio devices.\nDeveloped technology was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected cash flows that are expected to be generated by the developed technology less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows. The weighted-average amortization period of approximately four years was determined based on the technology cycle related to each developed technology, as well as the cash flows over the forecast period.\nCustomer relationships and backlog represent the fair value of future projected revenue that will be derived from sales of products to existing customers of the I&A business. Backlog was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method under\nthe income approach, and customer relationships were valued using the replacement cost method under the cost approach. The cost approach estimates the amount of money required to replace the investment or asset with another having equivalent utility. The weighted-average amortization period of the customer relationships was determined based on historical customer acquisition rates under a distributor model and was fully amortized as of October 1, 2021. The weighted-average amortization period of the backlog of approximately two years was determined based on the expected life of the backlog and the cash flows over the forecast period.\nTradename relates to the Silicon Laboratories trade name. The fair value was determined by applying the relief-from-royalty method under the income approach. This method is based on the application of a market royalty rate to forecasted revenue under the trade name. The weighted-average amortization period was determined based on the expected life of the trade name and was fully amortized as of October 1, 2021.\nThe fair value of IPR&D was determined using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach. This method reflects the present value of the projected net cash flows that are expected to be generated by the IPR&D, less charges representing the contribution of other assets to those cash flows.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial results for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, combine the historical results of Skyworks with the unaudited historical results of the I&A business for the fiscal years ended October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, respectively.

A reconciliation of income tax expense as computed at the United States federal statutory income tax rate to the provision for income tax expense is as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nTax expense at United States statutory rate $ 310.1 $ 335.7 $ 187.3\nForeign tax rate difference (139.2) (155.2) (86.6)\nTax on deemed repatriation - - 0.2\nEffect of stock compensation (20.1) (13.5) (10.3)\nResearch and development credits (26.1) (27.0) (23.0)\nChange in tax reserve 7.4 (51.5) 9.6\nGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income 70.0 69.0 35.9\nForeign Derived Intangible Income (39.9) (79.7) (41.2)\nOther, net 39.2 22.6 5.0\nProvision for income taxes $ 201.4 $ 100.4 $ 76.9\nThe Company operates in foreign jurisdictions with income tax rates lower than the United States tax rate of 21.0% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020.\nThe Companys federal income tax returns for fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 are currently under Internal Revenue Service examination. The Company had accrued $18.6 million and $139.7 million of the deemed repatriation tax in short-term and long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet, respectively, as of September 30, 2022. The Company had accrued $18.6 million and $158.4 million of the deemed repatriation tax in short-term and long-term liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet, respectively, as of October 1, 2021. The remaining repatriation tax is payable over the next four years: $18.6 million in 2023, $34.9 million in 2024, $46.6 million in 2025, and $58.2 million in 2026.\nOn October 2, 2010, the Company expanded its presence in Asia by launching operations in Singapore. The Company operates under a tax holiday in Singapore, which is effective through September 30, 2030. The current tax holiday is conditioned upon the Companys compliance with certain employment and investment thresholds in Singapore. The impact of the tax holiday decreased Singapore taxes owed by $96.6 million, $99.5 million, and $63.1 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, respectively, which resulted in tax benefits of $0.59, $0.60, and $0.37 of diluted earnings per share, respectively. These tax benefits were partially offset by an increase in tax expense on GILTI.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities consist of the tax effects of temporary differences related to the following (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nDeferred tax assets:\nInventory $ 21.4 $ 15.8\nAccrued compensation and benefits 11.6 12.7\nProduct returns, allowances, and warranty 1.5 0.9\nShare-based and other deferred compensation 27.8 31.8\nNet operating loss carry forwards 14.0 7.1\nNon-United States tax credits 17.0 17.0\nState tax credits 138.0 126.9\nOperating leases 56.8 45.4\nPrepayments - 42.1\nProperty, plant, and equipment 31.4 35.8\nIntangible assets 20.4 -\nOther, net 8.7 15.0\nDeferred tax assets 348.6 350.5\nLess valuation allowance (161.4) (150.0)\nNet deferred tax assets 187.2 200.5\nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, plant, and equipment (59.2) (38.6)\nIntangible assets (4.7) (5.3)\nOperating leases (51.5) (40.4)\nOther, net (39.7) (15.6)\nNet deferred tax liabilities (155.1) (99.9)\nTotal net deferred tax assets $ 32.1 $ 100.6\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities based on tax jurisdictions are presented on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nDeferred tax assets $ 52.7 $ 119.5\nDeferred tax liabilities (20.6) (18.9)\nNet deferred tax asset $ 32.1 $ 100.6\nIn accordance with GAAP, management has determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the Companys historic and current year income tax benefits will not be realized. As of September 30, 2022, the Company has a valuation allowance of $161.4 million. This valuation allowance is comprised of $136.6 million related to United States tax credits, $4.8 million related to United States state net operating loss carry forwards, and $20.0 million related to foreign deferred tax assets. The United States tax credits relate primarily to California research tax credits that can be carried forward indefinitely, for which the Company has provided a full valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate sufficient taxable income or tax liability to utilize these United States and foreign credits. If these benefits are recognized in a future period, the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be reversed and up to a $161.4 million income tax benefit may be recognized. The Company will need to generate $130.6 million of future United States federal taxable income to utilize its United States deferred tax assets, excluding state deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance, as of September 30, 2022. The Company believes that future reversals of taxable temporary differences, and its forecast of continued earnings in its domestic and foreign jurisdictions, support its decision to not record a valuation allowance on other deferred tax assets. The Company will continue to assess its valuation allowance in future periods. The net valuation allowance increased by $11.4 million and $12.6 million in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, respectively, primarily related to increases for foreign and state net operating loss and tax credit carryovers.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows (in millions):\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nBalance at October 1, 2021 $ 55.3\nDecreases based on positions related to prior years (2.1)\nIncreases based on positions related to current year 9.3\nBalance at September 30, 2022 $ 62.5\nOf the total unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2022, $40.1 million would impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the effective tax rate, if recognized, due to the Companys valuation allowance and certain positions that were required to be capitalized.\nThe Company anticipates reversals within the next 12 months related to items such as the lapse of the statute of limitations, audit closures, and other items that occur in the normal course of business. Due to open examinations, an estimate of anticipated reversals within the next 12 months cannot be made. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2020, the Company recognized $1.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively, of interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. During fiscal 2021, the Company recognized an $11.6 million benefit for interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits. Accrued interest and penalties of $5.7 million and $4.5 million related to uncertain tax positions have been included in long-term tax liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2022, and October 1, 2021, respectively.\nThe Companys major tax jurisdictions as of September 30, 2022, are the United States, California, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and Singapore. For the United States, the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal 2018. For California, the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal 2000 due to the carry forward of tax attributes. For Canada, the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal 2015. For Mexico, the Company has open tax years back to fiscal 2014. For Japan, the Company has open tax years back to fiscal 2016. For Singapore, the Company has open tax years dating back to fiscal 2016. The Company is subject to audit examinations by the respective taxing authorities on a periodic basis, of which the results could impact its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n10.

The weighted average period over which the cost is expected to be recognized is approximately four months.\nRestricted and Performance Awards and Units\nThe following table represents a summary of the Companys restricted and performance awards and units:\nShares\n(in millions)\nWeighted average\ngrant date fair value\nNon-vested awards outstanding at October 1, 2021 2.7 $ 118.87\nGranted (1) 1.6 $ 151.20\nVested (1.6) $ 117.71\nCanceled/forfeited (0.3) $ 129.80\nNon-vested awards outstanding at September 30, 2022 2.4 $ 139.63\n(1) includes performance stock awards granted and earned assuming target performance under the underlying performance metrics\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value per share for awards granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, was $151.20, $148.96, and $99.68, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the total intrinsic value for awards vested (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nAwards $ 249.6 $ 167.4 $ 100.9\nValuation and Expense Information\nThe following table summarizes pre-tax share-based compensation expense by financial statement line and related tax benefit (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nCost of goods sold $ 26.9 $ 28.9 $ 23.2\nResearch and development 93.8 85.7 68.7\nSelling, general, and administrative 74.5 77.3 64.7\nTotal share-based compensation expense $ 195.2 $ 191.9 $ 156.6\nShare-based compensation tax benefit $ 20.1 $ 13.5 $ 10.3\nCapitalized share-based compensation expense at period end $ 6.8 $ 9.8 $ 10.6\nThe following table summarizes total compensation costs related to unvested share-based awards not yet recognized and the weighted-average period over which it is expected to be recognized at September 30, 2022:\nUnrecognized compensation cost for unvested awards\n(in millions) Weighted average remaining recognition period\n(in years)\nAwards $ 208.2 2.6\nThe fair value of the restricted stock units is equal to the closing market price of the Companys common stock on the date of grant.\nThe Company issued performance stock unit awards during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020 that contained market-based conditions. The fair value of these performance stock unit awards was estimated on the date of the grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following weighted average assumptions:\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nVolatility of common stock 44.04 % 43.20 % 32.22 %\nAverage volatility of peer companies 46.28 % 45.96 % 33.96 %\nAverage correlation coefficient of peer companies 0.65 0.65 0.61\nRisk-free interest rate 0.79 % 0.25 % 1.62 %\nDividend yield 1.40 % 1.39 % 1.78 %\n11. LEASES\nThe Companys lease arrangements consist primarily of corporate, manufacturing, design, and other facility agreements as well as various machinery and office equipment agreements. The leases expire at various dates through 2061, some of which include options to extend the lease term. The longest potential total lease term consists of a 40-year land lease in Osaka, Japan.\nDuring the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, the Company recorded $43.6 million, $33.9 million, and $28.1 million of operating lease expense, and $12.3 million, $3.2 million, and $7.6 million of variable lease expense, respectively.\nSupplemental cash information and non-cash activities related to operating leases are as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nOperating cash outflows from operating leases $ 32.0 $ 32.5\nOperating lease assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities $ 84.6 $ 24.8\nOperating leases are classified as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Year Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nOther current liabilities $ 18.5 $ 33.0\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 206.9 144.5\nTotal lease liabilities $ 225.4 $ 177.5\nMaturities of lease liabilities under operating leases by fiscal year are as follows (in millions):\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2023 $ 15.2\n2024 31.0\n2025 30.1\n2026 26.9\n2027 26.1\nThereafter 150.1\nTotal lease payments 279.4\nLess: imputed interest (54.0)\nPresent value of lease liabilities 225.4\nLess: current portion (included in other current liabilities) (18.5)\nTotal $ 206.9\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to operating leases are as follows:\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years) 12.1 7.5\nWeighted-average discount rate 3.3 % 3.1 %\n12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal Matters\nFrom time to time, various lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been, and may in the future be, instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to patent infringement, intellectual property, environmental hazards, product liability and warranty, safety and health, employment, and contractual matters.\nThe semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights. Third parties have asserted, and may in the future, assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to the Companys business and have demanded and may in the future demand that the Company license their technology. The outcome of any such litigation cannot be predicted with certainty and some such lawsuits, claims, or proceedings may be disposed of unfavorably to the Company. Generally speaking, intellectual property disputes often have a risk of injunctive relief, which, if imposed against the Company, could materially and adversely affect the Companys financial condition or results of operations. From time to time the Company may also be involved in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company monitors the status of legal proceedings and other contingencies on an ongoing basis to ensure loss contingencies are recognized and/or disclosed in its financial statements and footnotes. The Company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings that are reasonably possible to result in a material loss. The Company is engaged in various legal actions in the normal course of business and, while there can be no assurances, the Company believes the outcome of all pending litigation involving the Company will not have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its business or financial statements.\n13. GUARANTEES AND INDEMNITIES\nThe Company has made no significant contractual guarantees for the benefit of third parties. However, the Company generally indemnifies its customers from third-party intellectual property infringement litigation claims related to its products and, on occasion, also provides other indemnities related to product sales. In connection with certain facility leases, the Company has indemnified its lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease.\nThe Company indemnifies its directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of Delaware. The duration of the indemnities varies, and in many cases is indefinite. The indemnities to customers in connection with product sales generally are subject to limits based upon the amount of the related product sales and in many cases are subject to geographic and other restrictions. In certain instances, the Companys indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make. The Company has not recorded any liability for these indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and does not expect that such obligations will have a material adverse impact on its financial statements.\n14. EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nNet income $ 1,275.2 $ 1,498.3 $ 814.8\nWeighted average shares outstanding - basic 162.4 165.2 168.5\nDilutive effect of equity-based awards 0.9 1.8 1.4\nWeighted average shares outstanding - diluted 163.3 167.0 169.9\nNet income per share - basic $ 7.85 $ 9.07 $ 4.84\nNet income per share - diluted $ 7.81 $ 8.97 $ 4.80\nAnti-dilutive common stock equivalents 0.7 - 0.1\nBasic earnings per share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of the Companys common stock outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share includes the dilutive effect of equity-based awards that were outstanding during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, October 1, 2021, and October 2, 2020, using the treasury stock method. Shares issuable upon the vesting of performance stock awards are likewise included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share as of the date the condition(s) have been satisfied, assuming the end of the reporting period was the end of the contingency period. Certain of the Companys outstanding share-based awards, noted in the table above, were excluded because they were anti-dilutive, but they could become dilutive in the future.\n15. SEGMENT INFORMATION AND CONCENTRATIONS\nThe Company has a single reportable operating segment which designs, develops, manufactures, and markets similar proprietary semiconductor products, including intellectual property. In reaching this conclusion, management considers the definition of the chief operating decision maker (CODM), how the business is defined by the CODM, the nature of the information provided to the CODM, and how that information is used to make operating decisions, allocate resources, and assess performance. The Companys CODM is the president and chief executive officer. The results of operations provided to and analyzed by the CODM are at the consolidated level and accordingly, key resource decisions and assessment of performance are performed at the consolidated level. The Company assesses its determination of operating segments at least annually.\nDisaggregation of Revenue and Geographic Information\nThe Company presents net revenue by geographic area based upon the location of the OEMs headquarters and sales channel as it believes that doing so best depicts how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by\neconomic factors. Individually insignificant OEMs are presented based on sales region. Net revenue by geographic area is as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nUnited States $ 3,685.7 $ 3,228.1 $ 2,012.8\nChina 599.6 994.2 700.7\nTaiwan 430.4 404.2 240.4\nSouth Korea 458.2 264.5 254.6\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa 235.8 180.1 122.9\nOther Asia-Pacific 75.8 38.0 24.3\nTotal $ 5,485.5 $ 5,109.1 $ 3,355.7\nNet revenue by sales channel is as follows (in millions):\nFiscal Years Ended\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\n2021 October 2,\nDistributors $ 4,488.1 $ 4,539.7 $ 2,599.8\nDirect customers 997.4 569.4 755.9\nTotal $ 5,485.5 $ 5,109.1 $ 3,355.7\nThe Companys revenue from external customers is generated principally from the sale of semiconductor products. Accordingly, the Company considers its product offerings to be similar in nature and therefore not segregated for reporting purposes.\nNet property, plant, and equipment balances, based on the physical locations within the indicated geographic areas are as follows (in millions):\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nJapan $ 679.7 $ 598.9\nSingapore 363.3 340.0\nMexico 296.7 362.9\nUnited States 246.0 183.5\nRest of world 19.1 16.3\n$ 1,604.8 $ 1,501.6\nConcentrations\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of trade accounts receivable. Trade accounts receivable are primarily derived from sales to manufacturers of communications and consumer products and electronic component distributors. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers.\nIn fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, Apple, through sales to multiple distributors, contract manufacturers, and direct sales for multiple applications including smartphones, tablets, desktop, and notebook computers, watches and other devices, in the aggregate accounted for 58%, 59%, and 56% of the Companys net revenue, respectively.\nAt September 30, 2022, the Companys three largest accounts receivable balances comprised 79% of aggregate gross accounts receivable. This concentration was 70% at October 1, 2021, and 70% at October 2, 2020.\n16. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOther current assets consist of the following (in millions):\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nPrepaid expenses $ 242.3 $ 106.7\nOther 95.2 97.4\nTotal other current assets $ 337.5 $ 204.1\nOther current liabilities consist of the following (in millions):\nAs of\nSeptember 30,\n2022 October 1,\nAccrued customer liabilities $ 226.9 $ 119.7\nAccrued taxes 48.8 88.6\nShort-term operating lease liabilities 18.5 33.0\nOther 45.0 45.9\nTotal other current liabilities $ 339.2 $ 287.2\n17. DEBT\nDebt consists of the following (in millions, except percentages):\nAs of\nEffective Interest Rate September 30,\n2022 October 1,\n0.90% Senior Notes due 2023 1.15 % $ 500.0 $ 500.0\n1.80% Senior Notes due 2026 1.97 % 500.0 500.0\n3.00% Senior Notes due 2031 3.13 % 500.0 500.0\nTerm Loans due 2024 2.11 % 700.0 750.0\nUnamortized debt discount and issuance costs (10.9) (14.4)\nTotal debt 2,189.1 2,235.6\nLess: current portion of long-term debt 499.2 -\nTotal $ 1,689.9 $ 2,235.6\nSenior Notes\nOn May 26, 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million of its 0.90% Senior Notes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes), $500.0 million of its 1.80% Senior Notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes), and $500.0 million of its 3.00% Senior Notes due 2031 (the 2031 Notes and, together with the 2023 Notes and the 2026 Notes, the Notes). The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of its existing and future senior unsecured debt but effectively junior to any of the Companys senior secured debt to the extent of the value of collateral securing such debt, and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future obligations of the Companys subsidiaries. The Notes will mature on each respective maturity date, unless earlier redeemed in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year.\nThe Company may redeem all or a portion of the 2023 Notes at any time after June 1, 2022, and all or a portion of the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Notes at any time and from time to time prior to maturity, in whole or in part, for cash at the applicable redemption prices set forth in the respective supplemental indenture. If the Company undergoes a change of control repurchase event, as defined in the indenture governing the Notes (as supplemented, the Indenture), holders may require the Company to repurchase the Notes in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 30, 2022, the Company considered the likelihood of acceleration related to the 2026 and 2031 Notes and recorded the Notes as long-term debt. The 2023 Note has been recorded as short-term debt. The\nNotes are recorded net of discount and issuance costs, which are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of these borrowings.\nThe Indenture contains customary events of default, including failure to make required payments of principal and interest, certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency, and default in the performance or breach of any covenant or warranty contained in the Indenture or the Notes.\nTerm Credit Agreement\nOn May 21, 2021, the Company entered into a term credit agreement (the Term Credit Agreement) providing for a $1.0 billion term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility). On July 26, 2021, the Company borrowed $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of term loans (the Term Loans) under the Term Loan Facility to finance a portion of the purchase price for the Asset Purchase and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. During fiscal 2022 and 2021, the Company repaid $50.0 million and $250.0 million, respectively, of outstanding borrowings under the Term Loans. As of September 30, 2022, there were $700.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility are not currently guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries. Interest on the Term Loans is payable either monthly or quarterly elected at the Companys discretion and is based on the applicable floating interest rate, plus an applicable margin based on the Companys public debt credit ratings. The Term Loans mature on July 26, 2024, and all amounts then-outstanding under the Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable at maturity. There is no premium or penalty for prepayment.\nThe Term Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by non-guarantor subsidiaries and the creation of liens, and a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage, defined as consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the period of four consecutive quarters not to exceed a ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The Term Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, which include failure to make required payments of principal and interest, breaches of representations and warranties, changes of control or failures to pay money judgments, and certain defaults in respect of specified material indebtedness, upon the occurrence of which, among other remedies, the lenders may accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness and other obligations under the Term Credit Agreement.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn May 21, 2021, the Company entered into a revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) providing for a $750.0 million revolving credit facility (the Revolver). The proceeds of the Revolver will be used for general corporate purposes and working capital needs of the Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe Revolver provides for revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit, with sublimits for letters of credit. The Revolver may be increased in specified circumstances by up to $250.0 million at the discretion of the lenders. The Revolver matures on July 26, 2026, and all unpaid borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, are repayable at maturity.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of indebtedness by non-guarantor subsidiaries and the creation of liens, and a financial covenant consisting of a limitation on leverage, defined as consolidated total indebtedness divided by consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the period of four consecutive quarters not to exceed a ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2022, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolver. ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is\nrecorded, processed, summarized, and reported, within the time periods specified in the SECs rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the companys management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on managements evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2022, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nManagements Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Companys principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the Companys Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Companys management assessed the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, the Companys management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework.\nBased on their assessment, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2022, the Companys internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe Companys independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting as stated within their report which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nThere are no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
