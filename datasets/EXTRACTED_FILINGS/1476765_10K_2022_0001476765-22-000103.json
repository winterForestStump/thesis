    "content": "Item 1. Business\nGENERAL\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company, or RIC, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. We were formed in November 2009 to continue and expand the business of our predecessor, Golub Capital Master Funding LLC, which commenced operations in July 2007. We make investments primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies that are, in most cases, sponsored by private equity firms. GC Advisors structures these one stop loans as senior secured loans, and we obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In many cases, we are the sole lender or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of one stop loans, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance.\nIn this annual report on Form 10-K, the term middle-market generally refers to companies having earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of less than $100.0 million annually.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured and one stop loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrower's other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to middle-market companies that had over $55 billion of capital under management as of July 1, 2022, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily senior secured and one stop loans by primarily investing approximately $10.0 million to $75.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. We expect to selectively invest more than $75.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which could increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nGCIC Acquisition\nOn September 16, 2019, we completed our acquisition of GCIC, pursuant to the Merger Agreement. As a result of, and as of the effective time of, the Merger, GCICs separate existence ceased.\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GCICs common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.865 shares of our common stock (with GCICs stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock). As a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 71,779,964 shares of our common stock to former stockholders of GCIC.\nRights Offering\nOn May 15, 2020, we completed a transferable rights offering and issued a total of 33,451,902 shares of our\ncommon stock. We issued to stockholders of record on April 8, 2020 one transferable right for each four shares of our common stock held on the record date. Each holder of rights was entitled to subscribe for one share of common stock for every right held at a subscription price of $9.17 per share. Net proceeds after deducting the dealer manager\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nfees and other offering expenses were approximately $300.4 million. 3,191,448 shares of common stock were purchased in the rights offering by affiliates of GC Advisors.\nInformation Available\nOur address is 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166. Our phone number is (212) 750-6060, and our internet address is www.golubcapitalbdc.com. We make available, free of charge, on our website our proxy statement, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference into this annual report on Form 10-K and you should not consider information contained on our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K or any other report we file with the SEC.\nThe SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. Copies of these reports, proxy and information statements and other information may also be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by electronic request at publicinfo@sec.gov.\nOur Adviser\nOur investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, GC Advisors. GC Advisors is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. GC Advisors was organized in September 2008 and is a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended, or the Advisers Act. Under our amended and restated investment advisory agreement, or the Investment Advisory Agreement, with GC Advisors, we pay GC Advisors a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. See Business - Management Agreements - Management Fee for a discussion of the base management fee and incentive fee, including the cumulative income incentive fee and the income and capital gains incentive fee, payable by us to GC Advisors. Unlike most closed-end funds whose fees are based on assets net of leverage, our base management fee is based on our average-adjusted gross assets (including leverage but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) and, therefore, GC Advisors benefits when we incur debt or use leverage. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 270 days of purchase. Additionally, under the incentive fee structure, GC Advisors benefits when capital gains are recognized and, because it determines when a holding is sold, GC Advisors controls the timing of the recognition of capital gains. Our board of directors is charged with protecting our interests by monitoring how GC Advisors addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation. While not expected to review or approve each borrowing, our independent directors periodically review GC Advisors services and fees as well as its portfolio management decisions and portfolio performance. In connection with these reviews, our independent directors consider whether our fees and expenses (including those related to leverage) remain appropriate. See Business - Management Agreements - Board Approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nGC Advisors is an affiliate of Golub Capital and pursuant to a staffing agreement, or the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC makes experienced investment professionals available to GC Advisors and provides access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates. The Staffing Agreement provides GC Advisors with access to deal flow generated by Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates in the ordinary course of their businesses and commits the members of GC Advisors investment committee to serve in that capacity. As our investment adviser, GC Advisors is obligated to allocate investment opportunities among us and its other clients fairly and equitably over time in accordance with its allocation policy. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Related Party Transactions. However, there can be no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time. GC Advisors seeks to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Golub Capital LLCs investment professionals.\nOur Administrator\nGolub Capital LLC, our Administrator and an affiliate of GC Advisors, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. See Business - Management Agreements - Administration Agreement for a\nTALE OF CONTENTS\ndiscussion of the fees and expenses (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) we are required to reimburse to the Administrator.\nAbout Golub Capital\nGolub Capital, founded in 1994, is a leading lender to middle-market companies, with a long track record of investing in senior secured, one stop, second lien and subordinated loans. As of July 1, 2022, Golub Capital had over $55 billion of capital under management. Since its inception, Golub Capital has closed deals with over 360 middle-market sponsors and repeat transactions with over 250 sponsors.\nGolub Capitals middle-market lending group is managed by an eight-member senior management team consisting of Lawrence E. Golub, David B. Golub, Andrew H. Steuerman, Gregory W. Cashman, Spyro G. Alexopoulos, Marc C. Robinson, Robert G. Tuchscherer and Jason J. Van Dussen. As of September 30, 2022, Golub Capital had more than 170 investment professionals supported by more than 530 administrative and back office personnel that focus on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management.\nMarket Trends\nWe have identified the following trends that may affect our business:\nTarget Market. We believe that small and middle market companies in the United States with annual revenues between $10 million and $2.5 billion represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle market companies have generated a significant number of investment opportunities for investment funds managed or advised by Golub Capital, and we believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. We continue to focus our portfolio on borrowers in what we believe are recession resistant industries that are insulated from the effects of COVID-19.\nSpecialized Lending Requirements. We believe that several factors render many U.S. financial institutions ill-suited to lend to U.S. middle market companies. For example, based on the experience of our management team, lending to U.S. middle market companies (1) is generally more labor intensive than lending to larger companies due to the smaller size of each investment and the fragmented nature of information for such companies, (2) requires due diligence and underwriting practices consistent with the demands and economic limitations of the middle market and (3) also requires more extensive ongoing monitoring by the lender.\nDemand for Debt Capital. We believe there is a large pool of committed but uninvested private equity capital for middle market companies. We expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and subordinated debt from other sources, such as us.\nCompetition from Bank Lenders. We believe that many traditional bank lenders to middle market businesses have either exited or de-emphasized their service and product offerings in the middle market. These traditional lenders have instead focused on lending and providing other services to large corporate clients. We believe this has resulted in fewer key players and the reduced availability of debt capital to the companies we target.\nMarket Environment: We believe middle market investments are likely to excel in uncertain market environments such as the current market environment following the COVID-19 outbreak that began in December 2019, and that these investments have historically generated premium yields with more desirable structures for lenders as compared to large corporate loans.(1) In addition, we believe the recent credit market dislocation will accelerate the market share shift toward well-positioned larger platforms. On the other hand, we believe that there has been increased competition for direct lending to middle market businesses, which would be expected to result in less favorable pricing terms for our potential investments. If we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we would expect to experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. However, we believe that Golub Capitals scale, product suite, entrenched relationships and strong market position will continue to allow us to find investment opportunities with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n(1) Standard & Poors High-End Middle-Market Lending Review Q4 2021 - New-issue first-lien yield-to-maturity. Middle-Market loans have, on average, generated higher yields in comparison to large corporate loans based on data starting in June 2005.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nCompetitive Strengths\nDeep, Experienced Management Team. We are managed by GC Advisors, which has access through the Staffing Agreement to the resources and expertise of Golub Capitals more than 725 employees, led by our chairman, Lawrence E. Golub, and our chief executive officer, David B. Golub. As of September 30, 2022, Golub Capitals more than 170 investment professionals had an average of over 13 years of investment experience and were supported by more than 530 administrative and back office personnel that focus on operations, finance, legal and compliance, accounting and reporting, marketing, information technology and office management. GC Advisors also manages (i) Golub Capital BDC 3, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or GBDC 3; (ii) Golub Capital Direct Lending Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLC; (iii) Golub Capital BDC 4, Inc., a Maryland corporation, or GBDC4; and (iv) Golub Capital Direct Lending Unlevered Corporation, a Maryland corporation, or GDLCU, each of which has elected to be regulated as a business development company, have investment mandates similar to ours, and primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. Golub Capital seeks to hire and retain high-quality investment professionals and reward those personnel based on investor returns.\nLeading U.S. Debt Platform Provides Access to Proprietary Relationship-Based Deal Flow. GC Advisors gives us access to the deal flow of Golub Capital, one of the leading middle-market lenders in the United States. Golub Capital has been a top 3 Traditional Middle Market Bookrunner each year from 2008 through 2022 for senior secured loans of up to $500.0 million for leveraged buyouts based on number of deals completed according to Thomson Reuters LPC and internal data. We believe this market position makes Golub Capital the first choice lender to many sponsors. Since its inception, Golub Capital has closed deals with over 360 middle-market sponsors and repeat transactions with over 250 sponsors. We believe that Golub Capital receives relationship-based early looks and last looks at many investment opportunities in the U.S. middle-market market, allowing it to be highly selective in the transactions it pursues.\nDisciplined Investment and Underwriting Process. GC Advisors utilizes the established investment process of Golub Capital for reviewing lending opportunities, structuring transactions and monitoring investments. Using its disciplined approach to lending, GC Advisors seeks to minimize credit losses through effective underwriting, comprehensive due diligence investigations, structuring and the implementation of restrictive debt covenants. We expect that GC Advisors will continue to select borrowers whose businesses will retain significant value, even in a depressed market or a distressed sale. GC Advisors intends to reduce risk further by focusing on repeat transactions with proven, successful sponsors. While emphasizing thorough credit analysis, GC Advisors intends to maintain strong relationships with sponsors by offering rapid initial feedback from senior investment professionals on each investment opportunity.\nRegimented Credit Monitoring. Following each investment, GC Advisors implements a regimented credit monitoring system. This careful approach, which involves ongoing review and analysis by teams of professionals, has enabled GC Advisors to identify problems early and to assist borrowers before they face difficult liquidity constraints. If necessary, GC Advisors can assume the role of deal sponsor in a work-out situation and has extensive restructuring experience, both in and out of bankruptcy. GC Advisors believes in the need to prepare for possible negative contingencies in order to address them promptly should they arise.\nConcentrated Middle-Market Focus. Because of our focus on the middle-market, we understand the following general characteristics of middle-market lending:\nmiddle-market companies are generally less leveraged than large companies and, we believe, offer more attractive investment returns in the form of upfront fees, prepayment penalties and higher interest rates;\nmiddle-market issuers are more likely to have simple capital structures;\ncarefully structured covenant packages enable middle-market lenders to take early action to remediate poor financial performance; and\nmiddle-market lenders can undertake thorough due diligence investigations prior to investment.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nInvestment Criteria/Guidelines\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in senior secured and one stop loans to U.S. middle market companies in industries we believe are resistant to recessions. We seek to generate strong risk-adjusted net returns by assembling a portfolio of investments across a broad range of industries and private equity investors.\nWe primarily target U.S. middle-market companies controlled by private equity investors that require capital for growth, acquisitions, recapitalizations, refinancings and leveraged buyouts. We seek to have a portfolio of first-lien, senior secured loans to borrowers believed to be insulated from the effects of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, pandemic in recession-resistant industries. We also make opportunistic loans to independently owned and publicly held middle-market companies. We seek to partner with strong management teams executing long-term growth strategies. Target businesses will typically exhibit some or all of the following characteristics:\nannual EBITDA of less than $100.0 million;\nsustainable leading positions in their respective markets;\nscalable revenues and operating cash flow;\nexperienced management teams with successful track records;\ninsulation from the effects of economic disruptions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\nstable, predictable cash flows with low technology and market risks;\na substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior to our investment provided by a middle market private equity sponsor;\nlow capital expenditures requirements;\na North American base of operations;\nstrong customer relationships;\nproducts, services or distribution channels having distinctive competitive advantages;\ndefensible niche strategy or other barriers to entry; and\ndemonstrated growth strategies.\nWhile we believe that the criteria listed above are important in identifying and investing in prospective portfolio companies, not all of these criteria will be met by each prospective portfolio company.\nInvestment Process Overview\nWe view our investment process as consisting of four distinct phases described below:\nOrigination. GC Advisors sources investment opportunities through access to a network of over 10,000 individual contacts developed in the financial services and related industries by Golub Capital and managed through a proprietary customer relationship database. Among these contacts is an extensive network of private equity firms and relationships with leading middle-market senior lenders. The senior deal professionals of Golub Capital supplement these leads through personal visits and marketing campaigns. It is their responsibility to identify specific opportunities, to refine opportunities through candid exploration of the underlying facts and circumstances and to apply creative and flexible thinking to solve clients financing needs. The investment professionals of Golub Capital have a long and successful track record investing in companies across many industry sectors. Collectively, these investment professionals have completed investments in over 2,200 companies at Golub Capital. Golub Capitals investments have been made in the following industries, among others: healthcare, restaurant and retail, software, digital and technology services, specialty manufacturing, business services, consumer products and services, food and beverages, aerospace and defense and value-added distribution.\nGolub Capital has principal lending offices in Chicago, New York, London and San Francisco. Each of Golub Capital's originators maintains long-standing customer relationships and is responsible for covering a specified target market. We believe those originators strength and breadth of relationships across a wide range of markets generate numerous financing opportunities, which we believe enables GC Advisors to be highly selective in recommending investments to us.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nUnderwriting. We utilize the systematic, consistent approach to underwriting developed by Golub Capital, with a particular focus on determining the value of a business in a downside scenario. The key criteria that we consider include (1) strong and resilient underlying business fundamentals, (2) a substantial equity cushion in the form of capital ranking junior in right of payment to our investment and (3) a conclusion that overall downside risk is manageable. While the size of this equity cushion will vary over time and across industries, the equity cushion generally sought by GC Advisors today is between 35% and 45% of total portfolio capitalization. We generally focus on the criteria developed by Golub Capital for evaluating prospective portfolio companies, which uses a combination of analyses, including (1) fundamental analysis of a businesss financial statements, health, management, competitive advantages, competitors and markets; (2) analysis of opportunities in a given market based upon fluctuations due to seasonal, financial and economic factors; (3) quantitative analysis of the relative risk-return characteristics of investments and a comparison of yields between asset classes and other indicators; and (4) analysis of proprietary and secondary models. In evaluating a particular company, we put more emphasis on credit considerations (such as (1) loan-to-value ratio (which is the amount of our loan divided by the enterprise value of the company in which we are investing), (2) the ability of the company to maintain a liquidity cushion through economic cycles and in downside scenarios, (3) the ability of the company to service its fixed charge obligations under a variety of scenarios and (4) its anticipated strategic value in a downturn) than on profit potential and loan pricing. Based upon a combination of bottom-up analysis of the individual investment and GC Advisors expectations of future market conditions, GC Advisors seeks to assess the relative risk and reward for each investment. GC Advisors seeks to mitigate the risks of a single company or single industry through portfolio diversification. GC Advisors also considers environmental, social and governance considerations in the investment decision-making process, in accordance with its ESG policy, including analysis of the likelihood of material ESG-related risk based on the industry and industry subsector of the potential portfolio company, with further diligence and analysis based on this categorization as well as other factors identified during diligence. Golub Capitals due diligence process for middle market credits will typically entail:\na thorough review of historical and pro forma financial information;\non-site visits;\ninterviews with management and employees;\na review of loan documents and material contracts;\nthird-party quality of earnings accounting due diligence;\nwhen appropriate, background checks on key managers and research relating to the companys business, industry, markets, customers, suppliers, products and services and competitors; and\nthe commission of third-party market studies when appropriate.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nThe following chart illustrates the stages of Golub Capitals evaluation and underwriting process:\nILLUSTRATIVE DEAL EVALUATION PROCESS\nExecution. In executing transactions for us, GC Advisors utilizes the due diligence process developed by Golub Capital. Through a consistent approach to underwriting and careful attention to the details of execution, Golub Capital seeks to maintain discipline with respect to credit, pricing, and structure to ensure the ultimate success of the financing. Upon completion of due diligence, the investment team working on an investment delivers a final memorandum to GC Advisors investment committee. Once an investment has been approved by the investment committee, it moves through a series of steps generally, including initial documentation using standard document templates, final documentation, including resolution of business points and the execution of original documents held in escrow. Upon completion of final documentation, a loan is funded upon the execution of an investment committee memorandum by members of GC Advisors investment committee.\nMonitoring. We view active portfolio monitoring as a vital part of our investment process. We consider board observation rights, where appropriate, regular dialogue with company management and sponsors and detailed, internally generated monitoring reports to be critical to our performance. Golub Capital has developed a monitoring template that is designed to reasonably ensure compliance with these standards. This template is used by GC Advisors as a tool to assess investment performance relative to our plan. In addition, our portfolio companies often rely on GC Advisors to provide them with financial and capital markets expertise.\nAs part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings:\nInternal Performance Ratings\nRating Definition\n5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.\n4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.\n3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due.\n2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).\n1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nOur internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nFor any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors increases its monitoring intensity and prepares regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions.\nGC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nInternal\nPerformance\nRating Investments\nat Fair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments Investments\nat Fair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n5 $ 252,572 4.6 $ 499,241 10.2\n4 4,725,988 86.8 3,951,870 80.7\n3 398,625 7.3 395,208 8.1\n2 69,171 1.3 47,836 1.0\n1 - - 731 0.0*\nTotal $ 5,446,356 100.0 $ 4,894,886 100.0\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nInvestment Committee\nThe purpose of GC Advisors investment committee, which is comprised of officers of GC Advisors, is to evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject to the oversight of our board of directors. The investment committee process is intended to bring the diverse experience and perspectives of the committees members to the analysis and consideration of each investment. The investment committee currently consists of Lawrence E. Golub, David B. Golub, Andrew H. Steuerman, Gregory W. Cashman, Spyro G. Alexopoulos, Marc C. Robinson, Robert G. Tuchscherer and Jason J. Van Dussen. The investment committee serves to provide investment consistency and adherence to our core investment philosophy and policies. The investment committee also determines appropriate investment sizing and suggests ongoing monitoring requirements.\nIn addition to reviewing investments, investment committee meetings serve as a forum to discuss credit views and outlooks. Potential transactions and deal flow are reviewed on a regular basis. Members of the investment team are encouraged to share information and credit views with the investment committee early in their analysis. We believe this process improves the quality of the analysis and assists the deal team members to work more efficiently.\nEach transaction is presented to the investment committee in a formal written report. Each investment opportunity generally receives the unanimous approval of the investment committee. Each member of the investment committee performs a similar role for other investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles, collectively referred to as accounts, sponsored or managed by Golub Capital and its affiliates.\nInvestment Structure\nOnce GC Advisors determines that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, GC Advisors typically works with the private equity sponsor, if applicable, the management of that company and its other capital providers to structure our investment. GC Advisors negotiates with these parties to agree on how our investment should be structured relative to other capital in the portfolio companys capital structure.\nGC Advisors structures our investments, which typically have maturities of three to seven years, as follows:\nSenior Secured Loans. GC Advisors structures investments in senior secured loans, where we obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. Our senior secured\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nloans often provide for moderate loan amortization in the early years of the loan, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our senior secured loans may include a payment in kind, or PIK, feature.\nOne Stop Loans. GC Advisors structures our one stop loans as senior secured loans. A one stop loan is a single loan that blends the characteristics of traditional senior debt and traditional junior debt. The structure generally combines the stronger lender protections associated with first lien senior secured debt with the superior economics of junior capital. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral often takes the form of first-priority liens on the assets of the portfolio company. In some cases, one stop loans are provided to borrowers experiencing high revenue growth supported by a high level of discretionary expenditures. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses if appropriate. One stop loans typically provide for moderate loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity. Our one stop loans may include a PIK feature. One stop loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity. In many cases, we are the sole lender or we, together with our affiliates, are the sole lenders of a one stop loan, which can afford us additional influence over the borrower in terms of monitoring and, if necessary, remediating any underperformance.\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans.1 Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrowers high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate.\nSecond Lien Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as subordinated, secured loans for which our claims on the related collateral are subordinated. We obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio company that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of such loans. This collateral typically takes the form of second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. Second lien loans typically provide for minimal loan amortization in the initial years of the facility, with the majority of the amortization deferred until loan maturity.\nSubordinated Loans. GC Advisors structures these investments as unsecured, subordinated loans that provide for relatively high, fixed interest rates and provide us with significant current interest income. These loans typically have interest-only payments (often representing a combination of cash pay and PIK interest) in the early years, with all or the majority of amortization of principal deferred until loan maturity. Subordinated loans generally allow the borrower to make a large lump sum payment of principal at the end of the loan term, and there is a risk of loss if the borrower is unable to pay the lump sum or refinance the amount owed at maturity.\nSecond lien loans and subordinated loans are generally more volatile than first lien, senior secured loans and involve a greater risk of loss of principal. In addition, the PIK feature of many subordinated loans, which effectively operates as negative amortization of loan principal, increases credit risk exposure over the life of the loan. Subordinated loans are more likely to include a PIK feature.\nEquity Investments. GC Advisors structures these investments as direct or indirect minority equity co-investments in a portfolio company, usually on terms similar to the controlling private equity sponsor and in connection with our loan to such portfolio company. As a result, if a portfolio company appreciates in value, we can achieve additional investment return from these equity co-investments. GC Advisors can structure these equity co-investments to include provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, which could include a put, or right to sell such securities back to the issuer, upon the occurrence of specified events or demand and piggyback registration rights. However, because these equity co-investments will typically be in private companies, there is no guarantee that we, as a minority-interest holder, will control the timing or value of our realization of any gains on such investments.\n1 As of November 10, 2022, we have updated terminology from late stage lending to recurring revenue to better reflect the commercial activity of our business.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nOur equity co-investments will typically include customary tag-along and/or drag-along rights that will permit or require us to participate in a sale of such equity co-investments at such time as the majority owners, not GC Advisors, determine.\nGC Advisors tailors the terms of each investment to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its operating results. GC Advisors seeks to limit the downside potential of our investments by:\nselecting investments that we believe have a very low probability of loss;\nrequiring a total return on our investments that we believe will compensate us appropriately for credit risk; and\nnegotiating covenants in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies as much flexibility in managing their businesses as possible, consistent with the preservation of our capital. Such restrictions could include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights.\nWe expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell some of our investments earlier if a liquidity event occurs, such as a sale, recapitalization or worsening of the credit quality of the portfolio company.\nInvestments\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by investing approximately $10.0 million to $75.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies. Set forth below is a list of our ten largest portfolio company investments as of September 30, 2022, as well as the top ten industries in which we were invested as of September 30, 2022, calculated as a percentage of our total investments at fair value as of such date.\nPortfolio Company Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\nGS Acquisitionco, Inc. $ 112,510 2.1 %\nDiligent Corporation 111,803 2.0\nElectrical Source Holdings, LLC 101,091 1.8\nInhabit IQ Inc. 82,274 1.5\nBullhorn, Inc. 81,359 1.5\nImperial Optical Midco Inc. 80,432 1.5\nTWAS Holdings, LLC 79,956 1.5\nGTIV, LLC 72,726 1.3\nBayshore Intermediate #2, L.P. 68,898 1.3\nTransaction Data Systems, Inc. 64,949 1.2\n$ 855,998 15.7 %\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nIndustry Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal Investments\nSoftware $ 1,401,424 25.7 %\nHealthcare Providers and Services 444,736 8.2\nSpecialty Retail 367,521 6.7\nAutomobiles 260,506 4.8\nIT Services 249,240 4.6\nDiversified Consumer Services 236,896 4.3\nInsurance 226,158 4.2\nHealth Care Technology 200,658 3.7\nPharmaceuticals 150,263 2.8\nElectronic Equipment, Instruments and Components 138,011 2.5\n$ 3,675,413 67.5 %\nManagerial Assistance\nAs a business development company, we offer, and must provide upon request, managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. The Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator provides such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance. We could receive fees for these services and reimburse the Administrator or an affiliate of the Administrator, as applicable, for its allocated costs in providing such assistance, subject to the review and approval by our board of directors, including our independent directors.\nCompetition\nOur primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company or to the source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC.\nWe use the expertise of the investment professionals of Golub Capital and its affiliates to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, the relationships of the senior members of Golub Capital and its affiliates enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we invest. See Risk Factors - Risks Relating to our Business and Structure - We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.\nAdministration\nWe do not have any direct employees, and our day-to-day investment operations are managed by GC Advisors. Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of our board of directors. We have a chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, managing director and director of corporate strategy, and to the extent necessary, our board of directors can elect to appoint additional officers going forward. Our officers are officers and/or employees of Golub Capital LLC, an affiliate of GC Advisors, and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs is paid by us pursuant to the administration agreement, or the Administration Agreement, with the Administrator. See Business - Management Agreements - Administration Agreement.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nSUMMARY RISK FACTORS\nThe risk factors described below are a summary of the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us. These are not the only risks we face. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other reports and documents filed by us with the SEC. The risks set out below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us could also impair our operations and performance. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. In such case, our net asset value and the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risk factors described below are the principal risk factors associated with an investment in us as well as those factors generally associated with an investment company with investment objectives, investment policies, capital structure or trading markets similar to ours.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Structure\nWe are subject to risks associated with the current interest rate environment and to the extent we use debt to finance our investments, changes in interest rates will affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nTo the extent we borrow money or issue debt securities or preferred stock to make investments, our net investment income will depend, in part, upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds or pay interest or dividends on such debt securities or preferred stock and the rate at which we invest these funds. In addition, many of our debt investments and borrowings have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis, and many of our investments are subject to interest rate floors. As a result, a change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds will increase because the interest rates on the amounts borrowed under our credit facilities or certain other financing arrangements are typically floating, which could reduce our net investment income to the extent any debt investments have fixed interest rates, and the interest rate on investments with an interest rate floor above current levels will not increase until interest rates exceed the applicable floor.\nWe can use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Such techniques could include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. These activities could limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the hedged borrowings. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nYou should also be aware that a rise in the general level of interest rates typically will lead to higher interest rates applicable to our debt investments, which could result in an increase of the amount of incentive fees payable to GC Advisors. In addition, a decline in the prices of the debt we own could adversely affect our net asset value. Also, an increase in interest rates available to investors could make an investment in our common stock less attractive if we are not able to increase our distribution rate, which could reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.\nA number of entities compete with us to make the types of investments that we plan to make, and we believe that recent market trends, including sustained periods of low interest rates, have increased the number of competitors seeking to invest in loans to private, middle-market companies in the United States. We compete with public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some of our competitors could have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors could have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a business development company or the source of income, asset diversification and distribution requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC. The competitive pressures we face could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of this competition, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities that arise from time to time, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our investment objective.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nAn excess of the amount of capital in the private debt markets and overall competition for loans could result in short term returns for us that are lower than our long-term targets. In the event these conditions continue for an extended amount of time, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIdentifying, structuring and consummating investments involves competition among capital providers and market and transaction uncertainty. GC Advisors can provide no assurance that it will be able to identify a sufficient number of suitable investment opportunities or to avoid prepayment of existing investments to satisfy our investment objectives, including as necessary to effectively structure credit facilities or other forms of leverage.\nThe loan origination market is very competitive, which can result in loan terms that are more favorable to borrowers, and conversely less favorable to lenders, such as lower interest rates and fees, weaker borrower financial and other covenants, borrower rights to cure defaults, and other terms more favorable to borrowers than current or historical norms. Increased competition could cause us to make more loans that are cov-lite in nature and, in a distressed scenario, there can be no assurance that these loans will retain the same value as loans with a full package of covenants. As a result of these conditions, the market for leveraged loans could become less advantageous than expected for us, and this could increase default rates, decrease recovery rates or otherwise harm our returns. The risk of prepayment is also higher in the current competitive environment if borrowers are offered more favorable terms by other lenders. The financial markets have experienced substantial fluctuations in prices and liquidity for leveraged loans. Any further disruption in the credit and other financial markets could have substantial negative effects on general economic conditions, the availability of required capital for companies and the operating performance of such companies. These conditions also could result in increased default rates and credit downgrades, and affect the liquidity and pricing of the investments made by us. Conversely, periods of economic stability and increased competition among capital providers could increase the difficulty of locating investments that are desirable for us.\nWith respect to the investments we make, we do not seek to compete based primarily on the interest rates we offer, and we believe that some of our competitors could make loans with interest rates that will be lower than the rates we offer. In the secondary market for acquiring existing loans, we compete generally on the basis of pricing terms. With respect to all investments, we could lose some investment opportunities if we do not match our competitors pricing, terms and structure. However, if we match our competitors pricing, terms and structure, we could experience decreased net interest income, lower yields and increased risk of credit loss. We will also compete for investment opportunities with accounts managed or sponsored by GC Advisors or its affiliates. Although GC Advisors allocates opportunities in accordance with its allocation policy, allocations to such other accounts will reduce the amount and frequency of opportunities available to us and thus not necessarily be in the best interests of us and our securityholders. Moreover, the performance of investments will not be known at the time of allocation.\nRising interest rates could affect the value of our investments and make it more difficult for portfolio companies to make periodic payments on their loans.\nInterest rate risk refers to the risk of market changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes affect the value of debt. In general, rising interest rates will negatively impact the price of fixed rate debt, and falling interest rates will have a positive effect on price. Adjustable rate debt also reacts to interest rate changes in a similar manner, although generally to a lesser degree. Interest rate sensitivity is generally larger and less predictable in debt with uncertain payment or prepayment schedules. Further, rising interest rates make it more difficult for borrowers to repay debt, which could increase the risk of payment defaults. Any failure of one or more portfolio companies to repay or refinance its debt at or prior to maturity or the inability of one or more portfolio companies to make ongoing payments following an increase in contractual interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR, which will affect our cost of capital and net investment income.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, announced its intention to cease sustaining the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, by the end of 2021.\nAs of January 1, 2022, USD LIBOR is available in five settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month). The ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) has stated that it will cease to publish all remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following their publication on June 30, 2023. As of January 1, 2022, all non-USD LIBOR reference rates in all settings ceased to be published.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nIn April 2018, the New York Federal Reserve Bank began publishing its alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. The Bank of England followed suit in April 2018 by publishing its proposed alternative rate, the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA. Each of SOFR and SONIA significantly differ from LIBOR, both in the actual rate and how it is calculated, and therefore it is unclear whether and when markets will adopt either of these rates as a widely accepted replacement for LIBOR.\nAs such, when LIBOR is discontinued, if a replacement rate is not widely agreed upon or if a replacement rate is significantly different from LIBOR, it could cause a disruption in the credit markets generally. Such a disruption could also negatively impact the market value and/or transferability of our portfolio company investments. Furthermore, disruptions related to loans and/or other debt financing securitizations (CLOs) in the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on the ability of GC Advisors or its affiliates to enter into loans in the future in accordance with our investment strategy and have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be materially and adversely impacted to the extent GC Advisors or its affiliates are unable to successfully implement an acceptable replacement rate in leverage utilized by us or if there is a prolonged period of mismatch on the interest rates payable on our leverage and our portfolio investments as a result of the discontinued publication of LIBOR results in a decrease in our net investment income and distributions we are able to pay to our stockholders.\nWe are dependent upon GC Advisors for our success and upon its access to the investment professionals and partners of Golub Capital and its affiliates.\nWe do not have any internal management capacity or employees. We rely on GC Advisors to manage and conduct our affairs and make all investment decisions. Subject to the oversight of our board of directors, GC Advisors has sole discretion in originating, structuring, negotiating, purchasing, financing and eventually divesting our investments, and our investors will not be able to evaluate for themselves the merits of particular investments prior to us making such investments. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the senior investment professionals of GC Advisors to achieve our investment objective. GC Advisors investment committee, which consists of two members of our board of directors and additional employees of Golub Capital LLC, provides oversight over our investment activities. We also cannot assure you that we will replicate the historical results achieved by members of the investment committee, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved by them in prior periods. We expect that GC Advisors will evaluate, negotiate, structure, close and monitor our investments in accordance with the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement. We can offer no assurance, however, that the senior investment professionals of GC Advisors will continue to provide investment advice to us. If these individuals do not maintain their existing relationships with Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates and do not develop new relationships with other sources of investment opportunities, we can provide no assurance that GC Advisors or its affiliates will be able to identify appropriate replacements or grow our investment portfolio. The loss of any member of GC Advisors investment committee or of other senior investment professionals of GC Advisors and its affiliates would limit our ability to achieve our investment objective and operate as we anticipate. This could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC makes available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provides access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. We are not a party to the Staffing Agreement and cannot assure you that Golub Capital LLC will fulfill its obligations under the agreement. If Golub Capital LLC fails to perform, we cannot assure you that GC Advisors will enforce the Staffing Agreement, that such agreement will not be terminated by either party or that we will continue to have access to the investment professionals of Golub Capital LLC and its affiliates or their information and deal flow.\nOur business model depends to a significant extent upon strong referral relationships with sponsors and investing in companies backed by private equity sponsors. Any inability of GC Advisors to maintain or develop these relationships, or the failure of these relationships to generate investment opportunities, could adversely affect our business.\nGC Advisors is highly dependent on relationships with private equity sponsors in connection with the sourcing of investments. If private equity sponsors find new sources of debt capital that are more advantageous to them, or if GC Advisors suffers reputational harm such that it becomes a less attractive source of capital for private equity sponsors, GC Advisors could have difficulty finding and sourcing new middle-market debt investments. Private equity sponsors could experience financial distress, which could be related or unrelated to the portfolio companies to which we have exposure. Once in financial distress, such sponsors likely would be unable to provide the same level of\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nmanagerial, operating or financial support to such portfolio companies, resulting in an increased risk of default or inability to repay remaining principal at maturity.\nFrom time to time, we expect to have direct or indirect exposure to companies controlled by private equity sponsors in which the sponsors have completed one or more dividend recapitalizations, thereby allowing the private equity sponsor to substantially reduce or eliminate its net investment in an underlying portfolio company. These investments generally present different investment characteristics to us than investments where a private equity sponsor retains a significant net contributed capital position in the company. These investments could experience a higher rate of default. Even when a default does not occur, private equity sponsors could be less willing to provide ongoing financial, managerial or operating support to a portfolio company after it has received one or more capital distributions on its investment.\nWe believe that purchase price multiples of companies (as measured by the price paid by a private equity sponsor to purchase a company divided by the companys trailing twelve-month earnings) to which we have direct or indirect exposure are close to all-time highs. When considering the appropriate amount of financing to provide a prospective borrower, GC Advisors considers the value cushion as measured by the difference between the enterprise value of the company and the total amount of financing. If market purchase price multiples decline or if a portfolio company experiences financial distress, the value cushion supporting our investment could deteriorate and the investment could become impaired, resulting in losses for us. The risk of such losses for us are greater during periods when purchase price multiples are close to all-time highs.\nWe can provide no assurance that we will be able to replicate the historical results achieved by other entities managed or sponsored by members of GC Advisors investment committee, or by GC Advisors or its affiliates.\nInvestors are cautioned that past investment performance of similar portfolios and other investment vehicles managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates is not indicative of how we will perform. Our investments could differ from some existing accounts and funds that are or have been sponsored or managed by members of GC Advisors investment committee, GC Advisors or affiliates of GC Advisors. Investors in our securities are not acquiring an interest in any accounts that are or have been sponsored or managed by members of GC Advisors investment committee, GC Advisors or affiliates of GC Advisors. We often co-invest in portfolio investments with other accounts sponsored or managed by members of GC Advisors investment committee, GC Advisors or its affiliates. Such investments are subject to regulatory limitations and approvals by directors who are not interested persons, as defined in the 1940 Act. We can offer no assurance, however, that we will obtain such approvals or develop opportunities that comply with such limitations. We also cannot assure you that we will replicate the historical results achieved by us or by members of the investment committee, and we caution you that our investment returns could be substantially lower than the returns achieved in prior periods. Additionally, all or a portion of the prior results were achieved in particular market conditions that might never be repeated. Moreover, current or future market volatility and regulatory uncertainty can have an adverse impact on our future performance.\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows depend on our ability to manage our business effectively.\nOur ability to achieve our investment objective depends on our ability to manage our business and to grow. This depends, in turn, on GC Advisors ability to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria. The achievement of our investment objectives on a cost-effective basis depends upon GC Advisors execution of our investment process, its ability to provide competent, attentive and efficient services to us and, to a lesser extent, our access to financing on acceptable terms. GC Advisors has substantial responsibilities under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as well as responsibilities in connection with the management of other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors, members of GC Advisors investment committee or Golub Capital LLC. The personnel of the Administrator and its affiliates could be called upon to provide managerial assistance to our portfolio companies. These activities could distract them or slow our rate of investment. Any failure to manage our business and our future growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are significant potential conflicts of interest as a result of our arrangements with GC Advisors and its affiliates and GC Advisors investment committee that could affect our investment returns.\nAs a result of our arrangements with GC Advisors and its affiliates and GC Advisors investment committee, there will be times when GC Advisors or such persons have interests that differ from those of our security holders, giving rise to a conflict of interest, many of which are described in the following risk factors. GC Advisors attempts to\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nidentify, monitor and mitigate conflicts of interest. Further, GC Advisors has implemented policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure its clients are treated fairly and equitably over time. GC Advisors believes that these factors, together with Golub Capitals commitment to put investors first, effectively mitigate the risks associated with such conflicts of interest. However, it can be difficult to ensure that conflicts of interest do not adversely affect us.\nThere are conflicts related to the obligations of GC Advisors investment committee, GC Advisors or its affiliates have to other clients and conflicts related to fees and expenses of such other clients.\nThe members of GC Advisors investment committee serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as we do or of accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates. Currently, our directors and certain of our officers also serve as directors and officers of GBDC 3, GDLC, GBDC 4 and GDLCU, each a closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has also elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. Similarly, GC Advisors and its affiliates manage other clients with similar or competing investment objectives.\nGC Advisors management team will share its time and attention between us and other investment vehicles and accounts. Neither we nor any investor in us unaffiliated with GC Advisors will have any rights in or to independent ventures of GC Advisors or its affiliates or in the income or profits derived therefrom. GC Advisors does not expect to have any dedicated personnel who spend all or substantially all of their time managing our investing activities.\nIn serving in these multiple capacities, GC Advisors and its personnel have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which could conflict with the best interests of us or our stockholders. Economic disruption and uncertainty precipitated by certain events, including for example the COVID-19 pandemic, could require GC Advisors and its affiliates to devote additional time and focus to existing portfolio companies in which other funds and accounts managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates hold investments. The allocation of time and focus by personnel of GC Advisors and its affiliates to existing portfolio company investments held by other funds and accounts could reduce the time that such individuals have to spend on our investing activities.\nOur investment objective overlaps with the investment objectives of other affiliated accounts. For example, GC Advisors and its affiliates currently manage GBDC 3, GDLC, GBDC 4, GDLCU and multiple private funds and separate accounts that pursue an investment strategy similar to ours, some of which will seek additional capital from time to time. We compete with these and other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates for capital and investment opportunities. As a result, GC Advisors and its affiliates face conflicts in the allocation of investment opportunities among us and other accounts advised by or affiliated with GC Advisors and, in certain circumstances, in the timing of the sale of an investment. Certain of these accounts provide for higher management or incentive fees, allow GC Advisors to recover greater expense reimbursements or overhead allocations, and/or permit GC Advisors and its affiliates to receive higher origination and other transaction fees, all of which could contribute to this conflict of interest and create an incentive for GC Advisors to favor such other accounts. For example, the 1940 Act restricts GC Advisors from receiving more than a 1% fee in connection with loans that we acquire, or originate, a limitation that does not exist for certain other accounts. GC Advisors seeks to allocate investment opportunities among eligible accounts in a manner that is fair and equitable over time and consistent with its allocation policy. However, we can offer no assurance that such opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to participate in all investment opportunities that are suitable to us. Furthermore, because allocations under GC Advisors allocation policy are based on total capital of the relevant investing funds, including us, we expect to receive smaller allocations relative to larger accounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows during such ramp-up period. With respect to the sale of investments, the sale of an investment by one account advised by GC Advisors or its affiliates could potentially adversely affect the market value of the interests in such investment that continue to be held by other accounts, including us.\nGC Advisors investment committee, GC Advisors or its affiliates could, from time to time, possess material non-public information, limiting our investment discretion.\nPrincipals of GC Advisors and its affiliates and members of GC Advisors investment committee could serve as directors of, or in a similar capacity with, companies in which we invest, the securities of which are purchased or sold on our behalf. In the event that material non-public information is obtained with respect to such companies, or we become subject to trading restrictions under the internal trading policies of those companies or as a result of applicable law or regulations, we could be prohibited for a period of time from purchasing or selling the securities of such companies, and this prohibition could have an adverse effect on us.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nOur management and incentive fee structure creates incentives for GC Advisors that are not fully aligned with the interests of our stockholders and could induce GC Advisors to make certain investments, including speculative investments.\nIn the course of our investing activities, we pay management and incentive fees to GC Advisors. The management fee is based on our average adjusted gross assets and the incentive fee is computed and paid on income and capital gains, both of which include leverage. As a result, investors in our common stock will invest on a gross basis and receive distributions on a net basis after expenses, resulting in a lower rate of return than one could achieve through direct investments. Because these fees are based on the fair value of our average adjusted gross assets, GC Advisors benefits when we incur debt or use leverage. The use of leverage increases the likelihood of default on our debt or other leverage, which would disfavor our securityholders.\nAdditionally, the incentive fee payable by us to GC Advisors could create an incentive for GC Advisors to cause us to realize capital gains or losses that are not in the best interests of us or our stockholders. Under the incentive fee structure, GC Advisors benefits when we recognize capital gains and, because GC Advisors determines when an investment is sold, GC Advisors controls the timing of the recognition of such capital gains. Our board of directors is charged with protecting our stockholders interests by monitoring how GC Advisors addresses these and other conflicts of interest associated with its management services and compensation.\nThe part of the management and incentive fees payable to GC Advisors that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that includes interest income that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends, zero coupon securities, and other deferred interest instruments. This compensation arrangement creates an incentive for GC Advisors to make investments on our behalf that are riskier or more speculative, including debt financings that provide for deferred interest, rather than current cash payments of interest. Under these investments, we accrue the interest over the life of the investment but do not receive the cash income from the investment until the end of the term. Our net investment income used to calculate the income portion of our investment fee, however, includes accrued interest. GC Advisors has an incentive to invest in deferred interest securities in circumstances where it would not have done so but for the opportunity to continue to earn the fees even when the issuers of the deferred interest securities would not be able to make actual cash payments to us on such securities. This risk could be increased because GC Advisors is not obligated to reimburse us for any fees received even if we subsequently incur losses or never receive in cash the deferred income that was previously accrued.\nOur securities could be purchased by GC Advisors or its affiliates.\nAffiliates of GC Advisors have purchased, and GC Advisors and its affiliates in the future expect to purchase, certain of our securities. The purchase of our securities, including shares of our common stock, by GC Advisors and its affiliates could create certain risks. For example, GC Advisors and its affiliates could have an interest in disposing of our securities at a date that differs from that of our other investors so as to recover their investment in such securities.\nThe valuation process for certain of our portfolio holdings creates a conflict of interest.\nThe majority of our portfolio investments are in the form of securities that are not publicly traded. As a result, our board of directors determines the fair value of these securities in good faith. Valuations of private investments and private companies require judgment, are inherently uncertain, often fluctuate and are frequently based on estimates. It is possible that determinations of fair value will differ materially from the values that would have been used if an active market for these investments existed. If determinations regarding the fair value of investments were materially higher than the values that were ultimately realized upon the sale of such investments, the returns to our investors would be adversely affected.\nIn connection with that determination, investment professionals from GC Advisors will provide our board of directors with portfolio company valuations based upon the most recent portfolio company financial statements available and projected financial results of each portfolio company. The participation of GC Advisors investment professionals in our valuation process, and the indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors by Lawrence E. Golub and David B. Golub, results in a conflict of interest as GC Advisors management fee is based, in part, on our average adjusted gross assets and our capital gain and subordinated liquidation incentive fees are based, in part, on unrealized gains and losses.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nConflicts related to other arrangements with GC Advisors or its affiliates.\nWe have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, under which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital. See Management Agreements - License Agreement. In addition, we pay to the Administrator our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, such as rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. These arrangements create conflicts of interest, including in the allocation of expenses and the enforcement of the respective agreements, that our board of directors must monitor.\nOur ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates will be restricted, which could limit the scope of investments available to us.\nWe are prohibited under the 1940 Act from participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. Any person that owns, directly or indirectly, five percent or more of our outstanding voting securities is our affiliate for purposes of the 1940 Act, and we are generally prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to such affiliate, absent the prior approval of our independent directors. GC Advisors and its affiliates are considered our affiliates for such purposes. The 1940 Act also prohibits certain joint transactions with certain of our affiliates, which could include investments in the same portfolio company, without prior approval of our independent directors and, in some cases, the SEC. We are prohibited from buying or selling any security from or to, among others, any person who owns more than 25% of our voting securities or certain of that persons affiliates, or entering into prohibited joint transactions with such persons, absent the prior approval of the SEC.\nWe can, however, invest alongside GC Advisors and its affiliates other clients in certain circumstances where doing so is consistent with applicable law, SEC staff, or Staff, interpretations and any co-investment exemptive relief order from the SEC. For example, we can invest alongside such accounts consistent with guidance promulgated by the Staff permitting us and such other accounts to purchase interests in a single class of privately placed securities so long as certain conditions are met, including that GC Advisors, acting on our behalf and on behalf of its other clients, negotiates no term other than price. We can also invest alongside GC Advisors other clients as otherwise permissible under regulatory guidance, applicable regulations and GC Advisors allocation policy. Under this allocation policy, GC Advisors will determine the amount of any proposed investment to be made by us and similar eligible accounts. We expect that these determinations will be made similarly for other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates. If sufficient securities or loan amounts are available to satisfy our and each such accounts proposed investment, the opportunity will be allocated in accordance with GC Advisors pre-transaction determination. Where there is an insufficient amount of an investment opportunity to fully satisfy us and other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates, the allocation policy further provides that allocations among us and other accounts will generally be made pro rata based on the relative capital available for investment of each of us and such other eligible accounts, subject to minimum and maximum investment size limits. In situations in which co-investment with other entities sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, GC Advisors will need to decide whether we or such other entity or entities will proceed with the investment. GC Advisors will make these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on a basis that will be fair and equitable over time, including, for example, through random or rotational methods. However, we can offer no assurance that investment opportunities will be allocated to us fairly or equitably in the short-term or over time.\nOn occasion, an investment opportunity will be too large to satisfy our desired position size and that of other investment funds and accounts managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates. GC Advisors can provide no assurance that it will be able to identify counterparties to participate in such investment opportunities, and could be required to decline to make investments where it does not believe that it can successfully sell some of the investment opportunity to another market participant.\nIn situations in which co-investment with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates is not permitted or appropriate, such as when, in the absence of the exemptive relief described below, we and such other accounts cannot make investments in the same issuer or where the different investments could be expected to result in a conflict between our interest and those of other accounts, GC Advisors needs to decide whether we or such other accounts will proceed with such investments. GC Advisors makes these determinations based on its policies and procedures, which generally require that such investment opportunities be offered to eligible accounts on a basis that is fair and equitable over time, including, for example, through random or rotational methods.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nMoreover, we generally will be unable to invest in an issuer in which an account sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates has previously invested. Similar restrictions limit our ability to transact business with our officers or directors or their affiliates. These restrictions limit the scope of investment opportunities that would otherwise be available to us.\nWe, GC Advisors and certain other funds and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates, have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investments if our board of directors determines that it would be advantageous for us to co-invest with other accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates in a manner consistent with our investment objectives, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors. Under the terms of this exemptive relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors is required to make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our investment strategies and policies. We believe that co-investment by us and accounts sponsored or managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates will afford us additional investment opportunities and the ability to achieve greater diversification. There could be many follow-on opportunities available to other entities advised by GC Advisors and its affiliates that are unavailable to us due to the limitations of the exemptive relief granted to GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nAlthough the terms of the exemptive relief require that GC Advisors will be given the opportunity to cause us to participate in certain transactions originated by affiliates of GC Advisors, GC Advisors could determine that we not participate in those transactions and for certain other transactions (as set forth in certain criteria approved by our board of directors) GC Advisors may not have the opportunity to cause us to participate. In addition, even if we and any such other entities sponsored or managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates invest in the same securities or loans, conflicts of interest could still arise. For example, it is possible that, as a result of legal, tax, regulatory, accounting, political or other considerations, the terms of such investment (and divestment thereof) (including with respect to price and timing) for us and such other entities advised by GC Advisors and its affiliates could differ. Additionally, we and such other entities advised by GC Advisors and its affiliates will generally have different investment periods and/or investment objectives (including return profiles) and, as a result, have conflicting goals with respect to the price and timing of disposition opportunities. As such, to the extent permissible under applicable law and any applicable order issued by the SEC, we and such other entities could dispose of co-investments at different times and on different terms.\nWe have entered into the Adviser Revolver resulting in a conflict of interest between GC Advisors obligation to act in its own best interest and in our best interest.\nWe have entered into the Adviser Revolver, an unsecured revolving loan agreement with GC Advisors. GC Advisors has a conflict of interest between its obligation to act in our best interest and its own best interest. Any such loans or advances made to us under the Adviser Revolver will be consistent with applicable law, GC Advisors fiduciary obligations to act in our best interests, our investment objectives, and the asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act. The terms associated with any such loans from GC Advisors or its affiliates, including the interest charged, shall, in the aggregate, be no more favorable to GC Advisors or its affiliates than could be obtained in an arms length transaction but will not necessarily be on the same terms or at the same interest rate charged by GC Advisors to other funds that it manages. Neither GC Advisors nor any of its affiliates is obligated to extend any such loans to us and such loans will not necessarily be made available to us in the same amounts or on the same economic terms as are made available to other funds advised by GC Advisors or its affiliates, or at all. In the event that we are required to find third-party financing in place of or in addition to loans from GC Advisors and its affiliates, such third-party financing could be at less favorable economic terms than the loans from GC Advisors and its affiliates, which could reduce our returns.\nGC Advisors could make certain investment decisions for the purpose of receiving transaction fees.\nIn connection with investments made by us, GC Advisors and its affiliates often receive origination, commitment, documentation, structuring, facility, monitoring, amendment, refinancing, administrative agent and/or other fees from portfolio investments in which we invest or propose to invest. The potential for GC Advisors and its affiliates to receive such economic benefits creates conflicts of interest as GC Advisors and its affiliates have an incentive to invest in portfolio investments that provide such benefits. Similarly, GC Advisors and its affiliates could be\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nincentivized to waive certain fees in connection with a refinancing in order to receive certain fees in the new transaction, including when we and/or other accounts advised by GC Advisors and its affiliates can participate in the original or refinanced investment, or both.\nReductions, waivers or absorptions of fees and costs can temporarily result in higher returns to investors than they would otherwise receive if full fees and costs were charged.\nGC Advisors and its affiliates are permitted to reduce, waive or absorb some of the fees or costs otherwise due by us. While this activity can be seen as friendly to investors, reductions, waivers and absorptions of fees and costs result in higher returns to investors than such investors would receive if full fees and costs were charged. There is no guarantee that any reductions, waivers or absorptions will occur in the future, and any reductions, waivers and absorptions are entirely at the discretion of GC Advisors or the Administrator, as applicable.\nGC Advisors could prioritize its relationship with a borrower or private equity sponsor instead of seeking the most advantageous terms for our investments.\nGC Advisors will not make any investment on behalf of us that it does not believe to be in our best interest. However, conflicts can arise in any particular transaction between obtaining the most advantageous terms for an investment, which benefits us and other clients of GC Advisors participating in that investment, and maintaining GC Advisors relationship with a borrower or private equity sponsor, which likely serves the long-term best interests of GC Advisors clients overall, including us. For example, affiliates of GC Advisors hold relatively small, minority investments in unaffiliated private equity funds, which arguably creates an incentive for GC Advisors to cause us to invest in portfolio companies owned by such private equity funds and to treat such portfolio companies more favorably in a workout situation. As another example of the conflicts that could arise, GC Advisors is permitted to reduce or waive transaction or prepayment fees, offer loan terms that are more favorable to the borrower (and conversely, less favorable to us), accept a below target position size, agree to amend certain terms or waive existing terms or defaults or make other similar concessions to maintain or improve a relationship with a private equity sponsor or borrower, which GC Advisors believes will increase the likelihood of repeat business that will benefit us and GC Advisors other clients.\nGC Advisors operates in multiple business lines and could pursue additional business lines, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of its time and focus.\nWhile Golub Capital maintains two major business lines, it has explored and will continue to explore opportunities outside these business lines. Such activity could adversely affect us. These risks include reputational damage, loss of management attention and time due to multiple constraints, regulatory sanctions, adverse impact to business relationships, increased competition of capital allocations, and expansion of potential risks to GC Advisors business as a whole outside those previously disclosed. New business lines could also exacerbate existing conflicts of interest and raise new conflicts.\nInvestors should be aware that other lines of business at Golub Capital could indirectly affect their investment in us, even if we are not directly exposed to those lines of business. While GC Advisors and its affiliates keep each investment client as a legally distinct entity or account, there are risks that a separate business line suffering a material adverse condition could affect other business lines to which we have direct exposure, and consequently, our performance. These risks could materially affect GC Advisors business as a whole, and include loss of reputation, loss of management time and focus, regulatory sanctions, and adverse impact to business relationships.\nGolub Capital could pursue strategic transactions, which could create a conflict of interest in the allocation of\nGC Advisors time and focus.\nGolub Capital could engage in any number of strategic transactions, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, new business formations, restructurings, launches of new investment fund strategies and structures or even a fund that pursues a strategy that is different than what Golub Capital has historically focused on, such as a private equity fund of funds. Additionally, Golub Capital could sell stakes in itself or in its affiliates or acquire stakes in other asset managers, service providers or investment vehicles, including to or from investors in the Company. In August 2018, Golub Capital sold a passive, non-voting minority stake in its management companies. While Golub Capital has not subsequently engaged in any material strategic transactions, it could do so in the future.\nStrategic transactions are subject to many risks, such as the risk that the transaction might not be successful in meeting its strategic goals, or the risk that the transaction might divert the attention of GC Advisors from our core\nTALE OF CONTENTS\ninvestment activities, or the risk that the management team will not be successful in developing and operating the underlying business involved in the strategic transaction.\nWe and GC Advisors could be the target of litigation or regulatory investigations.\nWe as well as GC Advisors and its affiliates participate in a highly regulated industry and are each subject to regulatory examinations in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that we and GC Advisors and/or any of its affiliates will avoid regulatory investigation and possible enforcement actions stemming therefrom. GC Advisors is a registered investment adviser and, as such, is subject to the provisions of the Investment Advisers Act. We and GC Advisors are each, from time to time, subject to formal and informal examinations, investigations, inquiries, audits and reviews from numerous regulatory authorities both in response to issues and questions raised in such examinations or investigations and in connection with the changing priorities of the applicable regulatory authorities across the market in general.\nThere is also a material risk that applicable governmental authorities and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions will continue to adopt new laws or regulations (such as tax, privacy and anti-money laundering laws or regulations), or change existing laws or regulations, or enhance the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, in each case in a manner that is burdensome for GC Advisors and for us. Any such events or changes could occur during the term of the Company and could adversely affect us or GC Advisors and GC Advisors ability to operate and/or pursue its management strategies on behalf of us. Further, any such events or changes could adversely affect obligors ability to make payments on loans to which we are directly or indirectly exposed or otherwise adversely affect the value of such investments. Such risks are often difficult or impossible to predict, avoid or mitigate in advance. As a result, there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing will not have an adverse impact on the business of GC Advisors and/or any of its affiliates or our performance. From time to time, GC Advisors and its affiliates could take certain actions that they determine are necessary, appropriate or in the best interests of us and our stockholders, taken as a whole, to mitigate the application or impact of certain laws or regulations.\nGC Advisors, its affiliates and/or any of their respective principals and employees could also be named as defendants in, or otherwise become involved in, litigation. Litigation and regulatory actions can be time-consuming and expensive and can lead to unexpected losses, which expenses and losses are often subject to indemnification by us. Legal proceedings could continue without resolution for long periods of time and their outcomes, which could materially and adversely affect the value of us or the ability of GC Advisors to manage us, are often impossible to anticipate. GC Advisors would likely be required to expend significant resources responding to any litigation or regulatory action related to it, and these actions could be a distraction to the activities of GC Advisors.\nOur investment activities are subject to the normal risks of becoming involved in litigation by third parties. This risk would be somewhat greater if we were to exercise control or significant influence over a portfolio companys direction. The expense of defending against claims by third parties and paying any amounts pursuant to settlements or judgments would, absent willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved by GC Advisors, the Administrator, or any of our officers, be borne by us and would reduce our net assets. GC Advisors and others are indemnified by us in connection with such litigation, subject to certain conditions.\nWe will be subject to corporate-level income tax if we are unable to qualify as a RIC.\nIn order to qualify as a RIC under the Code, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and distribution requirements. The distribution requirement for a RIC is satisfied if we distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, which is generally our net ordinary income plus the excess of our net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, to our stockholders each taxable year. We are subject, to the extent we use debt financing, to certain asset coverage ratio requirements under the 1940 Act and financial covenants under loan and credit agreements that could, under certain circumstances, restrict us from making distributions necessary to qualify as a RIC. If we are unable to obtain cash from other sources, we could fail to qualify as a RIC and, thus, could be subject to corporate-level income tax irrespective of the level of distributions paid to our stockholders. To qualify as a RIC, we must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of our taxable year. Failure to meet these requirements could result in our having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of our qualification as a RIC. Because most of our investments are in private or thinly traded public companies, any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices and could result in substantial losses. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nreason and become subject to corporate-level income tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distributions to stockholders and the amount of our distributions and the amount of funds available for new investments. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our securityholders. See Business - Taxation as a RIC.\nWe could need to raise additional capital to grow because we must distribute most of our income.\nWe could need additional capital to fund new investments and grow our portfolio of investments. We intend to access the capital markets periodically to issue debt or equity securities or borrow from financial institutions in order to obtain such additional capital. Unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. A reduction in the availability of new capital could limit our ability to grow. In addition, in order to qualify as a RIC, we are required to distribute each taxable year an amount generally at least equal to 90% of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes, to our stockholders. As a result, these earnings are not available to fund new investments. An inability to access the capital markets successfully could limit our ability to grow our business and execute our business strategy fully and could decrease our earnings, if any, which could have an adverse effect on the value of our securities. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we could receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.\nWe could have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before, or without, receiving cash representing such income.\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash, such as the accretion of original issue discount. This could arise if we receive warrants in connection with the making of a loan and in other circumstances, or through contracted PIK interest, which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term. Such original issue discount, which could be significant relative to our overall investment activities, or increases in loan balances as a result of contractual PIK arrangements, is included in income before we receive any corresponding cash payments. We also could be required to include in income certain other amounts that we do not receive in cash.\nThat part of the incentive fee payable by us that relates to our net investment income is computed and paid on income that includes interest that has been accrued but not yet received in cash, such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities. It is possible that accrued interest or other income previously used in the calculation of the incentive fee will become uncollectible, and GC Advisors has no obligation to refund any fees it received in respect of such accrued income.\nSince in certain cases we could recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income, we could have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, to our stockholders in order to maintain our qualification as a RIC. In such a case, we could have to sell some of our investments at times we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital or reduce new investment originations to meet these distribution requirements. If we are not able to obtain such cash from other sources, we could fail to qualify as a RIC and thus be subject to corporate-level income tax. See Business - Taxation as a RIC.\nThe tax treatment of a non-U.S. stockholder in its jurisdiction of tax residence will depend entirely on the laws of such jurisdiction and could vary considerably from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\nDepending on (1) the laws of such non-U.S. stockholders jurisdiction of tax residence, (2) how we are treated in such jurisdiction, and (3) our activities, an investment in us could result in such non-U.S. stockholder recognizing adverse tax consequences in its jurisdiction of tax residence, including with respect to any generally required or additional tax filings and/or additional disclosure required in such filings in relation to the treatment for tax purposes in the relevant jurisdiction of an interest in us and/or of distributions from us and any uncertainties arising in that respect (the Company not being established under the laws of the relevant jurisdiction), the possibility of taxable income significantly in excess of cash distributed to a non-U.S. stockholder, and possibly in excess of our actual economic income, the possibilities of losing deductions or the ability to utilize tax basis and of sums invested being returned in the form of taxable income or gains, and the possibility of being subject to tax at unfavorable tax rates. A\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nnon-U.S. stockholder could also be subject to restrictions on the use of its share of our deductions and losses in its jurisdiction of tax residence. Each stockholder is urged to consult its own tax advisers with respect to the tax and tax filing consequences, if any, in its jurisdiction of tax residence of an investment in us, as well as any other jurisdiction in which such prospective investor is subject to taxation.\nRegulations governing our operation as a business development company affect our ability to, and the way in which we, raise additional capital. As a business development company, the necessity of raising additional capital exposes us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.\nWe could issue debt securities or preferred stock and/or borrow money from banks or other financial institutions, which we refer to collectively as senior securities, up to the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Under the current provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted as a business development company to issue senior securities in amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals the percentage of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities after each issuance of senior securities that is applicable to us under Section 61 of the 1940 Act. Following the approval of our stockholders of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and subject to our compliance with certain disclosure requirements, effective as of February 6, 2019, under the provisions of the 1940 Act, we are permitted as a business development company to issue senior securities in amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% of gross assets less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, after each issuance of senior securities. Under the reduced 150% asset coverage requirement, we are permitted under the 1940 Act to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement that would otherwise apply to a business development company. If the value of our assets declines, we could be unable to satisfy this ratio. If that happens, we could be required to sell a portion of our investments and, depending on the nature of our leverage, repay a portion of our indebtedness at a time when such activities could be disadvantageous. This could have a material adverse effect on our operations, and we may not be able to make distributions in an amount sufficient to be subject to tax as a RIC, or at all. Also, any amounts that we use to service our indebtedness would not be available for distributions to our common stockholders. If we issue senior securities, we will be exposed to typical risks associated with leverage, including an increased risk of loss. As of September 30, 2022, we had $3.1 billion of outstanding borrowings, including $408.2 million and $546.0 million outstanding under the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, respectively.\nIn the absence of an event of default, no person or entity from which we borrow money has a veto right or voting power over our ability to set policy, make investment decisions or adopt investment strategies. If we issue preferred stock, which is another form of leverage, the preferred stock would rank senior to common stock in our capital structure, preferred stockholders would have separate voting rights on certain matters and could have other rights, preferences or privileges more favorable than those of our common stockholders, and the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change of control that could involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our common stockholders. Holders of our common stock will directly or indirectly bear all of the costs associated with offering and servicing any preferred stock that we issue. In addition, any interests of preferred stockholders would not necessarily align with the interests of holders of our common stock and the rights of holders of shares of preferred stock to receive distributions would be senior to those of holders of shares of our common stock. We do not, however, anticipate issuing preferred stock in the next 12 months.\nWe are not generally able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. We could, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value per share of our common stock if our board of directors determines that such sale is in the best interests of us and our stockholders, and, in certain cases, if our stockholders approve such sale. In any such case, the price at which our securities are to be issued and sold cannot be less than a price that, in the determination of our board of directors, closely approximates the market value of such securities (less any distributing commission or discount). If we raise additional funds by issuing common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, our common stock, then the percentage ownership of our stockholders at that time would decrease, and holders of our common stock could experience dilution.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWe finance our investments with borrowed money, which will accelerate and increase the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and could increase the risk of investing in us.\nThe use of leverage accelerates and increases the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested. The use of leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique and increases the risks associated with investing in our securities. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on GC Advisors and our board of directors assessment of market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. While we intend to target a leverage ratio of 0.85x to 1.25x debt-to-equity, this limitation will not prevent us from incurring additional leverage or otherwise exceeding such leverage ratio to the full extent permissible under the 1940 Act, including during periods when we are experiencing unusual market volatility or other unexpected conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain credit at all or on terms acceptable to us. While leverage presents opportunities for increasing our total return, it also has the potential to increase losses. Accordingly, any event that adversely affects the value of an investment would be magnified to the extent we use leverage. Such events could result in a substantial loss to us, which would be greater than if leverage had not been used. In addition, our investment objectives are dependent on the continued availability of leverage at attractive relative interest rates.\nWe could issue senior debt securities to banks, insurance companies and other lenders. Lenders of these senior securities will have fixed dollar claims on our assets that are superior to the claims of our common stockholders, and we would expect such lenders to seek recovery against our assets in the event of a default. We have the ability to pledge up to 100% of our assets and can grant a security interest in all of our assets under the terms of any debt instruments we could enter into with lenders. The terms of our existing indebtedness require us to comply with certain financial and operational covenants, and we expect similar covenants in future debt instruments. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default under the applicable credit facility or debt instrument if we are unable to obtain a waiver from the applicable lender or holder, and such lender or holder could accelerate repayment under such indebtedness and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, under the terms of any credit facility or other debt instrument we enter into, we are likely to be required by its terms to use the net proceeds of any investments that we sell to repay a portion of the amount borrowed under such facility or instrument before applying such net proceeds to any other uses. If the value of our assets decreases, leveraging would cause our net asset value to decline more sharply than it otherwise would have had we not used leverage, thereby magnifying losses or eliminating our equity stake in a leveraged investment. Similarly, any decrease in our net investment income will cause our net income to decline more sharply than it would have had we not borrowed. Such a decline would also negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock. Our ability to service our debt depends largely on our financial performance and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures. Our common stockholders bear the burden of any increase in our expenses as a result of our use of leverage, including interest expenses and any increase in the base management fee payable to GC Advisors.\nFollowing the approval of our stockholders of the reduced asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act and subject to our compliance with certain disclosure requirements, effective as of February 6, 2019, the reduced asset coverage requirement permits us to double the maximum amount of leverage that we are permitted to incur, which provides us with increased investment flexibility, but also increases our risks related to leverage.\nThe following table illustrates the effect of leverage on returns from an investment in our common stock as of September 30, 2022, assuming various annual returns, net of expenses. The calculations in the table below are hypothetical and actual returns could be higher or lower than those appearing in the table below.\nAssumed Return on Our Portfolio (Net of Expenses)\n-10% -5% 0% 5% 10%\nCorresponding return to common stockholder(1)\n-26.03% -14.87% -3.70% 7.46% 18.63%\n(1)Assumes $5.7 billion in total assets, $3.1 billion in debt and secured borrowings outstanding and $2.5 billion in net assets as of September 30, 2022 and an effective annual interest rate of 3.04% as of September 30, 2022.\nBased on our outstanding indebtedness of $3.1 billion as of September 30, 2022 and the effective annual interest rate, which includes amortization of debt financing costs, amortization of discounts on notes issued and non-usage facility fees, of 3.04% as of that date, our investment portfolio would have been required to experience an annual return of at least 3.02% to cover annual interest payments on the outstanding debt.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nIf we are unable to obtain leverage or if the interest rates of such leverage are not attractive, we could experience diminished returns. The number of leverage providers and the total amount of financing available could decrease or remain static. We could, directly or through subsidiaries, have concentrated exposure to a small number of commercial lenders or other financing providers, which could result in us being dependent on the continued availability of capital from such financing providers. Consequently, available financing could be more expensive or on terms that are less desirable than in an environment with a larger number of leverage providers.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the Debt Securitizations.\nAs a result of the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, we are subject to a variety of risks, including those set forth below. We use the term debt securitization in this annual report on Form 10-K to describe a form of secured borrowing under which an operating company (sometimes referred to as an originator or sponsor) acquires or originates mortgages, receivables, loans or other assets that earn income, whether on a one-time or recurring basis (collectively, income producing assets), and borrows money on a non-recourse basis against a legally separate pool of loans or other income producing assets. In a typical debt securitization, the originator transfers the loans or income producing assets to a single-purpose, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary (also referred to as a special purpose entity), which is established solely for the purpose of holding loans and income producing assets and issuing debt secured by these income producing assets. The special purpose entity completes the borrowing through the issuance of notes secured by the loans or other assets. The special purpose entity could issue the notes in the capital markets to a variety of investors, including banks, non-bank financial institutions and other investors. The special purpose entities that issued the notes in the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization were the 2018 Issuer and the GCIC 2018 Issuer, respectively (each such special purpose entity, a Securitization Issuer). The 2018 Issuer and the GCIC 2018 Issuer are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 2018 CLO Depositor and GCIC CLO Depositor, respectively, each a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (each, a CLO Depositor). In each of the Debt Securitizations, institutional investors purchased certain notes issued by the applicable Securitization Issuer in private placements.\nWe are subject to certain risks as a result of our direct or indirect interests in the junior notes and membership interests of each Securitization Issuer.\nUnder the terms of the respective loan sale agreement or loan sale agreements governing each Debt Securitization, we sold and/or contributed to the applicable Securitization Issuer all of our ownership interest in our portfolio loans and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in such loan sale agreement. Following this transfer, the applicable Securitization Issuer held all of the ownership interest in such portfolio loans and participations.\nUnder the terms of the respective loan sale agreements entered into upon closing of each of the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization (each a Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement), which provided for the sale of assets on the applicable closing date to satisfy risk retention requirements, (1) we transferred to GC Advisors a portion of our ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing such Debt Securitization for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the applicable Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement and (2) immediately thereafter, GC Advisors sold to the respective Securitization Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the applicable Closing Date Loan Sale Agreement. Under the terms of the other loan sale agreement governing each such Debt Securitization (each, a Depositor Loan Sale Agreement), which provides for the sale of assets on the applicable closing date as well as future sales from us to the applicable Securitization Issuer through the applicable CLO Depositor, (1) we sold and/or contributed to the applicable CLO Depositor the remainder of our ownership interest in the portfolio company investments securing the applicable Debt Securitization and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in the applicable Depositor Loan Sale Agreement and (2) the applicable CLO Depositor, in turn, sold to the applicable Securitization Issuer all of its ownership interest in such portfolio loans and participations for the purchase price and other consideration set forth in one of the loan sale agreements. Following these transfers, the applicable Securitization Issuer, and not GC Advisors, the applicable CLO Depositor or us, held all of the ownership interest in such portfolio company investments and participations.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we held indirectly through the applicable CLO Depositor, the Class C-2 2018 Notes, the Class D 2018 Notes, the Subordinated 2018 Notes, and 100% of the membership interests in the 2018 Issuer, the Class C GCIC 2018 Notes, the Class D GCIC 2018 Notes, the Subordinated GCIC 2018 Notes and 100% of the membership interests in the GCIC 2018 Issuer. As a result, we consolidate the financial statements of the 2018 Issuer and the GCIC 2018 Issuer, as well as our other subsidiaries, in our consolidated financial statements.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nBecause each of the Securitization Issuers and CLO Depositors is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the sale or contribution by us or a CLO Depositor to a Securitization Issuer or by us to a CLO Depositor did not constitute a taxable event for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the U.S. Internal Revenue Service were to take a contrary position, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We could, from time to time, hold asset-backed securities, or the economic equivalent thereof, issued by a securitization vehicle sponsored by another business development company to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act.\nThe notes and membership interests that we hold that are issued by the Securitization Issuers are subordinated obligations of the applicable Securitization Issuer and we could be prevented from receiving cash from such Securitization Issuer.\nThe notes issued by the Securitization Issuers and retained by us are the most junior class of notes issued by the applicable Securitization Issuer, are subordinated in priority of payment to the other notes issued by such Securitization Issuer and are subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in the indenture governing the notes issued by such Securitization Issuer. Therefore, we only receive cash distributions on such Notes if the applicable Securitization Issuer has made all cash interest payments to all other notes it has issued. Consequently, to the extent that the value of the portfolio of loan investments held by a Securitization Issuer has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, or as a result of defaulted loans or individual fund assets, the value of any notes that we have retained at their redemption could be reduced. If a Securitization Issuer does not meet the asset coverage tests or the interest coverage test set forth in the documents governing the applicable Debt Securitization, cash would be diverted from the notes that we hold to first pay the more senior notes issued by such Securitization Issuer in amounts sufficient to cause such tests to be satisfied.\nEach Securitization Issuer is the residual claimant on funds, if any, remaining after holders of all classes of notes issued by such Securitization Issuer have been paid in full on each payment date or upon maturity of such notes under the applicable Debt Securitization documents. As the holder of the membership interests in each Securitization Issuer, we could receive distributions, if any, only to the extent that the applicable Securitization Issuer makes distributions out of funds remaining after holders of all classes of notes issued by such Securitization Issuer have been paid in full on each payment date any amounts due and owing on such payment date or upon maturity of such notes. In the event that we fail to receive cash directly from a Securitization Issuer, we could be unable to make distributions in amounts sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, or at all.\nThe interests of holders of the senior classes of securities issued by the Securitization Issuers could not be aligned with our interests.\nThe notes issued by each Securitization Issuer that are held by third parties (the Senior Securitization Notes) are debt obligations ranking senior in right of payment to other securities issued by the respective Securitization Issuer in the applicable Debt Securitization. As such, there are circumstances in which the interests of holders of the Senior Securitization Notes may not be aligned with the interests of holders of the other classes of notes issued by, and membership interests of, the applicable Securitization Issuer. For example, under the terms of the Class A 2018 Notes, holders of the Class A 2018 Notes have the right to receive payments of principal and interest prior to holders of the Class B 2018 Notes, the Class C-1 2018 Notes and the 2018 Issuer.\nAs used herein, Controlling Class refers to the most senior class of notes then outstanding with respect to a Securitization Issuer. If the most senior class of outstanding notes are paid in full, then the next most senior class of notes would comprise the Controlling Class under the documents governing the applicable Debt Securitization. For example, as long as the Class A 2018 Notes and the Class A GCIC 2018 Notes are outstanding, holders of such class of notes comprise the Controlling Class under the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, respectively. If such notes or loans are paid in full, then the Class B 2018 Notes and the Class B GCIC 2018 Notes would comprise the Controlling Class under the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, respectively. Holders of the Controlling Class under the applicable Debt Securitization have the right to act in certain circumstances with respect to the portfolio loans in ways that could benefit their interests but not the interests of holders of more junior classes of notes and membership interests, including by exercising remedies under the indenture in the applicable Debt Securitization.\nIf an event of default has occurred and acceleration occurs in accordance with the terms of the indenture for a Debt Securitization, the Controlling Class of such Debt Securitization, as the most senior class of notes or loans then outstanding in such Debt Securitization will be paid in full before any further payment or distribution on the more\nTALE OF CONTENTS\njunior classes of notes and membership interests. In addition, if an event of default under a Debt Securitization, holders of a majority of the Controlling Class of the applicable Debt Securitization could be entitled to determine the remedies to be exercised under the applicable indenture, subject to the terms of such indenture. For example, upon the occurrence of an event of default with respect to the notes issued by the 2018 Issuer, the trustee or holders of a majority of the Controlling Class could declare the principal, together with any accrued interest, of all the notes of such class and any junior classes to be immediately due and payable. This would have the effect of accelerating the principal on such notes, triggering a repayment obligation on the part of the 2018 Issuer. If at such time the portfolio loans were not performing well, the Securitization Issuer could not have sufficient proceeds available to enable the trustee under the indenture to repay the obligations of holders of the notes we hold, or to pay a dividend to holders of the membership interests.\nRemedies pursued by the Controlling Class could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the notes that are subordinated to the Controlling Class (which would include, for example, the Class C-2 2018 Notes, Class D 2018 Notes and Subordinated 2018 Notes to the extent the Class A 2018 Notes, Class B 2018 Notes, Class C-1 2018 Notes and Class C-2 2018 Notes, or Class D 2018 Notes constitute the Controlling Class, the Class B-2 GCIC 2018 Notes, Class C GCIC 2018 Notes, Class D GCIC 2018 Notes and Subordinated GCIC 2018 Notes to the extent the Class A-1 GCIC 2018 Notes, Class A-2 GCIC 2018 Notes, Class B GCIC 2018 Notes, Class C GCIC 2018 Notes or Class D GCIC 2018 Notes constitute the Controlling Class) and the Controlling Class will have no obligation to consider any possible adverse effect on such other interests. Thus, we cannot assure you that any remedies pursued by the Controlling Class will be in the best interests of the applicable CLO Depositor or us or that the applicable CLO Depositor or we will receive any payments or distributions upon an acceleration of the notes. In a liquidation under any of the Debt Securitizations, the notes that we have directly or indirectly retained will be subordinated to payment of the other classes notes issued by the applicable Securitization Issuer and could not be paid in full to the extent funds remaining after payment of more senior notes not held by us are insufficient. In addition, after certain senior classes of notes are paid in full, the remaining noteholder could amend the applicable indenture to, among other things, direct the assignment of any remaining assets to other wholly-owned subsidiaries for a price less than the fair market value of such assets with the difference in price to be considered an equity contribution to such subsidiaries. Any failure of a Securitization Issuer to make distributions on the notes we indirectly or directly hold, whether as a result of an event of default, liquidation or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could result in an inability of us to make distributions sufficient to maintain our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC, or at all.\nA Securitization Issuer could fail to meet certain asset coverage tests.\nUnder the documents governing each of the Debt Securitizations, there are two asset coverage tests applicable to the Class A 2018 Notes, the Class B 2018 Notes, the Class C-1 2018 Notes, the Class C-2 2018 Notes and the Class D 2018 Notes, with respect to the 2018 Issuer; and the Class A GCIC 2018 Notes, Class B GCIC 2018 Notes, Class C GCIC 2018 Notes and Class D GCIC 2018, with respect to the GCIC 2018 Issuer.\nThe first such test compares the amount of interest received on the portfolio loans held by the applicable Securitization Issuer to the amount of interest payable in respect of the applicable class of notes. To meet this first test, in the case of the 2018 Debt Securitization, interest received on the portfolio loans must equal at least 120% of the interest payable in respect of the Class A 2018 Notes and Class B 2018 Notes, taken together, at least 110% of the interest payable in respect of the Class C-1 2018 Notes and the Class C-2 2018 Notes, taken together, and at least 105% of the interest payable in respect of the Class D 2018 Notes; and, in the case of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, interest received on the portfolio loans must equal at least 120% of the interest payable in respect of the Class A GCIC 2018 Notes and Class B GCIC 2018 Notes, taken together, and at least 110% of the interest payable in respect of the Class C GCIC 2018 Notes and at least 105% of the interest payable in respect of the Class D GCIC 2018 Notes.\nThe second such test compares the principal amount of the portfolio loans of the applicable Debt Securitization to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the applicable class of notes. To meet this second test at any time in the case of the 2018 Debt Securitization, the aggregate principal amount of the portfolio loans must equal at least 145.6% of the Class A 2018 Notes and Class B 2018 Notes, taken together, at least 126.7% of the Class C-1 2018 Notes and Class C-2 2018 Notes, taken together, and at least 116.7% of the Class D 2018 Notes. To meet this second test at any time in the case of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, the aggregate principal amount of the portfolio loans must equal at least 147.9% of the Class A GCIC 2018 Notes and Class B GCIC 2018 Notes, taken together, at least 127.1% of the Class C GCIC 2018 Notes and at least 117.5% of the Class D GCIC 2018 Notes.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nIf any asset coverage test with respect to a class of notes is not met, proceeds from the portfolio of loan investments that otherwise would have been distributed to the holders of the notes and membership interests that we hold will instead be used to redeem first the most senior class of notes in such Debt Securitization and then each next most senior class of notes, to the extent necessary to satisfy the applicable asset coverage tests on a pro forma basis after giving effect to all payments made in respect of the notes, which we refer to as a mandatory redemption, or to obtain the necessary ratings confirmation.\nThe value of the Class C-2 2018 Notes, Class D 2018 Notes, Subordinated 2018 Notes, Class B-2 GCIC 2018 Notes, Class C GCIC 2018 Notes, Class D GCIC 2018 Notes or the Subordinated GCIC 2018 Notes could be adversely affected by a mandatory redemption because such redemption could result in the applicable notes being redeemed at par at a time when they are trading in the secondary market at a premium to their stated principal amount and when other investments bearing the same rate of interest could be difficult or expensive to acquire. A mandatory redemption could also result in a shorter investment duration than a holder of such notes could have wanted or anticipated, which could, in turn, result in such a holder incurring breakage costs on related hedging transactions. In addition, the reinvestment period under the 2018 Debt Securitization and the 2018 GCIC Debt Securitization could extend through as late as January 15, 2023 and January 20, 2023, respectively. During the respective reinvestment period, market conditions and restrictions on investment under the indenture governing the applicable Debt Securitization could result in periods of time in which the applicable Securitization Issuer is not able to fully invest its available collateral or during which collateral available is not of comparable quality or yield, which could affect the value of the collateral securing the notes issued by such Securitization Issuer that we hold.\nWe could be required to assume liabilities of a Securitization Issuer and are indirectly liable for certain representations and warranties in connection with each Debt Securitization.\nThe structure of each Debt Securitization is intended to prevent, in the event of our bankruptcy or the bankruptcy of a CLO Depositor, if applicable, the consolidation of the applicable Securitization Issuer with our operations or with the applicable CLO Depositor. If the true sale of the assets in each Debt Securitization were not respected in the event of our insolvency, a trustee or debtor-in-possession might reclaim the assets of the applicable Securitization Issuer for our estate. However, in doing so, we would become directly liable for all of the indebtedness then outstanding under the applicable Debt Securitization, which would equal the full amount of debt of the applicable Securitization Issuer reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. In addition, we cannot assure you that the recovery in the event we were consolidated with a Securitization Issuer for purposes of any bankruptcy proceeding would exceed the amount to which we would otherwise be entitled as the holder of the notes issued by such Securitization Issuer and retained by us had we not been consolidated with the applicable Securitization Issuer.\nIn addition, in connection with each of the Debt Securitizations, we indirectly gave the lenders certain customary representations with respect to the legal structure of the respective Securitization Issuer, and the quality of the assets transferred to each entity. We remain indirectly liable for any breach of such representations for the life of the applicable Debt Securitization.\nCertain Securitization Issuers could issue additional Notes.\nUnder the terms of the documents governing the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, the applicable Securitization Issuer could issue additional notes and use the net proceeds of such issuance to purchase additional portfolio loans. Any such additional issuance, however, would require the consent of the collateral manager to the applicable Debt Securitization and, in the case of each of the 2018 Debt Securitization and the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization, the applicable CLO Depositor and a supermajority of the Subordinated 2018 Notes or Subordinated GCIC 2018 Notes, as applicable. Among the other conditions that must be satisfied in connection with an additional issuance of notes, the aggregate principal amount of all additional issuances of notes may not exceed 100% of the respective original outstanding principal amount of such class of notes; the applicable Securitization Issuer must notify each rating agency of such issuance prior to the issuance date; and the terms of the notes to be issued must be identical to the terms of previously issued notes of the same class (except that all monies due on such additional notes will accrue from the issue date of such notes and that the spread over LIBOR and prices of such notes do not have to be identical to those of the initial notes, provided that the interest rate on such additional notes must not exceed the interest rate applicable to the initial class of such notes). We do not expect to cause the 2018 Issuer or the GCIC 2018 Issuer to issue any additional notes at this time. We could amend the documents governing each Debt Securitization from time to time, and without amendment, the 2018 Debt Securitization documents do not provide for additional issuances of Class A 2018 Notes. The total purchase price for any\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nadditional notes that could be issued may not always equal 100% of the par value of such notes, depending on several factors, including fees and closing expenses.\nWe are subject to risks associated with any Revolving Credit Facility that utilizes a Funding Subsidiary as our interests in any Funding Subsidiary are subordinated and we could be prevented from receiving cash on our equity interests from a Funding Subsidiary.\nWe own directly or indirectly 100% of the equity interests in each of our Funding Subsidiaries. We consolidate the financial statements of our Funding Subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements and treat the indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facilities as our leverage. Our interests in our Funding Subsidiaries are subordinated in priority of payment to every other obligation of such Funding Subsidiary and are subject to certain payment restrictions set forth in each Revolving Credit Facility.\nWe receive cash from a Funding Subsidiary only to the extent that we receive distributions on our equity interests in such Funding Subsidiary. Each Funding Subsidiary could make distributions on its equity interests only to the extent permitted by the payment priority provisions of the applicable Revolving Credit Facility. Each of the Revolving Credit Facilities generally provides that payments on the respective interests could not be made on any payment date unless all amounts owing to the lenders and other secured parties are paid in full. In addition, if a Funding Subsidiary does not meet the asset coverage tests or the interest coverage test set forth in the documents of the applicable Revolving Credit Facility, a default would occur. In the event of a default under a Revolving Credit Facility document, cash would be diverted from us to pay the applicable lender and other secured parties in amounts sufficient to cause such tests to be satisfied. In the event that we fail to receive cash from our Funding Subsidiaries, we could be unable to make distributions to our stockholders in amounts sufficient to maintain our status as a RIC, or at all. We also could be forced to sell investments in portfolio companies at less than their fair value in order to continue making such distributions. We cannot assure you that distributions on the assets held by our Funding Subsidiaries will be sufficient to make any distributions to us or that such distributions will meet our expectations.\nOur equity interests in each Funding Subsidiary rank behind all of the secured and unsecured creditors, known or unknown, of such Funding Subsidiary, including the lenders in the respective Revolving Credit Facility. Consequently, to the extent that the value of a Funding Subsidiarys portfolio of loan investments has been reduced as a result of conditions in the credit markets, defaulted loans, capital gains and losses on the underlying assets, prepayment or changes in interest rates, the returns on our investments in such Funding Subsidiary could be reduced. Accordingly, our investments in each of our Funding Subsidiaries could be subject to up to 100% loss.\nThe ability to sell investments held by our Funding Subsidiaries is limited.\nEach of the Revolving Credit Facilities place significant restrictions on our ability, as servicer, to sell investments. As a result, there could be times or circumstances during which we are unable to sell investments or take other actions that might be in our best interests.\nWe can enter into repurchase agreements, which are another form of leverage.\nWe can enter, and have in the past entered, into repurchase agreements as part of our management of our investment portfolio. Under a repurchase agreement, we will effectively pledge our assets as collateral to secure a short-term loan where the counterparty acquires securities we hold as collateral subject to our obligation to repurchase and its obligation to resell the securities at an agreed upon time and price. Generally, the other party to the agreement makes the loan in an amount equal to a percentage of the fair value of the pledged collateral. At the maturity of the repurchase agreement, we will be required to repay the loan and correspondingly receive back our collateral. While used as collateral, the assets continue to pay principal and interest which are for our benefit.\nOur use of repurchase agreements, if any, involves many of the same risks involved in our use of leverage, as the proceeds from repurchase agreements generally will be invested in additional securities. There is a risk that the market value of the securities acquired in the repurchase agreement could decline below the price of the securities that we have sold but remain obligated to purchase. In addition, there is a risk that the market value of the securities retained by us could decline. If a buyer of securities under a repurchase agreement were to file for bankruptcy or experience insolvency, we could be adversely affected. Also, in entering into repurchase agreements, we would bear the risk of loss to the extent that the proceeds of such agreements at settlement are less than the fair value of the underlying securities being pledged. In addition, due to the interest costs associated with repurchase agreements, our net asset value would decline, and, in some cases, we could be worse off than if we had not used such agreements.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nAdverse developments in the credit markets can impair our ability to enter into new debt financing arrangements.\nDuring the economic downturn in the United States that began in mid-2007, many commercial banks and other\nfinancial institutions stopped lending or significantly curtailed their lending activity. In addition, in an effort to stem\nlosses and reduce their exposure to segments of the economy deemed to be high risk, some financial institutions\nlimited routine refinancing and loan modification transactions and even reviewed the terms of existing facilities to\nidentify bases for accelerating the maturity of existing lending facilities. To the extent these circumstances arise\nagain in the future, it could be difficult for us to finance the growth of our investments on acceptable economic terms, or at all and one or more of our leverage facilities could be accelerated by the lenders.\nOur ability to invest in public companies is limited in certain circumstances. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could fail to qualify as a business development company or be precluded from investing according to our current business strategy and decrease our operating flexibility.\nTo maintain our status as a business development company, we are not permitted to acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Subject to certain exceptions for follow-on investments and investments in distressed companies, an investment in an issuer that has outstanding securities listed on a national securities exchange could be treated as qualifying assets only if such issuer has a common equity market capitalization that is less than $250.0 million at the time of such investment.\nSee Business - Regulation - Qualifying Assets.\nWe could be precluded from investing in what we believe are attractive investments if such investments are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 1940 Act. If we do not invest a sufficient portion of our assets in qualifying assets, we could violate the 1940 Act provisions applicable to business development companies. As a result of such violation, specific rules under the 1940 Act could prevent us, for example, from making follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies (which could result in the dilution of our position) or could require us to dispose of investments at inappropriate times in order to come into compliance with the 1940 Act. If we need to dispose of such investments quickly, it could be difficult to dispose of such investments on favorable terms. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to find a buyer for such investments and, even if we do find a buyer, we could be forced to sell the investments at a substantial loss. Any such outcomes would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we do not maintain our status as a business development company, we would be subject to regulation as a registered closed-end investment company under the 1940 Act. As a registered closed-end investment company, we would be subject to substantially more regulatory restrictions under the 1940 Act, which would significantly decrease our operating flexibility.\nThe majority of our portfolio investments are recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors and, as a result, there could be uncertainty as to the value of our portfolio investments.\nUnder the 1940 Act, we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value as determined pursuant to policies adopted by, and subject to the oversight of, our board of directors. The majority of our portfolio investments take the form of securities that are not publicly traded. The fair value of securities and other investments that are not publicly traded is often not readily determinable, and we value these securities at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, including to reflect significant events affecting the value of our securities. As discussed in more detail under Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies, most, if not all, of our investments (other than cash and cash equivalents) are classified as Level 3 under Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure, as amended, or ASC Topic 820. This means that our portfolio valuations are based on unobservable inputs and our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. Inputs into the determination of fair value of our portfolio investments require significant management judgment or estimation, the level of which could increase or decrease during periods of volatility or uncertainty. See -Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure - We are currently in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty. Even if observable market data are available, such information could be the result of consensus pricing information or broker quotes, which could include a disclaimer that the broker would not be held to such a price in an actual transaction. The non-binding nature of consensus pricing and/or quotes accompanied by disclaimers materially reduces the reliability of such information.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWe have retained the services of several independent service providers to review the valuation of these securities. At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment for which a market quote is not readily available is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The types of factors that our board of directors could take into account in determining the fair value of our investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities, including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. Because such valuations, and particularly valuations of private securities and private companies, are inherently uncertain, could fluctuate over short periods of time and could be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value could differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Our net asset value could be adversely affected if our determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher than the values that we ultimately realize upon the disposal of such securities.\nWe adjust quarterly the valuation of our portfolio to reflect our board of directors determination of the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. Any changes in fair value are recorded in our consolidated statement of operations as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation.\nGovernment intervention in the credit markets could adversely affect our business.\nThe central banks and, in particular, the U.S. Federal Reserve, have taken unprecedented steps since the financial crises of 2008-2009 and the COVID-19 global pandemic and in response to inflationary pressures. It is impossible to predict if, how, and to what extent the United States and other governments would further intervene in the credit markets. Such intervention is often prompted by politically sensitive issues involving family homes, student loans, real estate speculation, credit card receivables, pandemics, etc., and could, as a result, be contrary to what we would predict from an economically rational perspective.\nOn the other hand, recent governmental intervention could mean that the willingness of governmental bodies to take additional extraordinary action is diminished. As a result, in the event of near-term major market disruptions, like those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be only limited additional government intervention, resulting in correspondingly greater market dislocation and materially greater market risk.\nOur board of directors could change our investment objective, operating policies and strategies without prior notice or stockholder approval.\nOur board of directors has the authority, except as otherwise provided in the 1940 Act, to modify or waive our investment objective and certain of our operating policies and strategies without prior notice and without stockholder approval. However, absent stockholder approval, we cannot change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a business development company. Under Delaware law, we also cannot be dissolved without prior stockholder approval. We cannot predict the effect any changes to our current investment objective, operating policies and strategies would have on our business, operating results and the price of our common stock. Nevertheless, any such changes could adversely affect our business and impair our ability to make distributions.\nProvisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could deter takeover attempts, which could have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nThe General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, contains provisions that are intended to discourage, delay or make more difficult a change in control of us or the removal of our directors. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that limit liability and provide for indemnification of our directors and officers. These provisions and others also could have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management. We are subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, the application of which is subject to any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. This section generally prohibits us from engaging in mergers and other business combinations with stockholders that beneficially own 15% or more of our voting stock, or with their affiliates, unless our directors or stockholders approve the business combination in the prescribed manner. If our board of directors does not approve a business combination, Section 203 of the DGCL could discourage third parties from trying to acquire control of us and increase the difficulty of consummating such an offer.\nWe have also adopted measures that could make it difficult for a third party to obtain control of us, including provisions of our certificate of incorporation classifying our board of directors in three classes serving staggered three-year terms, and provisions of our certificate of incorporation authorizing our board of directors to classify or reclassify shares of our preferred stock in one or more classes or series, to cause the issuance of additional shares of\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nour stock, and to amend our certificate of incorporation, without stockholder approval, in certain instances. These provisions, as well as other provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might otherwise be in the best interests of our securityholders.\nGC Advisors can resign on 60 days notice, and we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement within that time, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nGC Advisors has the right to resign under the Investment Advisory Agreement at any time upon not less than 60 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If GC Advisors resigns, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a new investment adviser or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms within 60 days, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and investment activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a single institution or group of executives having the expertise possessed by GC Advisors and its affiliates. Even if we are able to retain comparable management, whether internal or external, the integration of such management and their lack of familiarity with our investment objective and portfolio could result in additional costs and time delays that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Administrator can resign on 60 days notice, and we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a suitable replacement, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations.\nThe Administrator has the right to resign under the Administration Agreement at any time upon not less than 60 days written notice, whether we have found a replacement or not. If the Administrator resigns, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to find a new administrator or hire internal management with similar expertise and ability to provide the same or equivalent services on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so quickly, our operations are likely to experience a disruption, our financial condition, business and results of operations as well as our ability to pay distributions are likely to be adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, the coordination of our internal management and administrative activities is likely to suffer if we are unable to identify and reach an agreement with a service provider or individuals with the expertise possessed by the Administrator. Even if we are able to retain a comparable service provider or individuals to perform such services, whether internal or external, their integration into our business and lack of familiarity with our investment objective and portfolio could result in additional costs and time delays that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Investments\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair our portfolio companies and defaults by our portfolio companies will harm our operating results.\nMany of our portfolio companies are susceptible to economic slowdowns or recessions and could be unable to repay our loans during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions could decrease the value of collateral securing any of our loans and the value of any equity investments. A severe recession could further decrease the value of such collateral and result in losses of value in our portfolio and a decrease in our revenues, net income, assets and net worth. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us. These events could prevent us from increasing our investments and harm our operating results.\nAny deterioration of general economic conditions could lead to significant declines in corporate earnings or loan performance, and the ability of corporate borrowers to service their debt, any of which could trigger a period of global economic slowdown, and have an adverse impact on our performance and financial results, and the value and the liquidity of our investments. In an economic downturn, we could have non-performing assets or an increase in non-performing assets, and we would anticipate that the value of our portfolio would decrease during these periods. Failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by lenders to a portfolio company, including us, could lead to defaults and, potentially, acceleration of payments on such loans and foreclosure on the assets representing\nTALE OF CONTENTS\ncollateral for the portfolio companys obligations. Cross default provisions under other agreements could be triggered and thus limit the portfolio companys ability to satisfy its obligations under any debt that we hold and affect the value of any equity securities we own. We would expect to incur expenses to the extent necessary to seek recovery upon default or to negotiate new terms with a portfolio company following or in anticipation of a default.\nInflation could adversely affect the business, results of operations and financial condition of our portfolio companies.\nCertain of our portfolio companies are in industries that could be impacted by inflation. If such portfolio companies are unable to pass any increases in their costs of operations along to their customers, it could adversely affect their operating results and impact their ability to pay interest and principal on our loans, particularly if interest rates rise in response to inflation. In addition, any projected future decreases in our portfolio companies operating results due to inflation could adversely impact the fair value of those investments. Any decreases in the fair value of our investments could result in future realized or unrealized losses and therefore reduce our net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations.\nOur debt investments are risky and we could lose all or part of our investments.\nThe debt that we invest in is typically not initially rated by any rating agency, but we believe that if such investments were rated, they would be below investment grade (rated lower than Baa3 by Moodys Investors Service, lower than BBB- by Fitch Ratings or lower than BBB- by Standard & Poors Ratings Services), which under the guidelines established by these entities is an indication of having predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Bonds that are rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as high yield bonds or junk bonds. Therefore, our investments could result in an above average amount of risk and volatility or loss of principal.\nOur investments in leveraged portfolio companies are risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment.\nInvestment in leveraged companies involves a number of significant risks. Leveraged companies in which we invest could have limited financial resources and could be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that we hold. These companies could be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants and their leverage could impair their ability to finance their future operations and capital needs. As a result, these companies flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to take advantage of business opportunities could be limited. Such developments could be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of any collateral and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing any guarantees that we could have obtained in connection with our investment. Smaller leveraged companies also could have less predictable operating results and could require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance their expansion or maintain their competitive position.\nOur investments in private and middle-market portfolio companies are risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment.\nInvestment in private and middle-market companies involves a number of significant risks. Generally, little public information exists about these companies, and we rely on the ability of GC Advisors investment professionals to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these companies. If GC Advisors is unable to uncover all material information about these companies, it would not be able to make a fully informed investment decision and we could lose money on our investments. Compared to larger companies, middle-market companies typically have shorter operating histories, more limited financial resources, newer technologies and/or products, smaller market shares, less experienced management teams and less predictable operating results, and often participate in quickly evolving markets, and are more reliant on a small number of products, managers or clients. Middle-market companies could also require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position and could have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs, which could limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity. In addition, the middle-market companies in which we invest could be subject to governmental and non-governmental regulations, including by federal and state regulators and various self-regulatory organizations and the costs of complying with these laws and regulations could be more material to the company as compared to a larger company. If a company in which we directly or indirectly invest fails to comply with an applicable regulatory regime, it could be subject to fines, injunctions, operating restrictions or criminal prosecution, any of which could materially and adversely affect the value of our investment. We will not control a portfolio companys management or the manner in which a companys management addresses the companys risks except in the event that a portfolio company defaults on its loan from us and we seek to enforce our security interest. In addition, middle-market companies often require additional financing to expand or maintain their competitive position, and they could have a more difficult time obtaining additional capital than larger companies.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nAn important concern in making investments is the possibility of material misrepresentation or omission on the part of the portfolio company. Such inaccuracy or incompleteness can adversely affect, among other things, the valuation of collateral, other debt obligations, our ability to perfect or effectuate a lien on the collateral securing a loan or other debt obligation, the financial condition of the issuer, or the business prospects of the issuer. We will rely upon the accuracy and completeness of representations made by portfolio companies to the extent reasonable. However, there can be no guarantee that such representations are accurate or complete.\nIf the issuer of securities purchased by us does not perform to GC Advisors expectations, the value of its equity and debt securities would likely decline and the issuer could default on its obligations. Poor performance can be caused by a number of factors, including failures of management, competitive pressures, pressure by customers and suppliers, labor unrest, or force majeure events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. While GC Advisors intends to invest in portfolio companies in industries that it believes are resistant to recessions, there can be no assurance that such portfolio companies will not be adversely affected by other market or economic conditions.\nThe value of our investments in loans will likely be detrimentally affected to the extent a borrower defaults on its obligations, there is insufficient collateral, and/or there are extensive legal and other costs incurred in collecting on a defaulted loan. GC Advisors will attempt to minimize this risk, for example, by maintaining low loan-to-liquidation values with each loan and the collateral underlying the loan. However, there can be no assurance that the liquidation value assigned by GC Advisors would be realized by the portfolio company upon liquidation, nor can there be any assurance that such collateral will retain its value. In addition, certain of our loans will be supported, in whole or in part, by personal guarantees made by the borrower or an affiliate of the borrower. If such guarantee is called and the guarantor fails to meet its obligations under the guarantee, the amount realizable with respect to a loan will generally be detrimentally affected. There could be a monetary as well as a time cost involved in collecting on defaulted loans and, if applicable, taking possession of various types of collateral. In addition, any activity deemed to be active lending/origination by us could subject it to additional regulation.\nAn investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including, but not limited to, the lack of available information about these companies.\nWe invest primarily in privately held companies. Because private companies have reduced access to the capital markets, such companies could have diminished capital resources and ability to withstand financial distress. Often, the depth and breadth of experience of management in private companies tends to be less than that at public companies, which makes such companies more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a smaller group of persons and/or persons with less depth and breadth of experience. Therefore, the decisions made by such management teams and/or the departure of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the portfolio company and, as a result our investments.\nWe would be subject to risks if we are required to assume operation of portfolio companies upon default.\nWe, together with other funds managed by GC Advisors and its affiliates, would be expected to take over a portfolio company if the company defaults on its loans. Depending on factors including the health of the economy, the credit cycle, and the portfolio companies various industries, it is reasonable to assume that portfolio companies will default over time, and this risk is significantly increased by the COVID-19 pandemic. In such circumstances, we and the other funds would likely seek to enforce our rights under the applicable credit documentation and could opt to take over such portfolio companies. When a portfolio company is taken over, we and the other funds and their investors are subject to different risks than we are as holders of interests in loans to such portfolio company. Operating a portfolio company, even for a limited period of time pending the sale of collateral, can distract senior personnel of GC Advisors and its affiliates from their normal business. Additionally, defaulting portfolio companies often require additional capital to be effectively turned around. There is no guarantee that any defaulting portfolio company can be turned around or that our investments in such portfolio company will be successful. Finally, operating a portfolio company could subject us to potential liabilities, including management, employment, and/or environmental liabilities.\nThe lack of liquidity in our investments could adversely affect our business.\nThe debt to which we are primarily exposed is expected to consist predominantly of loans and notes that are obligations of corporations, partnerships or other entities. This debt often has no, or only a limited, trading market. The investment in illiquid debt will often restrict our ability to dispose of investments in a timely fashion, for a fair price, or at all. If an underlying issuer of debt experiences an adverse event, this illiquidity would make it more difficult for us to sell such debt, and we could instead be required to pursue a workout or alternate way out of the\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nposition. To the extent debt in a portfolio company is also held by other third-party investors, we would generally have limited control over a workout or alternate means of disposition and the person(s) having such control could have interests that are not aligned with ours. We would likely also face other restrictions on our ability to liquidate an investment in a portfolio company to the extent that we, GC Advisors, Golub Capital or any of its affiliates have material non-public information regarding such portfolio company.\nPrice declines and illiquidity in the corporate debt markets could adversely affect the fair value of our portfolio investments, reducing our net asset value through increased net unrealized depreciation.\nAs a business development company, we are required to carry our investments at market value or, if no market value is ascertainable, at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors. The fair value methodology utilized is in accordance with the fair value principles established by the ASC Topic 820. Our board of directors uses the services of one or more independent service providers to review the valuation of our illiquid investments. Valuations reflect significant events that affect the value of the instruments. As part of the valuation process, we could take into account the following types of factors, if relevant, in determining the fair value of our investments:\na comparison of the portfolio companys securities to publicly traded securities;\nthe enterprise value of the portfolio company;\nthe nature and realizable value of any collateral;\nthe portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow;\nthe markets in which the portfolio company does business; and\nchanges in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that could affect the price at which similar investments could be made in the future and other relevant factors.\nThe fair value measurement seeks to approximate the price that would be received for an investment on a current sale and assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for such asset or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for such asset, which could be a hypothetical market, and excludes transaction costs. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation. We record decreases in the market values or fair values of our investments as unrealized depreciation. Declines in prices and liquidity in the corporate debt markets could result in significant net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. The effect of all of these factors on our portfolio could reduce our net asset value by increasing net unrealized depreciation in our portfolio. Depending on market conditions, we could incur substantial realized losses and could suffer additional unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because orderly markets currently do not exist for some investments, and because valuations, and particularly valuations of private investments and private companies, require judgment, are inherently uncertain, could fluctuate over short periods and are often based on estimates, our determinations of the fair value of investments could differ materially from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments.\nOur portfolio companies could prepay loans, which could reduce our yields if capital returned cannot be invested in transactions with equal or greater expected yields.\nThe loans in our investment portfolio could be prepaid at any time, generally with little advance notice. Whether a loan is prepaid will depend both on the continued positive performance of the portfolio company and the existence of favorable financing market conditions that allow such company the ability to replace existing financing with less expensive capital. As market conditions change, we do not know when, and if, prepayment could be possible for each portfolio company. Certain fixed-income securities are subject to the risk of unanticipated prepayment. Prepayment risk is the risk that, when interest rates fall, the issuer will redeem the security prior to the securitys expected maturity. It is possible that we will reinvest the proceeds from such a redemption at a lower interest rate, resulting in less income to us. Securities subject to prepayment risk generally offer less potential for gains when prevailing interest rates fall. If we buy those securities at a premium, accelerated prepayments on those securities could cause us to lose a portion of its principal investment. The impact of prepayments on the price of a security can be difficult to predict and could increase the securitys price volatility.\nWe are subject to credit and default risk and our portfolio companies could be unable to repay or refinance outstanding principal on their loans at or prior to maturity.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nCredit risk refers to the likelihood that a borrower will default in the payment of principal and/or interest. Financial strength and solvency of a borrower are the primary factors influencing credit risk. Lack or inadequacy of collateral or credit enhancement for a debt instrument could also affect its credit risk. Credit risk can change over the life of a loan, and securities and other debt instruments that are rated by rating agencies can be downgraded. This risk and the risk of default is increased to the extent that the loan documents do not require the portfolio companies to pay down the outstanding principal of such debt prior to maturity, which is expected to be a common feature among many of our loan investments. Investments with a deferred interest feature, such as original issue discount income and payment-in-kind interest, could represent a higher credit risk than investments that must pay interest in full in cash on a regular basis.\nA significant downturn in the economy or a particular economic sector could have a significant impact on the business prospects of the portfolio companies to which we are exposed, whether directly or indirectly. Such developments could adversely affect the ability of such companies to comply with their loan repayment obligations. It is possible that the issuer of a note or other instrument in which we invest could default on its debts, in which case we could lose most or all of our investment in that instrument, subjecting us to significant loss. The risk and magnitude of losses associated with defaults could be increased where the instrument is leveraged.\nWe have not yet identified the portfolio company investments we will acquire and we could have difficulty sourcing investment opportunities.\nWhile we currently hold a portfolio of investments, we have not yet identified additional potential investments for our portfolio that we will acquire with the proceeds of any offering of securities or repayments of investments currently in our portfolio. Privately negotiated investments in loans and illiquid securities or private middle-market companies require substantial due diligence and structuring, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will achieve our anticipated investment pace. As a result, investors will not be able to evaluate any future portfolio company investments prior to purchasing our securities. Additionally, GC Advisors selects all of our investments, and our stockholders will have no input with respect to such investment decisions. These factors increase the uncertainty, and thus the risk, of investing in our securities. We anticipate that we will use substantially all of the net proceeds of any sale of our securities within approximately six months following the completion of any sale of our securities, depending on the availability of appropriate investment opportunities consistent with our investment objectives and market conditions. Until such appropriate investment opportunities can be found, we could also invest the net proceeds in cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less from the date of investment. We expect these temporary investments to earn yields substantially lower than the income that we expect to receive in respect of our targeted investment types. As a result, any distributions we make during this period could be substantially smaller than the distributions that we expect to pay when our portfolio is fully invested.\nWe are a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act and, therefore we are not limited with respect to the proportion of our assets that could be invested in securities of a single issuer.\nWe are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, which means that we are not limited by the 1940 Act with respect to the proportion of our assets that we could invest in securities of a single issuer. To the extent that we assume large positions in the securities of a small number of issuers, our net asset value could fluctuate to a greater extent than that of a diversified investment company as a result of changes in the financial condition or the markets assessment of the issuer. We could also be more susceptible to any single economic or regulatory occurrence than a diversified investment company. Beyond our asset diversification requirements as a RIC under the Code, we do not have fixed guidelines for diversification, and our investments could be concentrated in relatively few portfolio companies. Although we are classified as a non-diversified investment company within the meaning of the 1940 Act, we maintain the flexibility to operate as a diversified investment company and have done so for an extended period of time.\nOur portfolio could be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries, which will subject us to a risk of significant loss if any of these companies defaults on its obligations under any of its debt instruments or if there is a downturn in a particular industry.\nIt is possible that our portfolio could be concentrated in a limited number of portfolio companies and industries. As a result, our interests could be impaired by the concentration of our investments in any one obligor or obligors in a particular industry or geographic location in the event that such obligor, industry or geographic location were to experience adverse business conditions or other adverse events, including the effects of a global health pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, defaults could be highly correlated with particular obligors, industries\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nor geographic locations. If loans involving a particular obligor, industry or geographic location represent more than a small proportion of our portfolio, and that obligor, industry or geographic location were to experience difficulties that would affect payments on the loans, the overall timing and amount of collections on the loans held by us could differ from what was expected.\nWe could hold the debt securities of leveraged companies that could, due to the significant volatility of such companies, enter into bankruptcy proceedings.\nLeveraged companies could experience bankruptcy or similar financial distress, and the risk of these events would be expected to significantly increase upon the occurrence of adverse events, including, for example, the COVID-19 pandemic or an inflationary economic environment. The bankruptcy process has a number of significant inherent risks. Many events in a bankruptcy proceeding are products of contested matters and adversarial proceedings and are beyond the control of the creditors. A bankruptcy filing by an issuer could have adverse and permanent effects on the issuer. If the proceeding is converted to a liquidation, the value of the issuer will not necessarily equal the liquidation value that was believed to exist at the time of the investment. A bankruptcy or other workout, often raises conflicts of interest (including, for example, conflicts over proposed waivers and amendments to debt covenants), including between investors who hold different types of interests in the applicable company. The duration of a bankruptcy proceeding is also difficult to predict, and a creditors return on investment can be adversely affected by delays until the plan of reorganization or liquidation ultimately becomes effective. The administrative costs of a bankruptcy proceeding are frequently high and are paid out of the debtors estate prior to any return to creditors. Because the standards for classification of claims under bankruptcy law are vague, our influence with respect to the class of securities or other obligations it owns could be reduced by increases in the number and monetary value of claims in the same class or by different classification and treatment. In the early stages of the bankruptcy process, it is often difficult to estimate the extent of, or even to identify, any contingent claims that might be made. In addition, certain claims that have priority by law (for example, claims for taxes) can be substantial.\nDepending on the facts and circumstances of our investments and the extent of our involvement in the management of a portfolio company, upon the bankruptcy of a portfolio company, a bankruptcy court could recharacterize our debt investments as equity interests and subordinate all or a portion of our claim to that of other creditors. This could occur even though we have structured our investment as senior debt.\nOur failure to make follow-on investments in our portfolio companies could impair the value of our portfolio.\nFollowing an initial investment in a portfolio company, we could make additional investments in that portfolio company as follow-on investments, in seeking to:\nincrease or maintain in whole or in part our position as a creditor or equity ownership percentage in a portfolio company;\nexercise warrants, options or convertible securities that were acquired in the original or subsequent financing; or\npreserve or enhance the value of our investment.\nWe have discretion to make follow-on investments, subject to the availability of capital resources. Failure on our part to make follow-on investments could, in some circumstances, jeopardize the continued viability of a portfolio company and our initial investment, or could result in a missed opportunity for us to increase our participation in a successful portfolio company. Even if we have sufficient capital to make a desired follow-on investment, we could elect not to make a follow-on investment because we do not want to increase our level of risk, because we prefer other opportunities or because of regulatory or other considerations. Our ability to make follow-on investments could also be limited by GC Advisors allocation policy.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nBecause we generally do not hold controlling equity interests in our portfolio companies, we generally will not be able to exercise control over our portfolio companies or to prevent decisions by management of our portfolio companies that could decrease the value of our investments.\nTo the extent we do not hold controlling equity positions in our portfolio companies, we are subject to the risk that a portfolio company makes business decisions with which we disagree, and that the management and/or stockholders of a portfolio company could take risks or otherwise act in ways that are adverse to our interests. Due to the lack of liquidity of the debt and equity investments that we typically hold in our portfolio companies, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to dispose of our investments in the event we disagree with the actions of a portfolio company and could therefore suffer a decrease in the value of our investments.\nOur portfolio companies could incur debt that ranks equally with, or senior to, our investments in such companies and such portfolio companies could fail to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debt obligations to us.\nWe have invested and intend to invest a portion of our capital in second lien and subordinated loans issued by our portfolio companies, and we could have exposure to a variety of debt that captures particular layers of a borrowers credit structure, such as last out or second lien debt, or other subordinated investments that rank below other obligations of the borrower in right of payment. Subordinated investments are subject to greater risk of loss than senior obligations where there are adverse changes to the financial condition of the borrower or a decline in general economic conditions. Subordinated investments could expose us to particular risks in a distress scenario, such as the risk that creditors are not aligned. Holders of subordinated investments generally have less ability to affect the results of a distressed scenario than holders of more senior investments. Additionally, lenders to companies operating in workout modes are, in certain circumstances, subject to potential liabilities that could exceed the amount of such loan purchased by us.\nWe have made in the past, and could make in the future, unsecured loans to portfolio companies, meaning that such loans will not benefit from any interest in collateral of such companies. Liens on a portfolio companys collateral, if any, will secure the portfolio companys obligations under its outstanding secured debt and could secure certain future debt that is permitted to be incurred by the portfolio company under its secured loan agreements. The holders of obligations secured by such liens will generally control the liquidation of, and be entitled to receive proceeds from, any realization of such collateral to repay their obligations in full before us. In addition, the value of such collateral in the event of liquidation will depend on market and economic conditions, the availability of buyers and other factors. There can be no assurance that the proceeds, if any, from sales of such collateral would be sufficient to satisfy our unsecured loan obligations after payment in full of all loans secured by collateral. If such proceeds were not sufficient to repay the outstanding secured loan obligations, then our unsecured claims would rank equally with the unpaid portion of such secured creditors claims against the portfolio companys remaining assets, if any.\nThe rights we could have with respect to the collateral securing any junior priority loans we make to our portfolio companies could also be limited pursuant to the terms of one or more intercreditor agreements that we enter into with the holders of senior debt. Under a typical intercreditor agreement, at any time that obligations that have the benefit of the first priority liens are outstanding, any of the following actions that could be taken in respect of the collateral will be at the direction of the holders of the obligations secured by the first priority liens:\nthe ability to cause the commencement of enforcement proceedings against the collateral;\nthe ability to control the conduct of such proceedings;\nthe approval of amendments to collateral documents;\nreleases of liens on the collateral; and\nwaivers of past defaults under collateral documents.\nWe will not always have the ability to control or direct such actions, even if our rights as junior lenders are adversely affected.\nThe disposition of our investments could result in contingent liabilities.\nA significant portion of our investments involve private securities. In connection with the disposition of an investment in private securities, we could be required to make representations about the business and financial affairs of the portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business. We could also be\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nrequired to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations turn out to be inaccurate or with respect to potential liabilities. These arrangements could result in contingent liabilities that ultimately result in funding obligations that we must satisfy through our return of payments previously received by us.\nGC Advisors liability is limited, and we have agreed to indemnify GC Advisors against certain liabilities, which could lead GC Advisors to act in a riskier manner on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the collateral management agreements for each of the 2014 Debt Securitization (prior to the 2014 Notes redemption), 2018 Debt Securitization, GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization and 2020 Debt Securitization (prior to the 2020 Notes redemption), GC Advisors does not assume any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under those agreements, and it is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow GC Advisors advice or recommendations. Under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement, and each of the collateral management agreements GC Advisors, its officers, members, personnel and any person controlling or controlled by GC Advisors are not liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiarys stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the collateral management agreements, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of GC Advisors duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the collateral management agreements. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify GC Advisors and each of its officers, directors, members, managers and employees from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the collateral management agreements, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of such persons duties under the Investment Advisory Agreement, and the collateral management agreements. These protections could lead GC Advisors to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.\nWe could be subject to risks related to investments in non-U.S. companies.\nWe have invested and continue to make investments in issuers located outside the United States. Investments in issuers located outside the United States that are generally denominated in non-U.S. currencies involve both risks and opportunities not typically associated with investing in securities of United States companies. The legal and regulatory environments often have material differences, particularly as to bankruptcy and reorganization. Other considerations include changes in exchange rates and exchange control regulations, political and social instability, general economic conditions, expropriation, imposition of non-U.S. taxes, less liquid markets and less available information than is generally the case in the United States, higher transaction costs, foreign government restrictions, less government supervision of exchanges, brokers and issuers, greater risks associated with counterparties and settlement, less developed bankruptcy laws, difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations, lack of uniform accounting and auditing standards and greater price volatility. Among the factors that could affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. We could employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks, but we cannot assure you that such strategies will be effective or without risk to us. As of September 30, 2022, we were invested in securities of thirty-four non-U.S. companies. Securities issued by non-U.S. companies are not qualifying assets under the 1940 Act, and we could invest in non-U.S. companies, including emerging markets issuers, to the limited extent such investments are permitted under the 1940 Act.\nWe could be subject to risks if we engage in hedging transactions and could become subject to risks if we invest in foreign securities.\nUnder the 1940 Act, a business development company is restricted from acquiring any asset other than assets of the type listed in the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the companys total assets. In order for our investments to be classified as qualifying assets, among other requirements, such investments must be in issuers organized under the laws of, and which have their principal place of business in, any state of the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands or any other possession of the United States.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWe can invest in non-U.S. companies, including emerging market issuers, to the limited extent such investments are permitted under the 1940 Act. We expect that these investments would focus on the same types of investments that we make in U.S. middle-market companies and accordingly would be complementary to our overall strategy and enhance the diversity of our holdings. Investing in securities of emerging market issuers involves many risks including economic, social, political, financial, tax and security conditions in the emerging market, potential inflationary economic environments, regulation by foreign governments, different accounting standards and political uncertainties. Economic, social, political, financial, tax and security conditions also could negatively affect the value of emerging market companies. These factors could include changes in the emerging market governments economic and fiscal policies, the possible imposition of, or changes in, currency exchange laws or other laws or restrictions applicable to the emerging market companies or investments in their securities and the possibility of fluctuations in the rate of exchange between currencies. Any of our portfolio company investments that are denominated in foreign currencies will be subject to the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which fluctuations could adversely affect our performance.\nWe have and could in the future enter into hedging transactions to the limited extent such transactions are permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. Engaging in hedging transactions or investing in foreign securities would entail additional risks to our stockholders. We could, for example, use instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and floors and, if we were to invest in foreign securities, we could use instruments such as forward contracts or currency options in currencies selected to hedge against fluctuations in the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in currency exchange rates and market interest rates. We could also, for example, borrow under a credit facility in currencies selected to minimize our foreign currency exposure. Use of these hedging instruments could include counterparty credit risk. In each such case, we generally would seek to hedge against fluctuations of the relative values of our portfolio positions from changes in market interest rates or currency exchange rates. While hedging transactions can reduce such risks, they generally will not be designed to prevent all loss from our position. There also could be barriers that prevent us from entering into certain hedging transactions. These barriers will not necessarily impact other investment funds managed by GC Advisors or its affiliates. Hedging transactions could result in a lower overall performance for us than if it had not entered into hedging transactions and generally introduces new risks, such as counterparty risk and greater illiquidity. In addition, we are permitted to borrow funds in one or more foreign currencies as a form of protection against currency risk. The use of such financing could create new risks not traditionally associated with credit facilities or other forms of leverage. Conversely, to the extent that we do not enter into hedging transactions, borrower defaults and fluctuations in currency exchange rates or interest rates could result in poorer overall performance for us than if it had entered into such hedging transactions.\nThe success of any hedging transactions that we enter into will depend on our ability to correctly predict movements in currency and interest rates. Therefore, while we could enter into hedging transactions to seek to reduce currency exchange rate and interest rate risks, unanticipated changes in currency exchange rates or interest rates could result in poorer overall investment performance than if we had not engaged in any such hedging transactions. In addition, the degree of correlation between price movements of the instruments used in a hedging strategy and price movements in the portfolio positions being hedged could vary. Moreover, for a variety of reasons, we would not necessarily seek to (or be able to) establish a perfect correlation between the hedging instruments and the portfolio holdings being hedged. Any such imperfect correlation could prevent us from achieving the intended hedge and expose us to risk of loss. In addition, it is often not possible to hedge fully or perfectly against currency fluctuations affecting the value of securities denominated in non-U.S. currencies because the value of those securities would likely fluctuate as a result of factors not related to currency fluctuations. Our ability to engage in hedging transactions could also be limited under the Code as well as adversely affected by rules adopted by the CFTC.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWe could suffer losses from our equity investments.\nWhile our investment portfolio will be focused on loans, we are also permitted to invest in equity securities. Such investments are expected to represent minority ownership in the issuer and are subordinate to the claims of the issuers creditors and, to the extent such securities are common securities, to preferred equity holders. The value of equity securities is dependent on the performance of the issuer and can fluctuate based on the issuers financial performance, market conditions, and overall economic conditions. Dividends paid to equity holders could be suspended or cancelled at any time, and minority owners could have limited protections. We also could be unable to realize any value if a portfolio company does not have a liquidity event, such as a sale of the business, recapitalization or public offering, which would allow us to sell our underlying equity interests. In addition, if an issuer of equity securities in which we have invested sells additional shares of its equity securities, our interest in the issuer will be diluted and the value of our investment could decrease. For the foregoing reasons, investments in equity securities can be highly speculative and carry a substantial risk of loss of investment. Investments in equity securities can carry additional risks or have other characteristics that require different structuring. As such, these investments can be made directly, or indirectly through blocker entities or otherwise.\nWe could be subject to lender liability claims with respect to our portfolio company investments.\nA number of judicial decisions have upheld judgments for borrowers against lending institutions on the basis of various legal theories, collectively termed lender liability. Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has violated a duty (whether implied or contractual) of good faith, commercial reasonableness and fair dealing or a similar duty owed to the borrower, or has assumed an excessive degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or stockholders. We could be required to defend allegations of lender liability from time to time.\nLoans to companies operating in workout modes or under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code are, in certain circumstances, subject to certain potential liabilities that could exceed the amount of such loan purchased by us. Under common law principles that in some cases form the basis for lender liability claims, if a lender or bondholder (i) intentionally takes an action that results in the undercapitalization of a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, (ii) engages in other inequitable conduct to the detriment of such other creditors, (iii) engages in fraud with respect to, or makes misrepresentations to, such other creditors or (iv) uses its influence as a stockholder to dominate or control a borrower to the detriment of other creditors of such borrower, a court could elect to subordinate the claim of the offending lender or bondholder to the claims of the disadvantaged creditor or creditors, a remedy called equitable subordination. Because of the nature of the loans, the loans could be subject to claims of subordination.\nRisks Relating to Investors in Our Securities\nInvesting in our securities could involve an above average degree of risk.\nThe investments we make in accordance with our investment objective could result in a higher amount of risk than alternative investment options and a higher risk of volatility or loss of principal. Our investments in portfolio companies involve higher levels of risk, and therefore, an investment in our securities may not be suitable for someone with a lower risk tolerance.\nShares of closed-end investment companies, including business development companies, often trade at a discount to their net asset value.\nShares of closed-end investment companies, including business development companies, could trade at a discount from net asset value. This characteristic of closed-end investment companies and business development companies is separate and distinct from the risk that our net asset value per share could decline. We cannot predict whether our common stock will trade at, above or below net asset value.\nThere is a risk that investors in our equity securities will not receive distributions or that our distributions will not grow over time and a portion of our distributions could be a return of capital.\nWe intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution. We cannot assure you that we will achieve investment results that will allow us to make a specified level of cash distributions or year-to-year increases in cash distributions. Our ability to pay distributions could be adversely affected by the impact of one or more of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. Due to the asset coverage test applicable to us\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nunder the 1940 Act as a business development company, we could be limited in our ability to make distributions. In addition, all distributions are and will be paid at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our earnings, financial condition, maintenance of our RIC status, compliance with applicable business development company regulations and such other factors as our board of directors could deem relevant from time to time. If we declare a distribution and if more stockholders opt to receive cash distributions rather than participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, we could be forced to sell some of our investments in order to make cash distribution payments. In the event that we encounter delays in locating suitable investment opportunities, we could also pay all or a substantial portion of our distributions from the proceeds of private placements of our common stock or from borrowings in anticipation of future cash flow, which could constitute a return of stockholders capital. To the extent we make distributions to stockholders that include a return of capital, such portion of the distribution essentially constitutes a return of the stockholders investment. Although such return of capital is generally not currently taxable, such distributions would generally decrease a stockholders basis in our common stock and could therefore increase such stockholders tax liability for capital gains upon the future sale or other disposition of such common stock. A return of capital distribution could cause a stockholder to recognize a capital gain from the sale of our common stock even if the stockholder sells its shares for less than the original purchase price. Distributions from borrowings could also reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in our portfolio companies.\nWe have not established any limit on the amount of funds we can use from available sources, such as borrowings, if any, or proceeds from private placements of our common stock, to fund distributions (which could reduce the amount of capital we ultimately invest in assets).\nAny distributions made from sources other than cash flow from operations or relying on fee or expense reimbursement waivers, if any, from GC Advisors or the Administrator are not based on our investment performance, and can only be sustained if we achieve positive investment performance in future periods and/or GC Advisors or the Administrator continues to make such expense reimbursements, if any. The extent to which we pay distributions from sources other than cash flow from operations will depend on various factors, including the level of participation in our dividend reinvestment plan, how quickly we invest the proceeds from any offerings of our securities and the performance of our investments. There can be no assurance that we will achieve such performance in order to sustain any level of distributions, or be able to pay distributions at all. GC Advisors and the Administrator have no obligation to waive fees or receipt of expense reimbursements, if any.\nThe market price of our securities could fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price and liquidity of the market for our securities could be significantly affected by numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include:\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of business development companies or other companies in our sector, which are not necessarily related to the operating performance of the companies;\nchanges in regulatory policies, accounting pronouncements or tax guidelines, particularly with respect to RICs and business development companies;\nloss of our qualification as a RIC or business development company;\nchanges in market interest rates and decline in the prices of debt,\nchanges in earnings or variations in operating results;\nchanges in the value of our portfolio investments;\nchanges in accounting guidelines governing valuation of our investments;\nany shortfall in revenue or net income or any increase in losses from levels expected by investors or securities analysts;\ndeparture of GC Advisors or any of its affiliates key personnel;\noperating performance of companies comparable to us;\ngeneral economic trends and other external factors; and\nloss of a major funding source.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nThe Unsecured Notes are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have incurred or could incur in the future.\nThe Unsecured Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the Unsecured Notes are effectively subordinated, or junior, to any secured indebtedness or other obligations we or our subsidiaries have outstanding as of the date of issuance of the Unsecured Notes or that we or our subsidiaries could incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured in respect of which we subsequently grant security) to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. A substantial portion of our assets are currently pledged as collateral under the Debt Securitizations and Revolving Credit Facilities. In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries could assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness in order to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets could be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Unsecured Notes. As of September 30, 2022, we had an aggregate of approximately $1.6 billion of outstanding borrowings under the Debt Securitizations and the Revolving Credit Facilities, all of which are secured and thus effectively senior to the Unsecured Notes.\nThe Unsecured Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our\nsubsidiaries.\nThe Unsecured Notes are obligations exclusively of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Unsecured Notes and the Unsecured Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we could acquire or create in the future. The assets of such subsidiaries are not directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Unsecured Notes.\nExcept to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Unsecured Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the Unsecured Notes are structurally subordinated, or junior, to the Debt Securitizations, the Revolving Credit Facilities and other liabilities (including trade payables) incurred by any of our existing or future subsidiaries, financing vehicles or similar facilities. All of the existing indebtedness of our subsidiaries is structurally senior to the Unsecured Notes.\nIn addition, our subsidiaries and any additional subsidiaries that we could form could incur substantial additional\nindebtedness in the future, all of which would be structurally senior to the Unsecured Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Unsecured Notes contains limited protection for holders of the Unsecured Notes.\nThe indenture governing the Unsecured Notes offers limited protection to holders of the Unsecured\nNotes. The terms of the indenture and the Unsecured Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have a material adverse impact on an investment in the Unsecured Notes. In particular, the terms of the indenture and the Unsecured Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to:\nissue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be pari passu, or equal, in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, (3) indebtedness or other obligations of ours that are guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore are structurally senior to the Unsecured Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or other obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the Unsecured Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligations that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) and (2) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, as such obligations could be amended or superseded, giving effect to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from incurring additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 150% after such borrowings;\nTALE OF CONTENTS\npay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the Unsecured Notes;\nsell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets);\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\ncreate liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\nmake investments; or\ncreate restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries.\nFurthermore, the terms of the indenture and the Unsecured Notes do not protect holders of the Unsecured Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity other than certain events of default under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes.\nOur ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions are not limited by the terms of the Unsecured Notes and could have important consequences for holders of the Unsecured Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Unsecured Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the Unsecured Notes.\nCertain of our current debt instruments include more protections for their holders than the indenture and the\nUnsecured Notes. In addition, other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its\nholders than the indenture and the Unsecured Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The\nissuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels\nand prices of the Unsecured Notes.\nIf an active trading market for the Unsecured Notes does not develop, holders may not be able to resell them.\nThe Unsecured Notes could or could not have an active trading market. We do not intend to apply for listing of the Unsecured Notes on any securities exchange or for quotation of the Unsecured Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. If no active trading market develops, holders may not be able to resell the Unsecured Notes at their fair market value or at all. If the Unsecured Notes are traded after their initial issuance, they could trade at a discount from their initial offering price depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, our credit ratings, general economic conditions, our financial condition, performance and prospects and other factors. Any market-making activity will be subject to limits imposed by law. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid trading market will develop for the Unsecured Notes, that holders will be able to sell the Unsecured Notes at a particular time or that the price received when sold will be favorable. To the extent an active trading market does not develop, the liquidity and trading price for the Unsecured Notes could be harmed. Accordingly, holders could be required to bear the financial risk of an investment in the Unsecured Notes for an indefinite period of time.\nIf we default on our obligations to pay our other indebtedness, we could not be able to make payments on the Unsecured Notes.\nAny default under the agreements governing our indebtedness, including the Debt Securitizations, the Revolving Credit Facilities or other indebtedness to which we are a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Unsecured Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Unsecured Notes.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required\npayments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing our indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facilities or other debt we could incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nIf our operating performance declines, we could in the future need to seek to obtain waivers from the required lenders under the Revolving Credit Facilities or the required holders of the Debt Securitizations or other debt that we could incur in the future, to avoid being in default. If we breach our covenants under the Debt Securitizations, the Revolving Credit Facilities or other debt and seek a waiver, we could not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders or holders. If this occurs, we would be in default and our lenders or debt holders could exercise their rights as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nIf we are unable to repay debt, lenders or holders having secured obligations, including the lenders and holders under the Debt Securitizations and the Revolving Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral securing the debt. Because the Revolving Credit Facilities have, and any future credit facilities will likely have, customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness thereunder or under any future credit facility is accelerated, we could be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. In the event holders of any debt securities we have outstanding exercise their rights to accelerate following a cross-default, those holders would be entitled to receive the principal amount of their investment, subject to any subordination arrangements that could be in place. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient liquidity to be able to repay such amounts, in which case we would be in default under the accelerated debt and holders would have the ability to sue us to recover amounts then owing.\nA downgrade, suspension or withdrawal of the credit rating assigned by a rating agency to us or the Unsecured Notes, if any, or change in the debt markets, could cause the liquidity or market value of the Unsecured Notes to decline significantly.\nOur credit ratings are an assessment by rating agencies of our ability to pay our debts when due. Consequently, real or anticipated changes in our credit ratings will generally affect the market value of the Unsecured Notes or other debt securities we could issue. These credit ratings may not reflect the potential impact of risks relating to the structure or marketing of the Unsecured Notes. Credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and could be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization in its sole discretion. Neither we nor any underwriter undertakes any obligation to maintain our credit ratings or to advise holders of the Unsecured Notes of any changes in our credit ratings.\nAn increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the market value of the Unsecured Notes.\nThe condition of the financial markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future, which could have an adverse effect on the market prices of the Unsecured Notes. In general, as market interest rates rise, debt securities bearing interest at fixed rates of interest decline in value. Consequently, if market interest rates increase, the market values of the Unsecured Notes with fixed interest rates could decline. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.\nThe optional redemption provision could materially adversely affect the return on the Unsecured Notes.\nThe Unsecured Notes are redeemable in whole or in part upon certain conditions at any time or from time to time at our option. We could choose to redeem the Unsecured Notes at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the Unsecured Notes. In this circumstance, holders may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the Unsecured Notes being redeemed.\nWe could be unable to repurchase the Unsecured Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event.\nWe could be unable to repurchase the Unsecured Notes upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event (as defined in the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes) if we do not have sufficient funds. Upon a Change of Control Repurchase Event, holders of the Unsecured Notes could require us to repurchase for cash some or all of the Unsecured Notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the Unsecured Notes being repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repurchase date. Our failure to purchase such tendered Unsecured Notes upon the occurrence of such Change of Control Repurchase Event would cause an event of default under the indenture governing the Unsecured Notes and a cross-default under the agreements governing certain of our other indebtedness, which could result in the acceleration of such indebtedness requiring us to repay that indebtedness immediately.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWe are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries in order to make payments on any debt securities that we could issue as well as to pay distributions on our common stock. Any debt securities that we issue will be structurally subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries.\nWe are a holding company and fund a majority of our investments through wholly-owned subsidiaries, and a majority of the assets that we hold directly are the equity interests in such subsidiaries, including any subordinated notes issued as part of our debt securitization transactions, which notes represent the residual claimant on distributions by the applicable securitization subsidiary. We depend upon the cash flow from our subsidiaries and the receipt of funds from them in the form of payments on any subordinated notes, dividends, and other distributions, any of which could be subject to restriction or limitations based on the organizational documents of the subsidiaries and the agreements governing the debt of any such subsidiary. In addition, because we are a holding company, any debt securities that we issue will be structurally subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries. In the event that one of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates, reorganizes, dissolves or otherwise winds up, its assets will be used first to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Consequently, any claim by us or our creditors, including holders of any debt securities that we could issue, against any subsidiary will be structurally subordinated to all of the claims of the creditors of such subsidiary. We cannot assure security holders that they will receive any payments required to be made under the terms of any debt securities that we could issue, dividends or other distributions.\nHolders of any preferred stock that we could issue will have the right to elect members of the board of directors and have class voting rights on certain matters.\nThe 1940 Act requires that holders of shares of preferred stock must be entitled as a class to elect two directors at all times and to elect a majority of the directors if dividends on such preferred stock are in arrears by two years or more, until such arrearage is eliminated. In addition, certain matters under the 1940 Act require the separate vote of the holders of any issued and outstanding preferred stock, including changes in fundamental investment restrictions and conversion to open-end status and, accordingly, preferred stockholders could veto any such changes. Restrictions imposed on the declarations and payment of dividends or other distributions to the holders of our common stock and preferred stock, both by the 1940 Act and by requirements imposed by rating agencies, might impair our ability to maintain our qualification as a RIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOur common stockholders interest in us could be diluted if they do not fully exercise subscription rights in any rights offering. In addition, if the subscription price is less than our net asset value per share, then common stockholders will experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares.\nIn the event we issue subscription rights, stockholders who do not fully exercise their subscription rights should expect that they will, at the completion of a rights offering, own a smaller proportional interest in us than would otherwise be the case if they fully exercised their rights. We cannot state precisely the amount of any such dilution in share ownership because we do not know at this time what proportion of the shares would be purchased as a result of such rights offering.\nIn addition, if the subscription price is less than the net asset value per share of our common stock, then our common stockholders would experience an immediate dilution of the aggregate net asset value of their shares as a result of the offering. The amount of any decrease in net asset value is not predictable because it is not known at this time what the subscription price and net asset value per share will be on the expiration date of a rights offering or what proportion of the shares will be purchased as a result of such rights offering. Such dilution could be substantial.\nThese dilutive effects could be exacerbated if we were to conduct multiple subscription rights offerings, particularly if such offerings were to occur over a short period of time. In addition, subscription rights offerings and the prospect of future subscription rights offerings could create downward pressure on the secondary market price of our common stock due to the potential for the issuance of shares at a price below our net asset value, without a corresponding change to our net asset value.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nOur stockholders will experience dilution in their ownership percentage if they do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan.\nAll distributions declared in cash payable to stockholders that are participants in our dividend reinvestment plan are automatically reinvested in shares of our common stock. As a result, our stockholders that do not participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will experience dilution in their ownership percentage of our common stock over time.\nOur stockholders could receive shares of our common stock as dividends, which could result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nAlthough we currently do not intend to do so, we are permitted to declare a large portion of a dividend in shares of common stock instead of cash at the election of each stockholder. Revenue Procedures issued by the IRS allow a publicly offered regulated investment company (such as us) to distribute its own stock as a dividend for the purpose of fulfilling its distribution requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied. Among other things, the aggregate amount of cash available to be distributed to all stockholders is required to be at least 10% of the total distribution, for distributions declared on or before December 31, 2022 and at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution for distributions declared on or after January 1, 2023. The Internal Revenue Service has also issued private letter rulings on cash/stock dividends paid by RICs and real estate investment trusts where the cash component is limited to 20% of the total distribution if certain requirements are satisfied. Stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend (including the portion payable in stock) as ordinary income (or, in certain circumstances, long-term capital gain) to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, stockholders could be required to pay income taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividends received. It is unclear to what extent we will be able to pay taxable dividends in cash and common stock (whether pursuant to IRS Revenue Procedures, a private letter ruling or otherwise).\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nSales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the availability of such common stock for sale, could adversely affect the prevailing market prices for our common stock. If this occurs and continues, it could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of securities should we desire to do so.\nThe trading market or market value of our publicly issued debt securities could fluctuate.\nAny publicly issued debt securities we issue will not necessarily have an established trading market. We cannot assure you that a trading market for our publicly issued debt securities will ever develop or be maintained if developed. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors could materially adversely affect the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\nthe time remaining to the maturity of these debt securities;\nthe outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities;\nthe ratings assigned by national statistical ratings agencies;\nthe general economic environment;\nthe supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any;\nthe redemption or repayment features, if any, of these debt securities;\nthe level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally; and\nmarket rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities.\nInvestors should also be aware that there could be a limited number of buyers when they decide to sell our debt securities. This too could materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities or the trading market for the debt securities.\nTerms relating to redemption could materially adversely affect the return on any debt securities that we could issue.\nIf we issue debt securities that are redeemable at our option, we could choose to redeem such debt securities at times when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In addition, if our debt securities are subject to mandatory redemption, we could be required to redeem such debt securities also at times\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nwhen prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate paid on the debt securities. In this circumstance, investors in our debt securities may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the debt securities being redeemed.\nIf we issue preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt securities, the net asset value and market value of\nour common stock could become more volatile.\nWe cannot assure you that the issuance of preferred stock and/or debt securities would result in a higher yield or return to the holders of our common stock. The issuance of preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt would likely cause the net asset value and market value of our common stock to become more volatile. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to approach the net rate of return on our investment portfolio, the benefit of leverage to the holders of our common stock would be reduced. If the dividend rate on the preferred stock, or the interest rate on the debt securities, were to exceed the net rate of return on our portfolio, the use of leverage would result in a lower rate of return to the holders of our common stock than if we had not issued the preferred stock or debt securities. Any decline in the net asset value of our investment would be borne entirely by the holders of our common stock. Therefore, if the market value of our portfolio were to decline, the leverage would result in a greater decrease in net asset value to the holders of our common stock than if we were not leveraged through the issuance of preferred stock. This decline in net asset value would also tend to cause a greater decline in the market price for our common stock.\nThere is also a risk that, in the event of a sharp decline in the value of our net assets, we would be in danger of failing to maintain required asset coverage ratios which could be required by the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or units or of a downgrade in the ratings of the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or units or our current investment income might not be sufficient to meet the dividend requirements on the preferred stock or the interest payments on the debt securities. In order to counteract such an event, we might need to liquidate investments in order to fund redemption of some or all of the preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt. In addition, we would pay (and the holders of our common stock would bear) all costs and expenses relating to the issuance and ongoing maintenance of the preferred stock, debt securities, convertible debt or any combination of these securities. Holders of preferred stock, debt securities or convertible debt could have different interests than holders of common stock and could at times have disproportionate influence over our affairs.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe are currently in a period of capital markets disruption and economic uncertainty.\nThe success of our activities is affected by general economic and market conditions, including, among others, interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws, and trade barriers. These factors could affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity of our investments. Volatility or illiquidity could impair our profitability or result in losses. These factors also could adversely affect the availability or cost of our leverage, which would result in lower returns.\nIn 2020, the U.S. capital markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption following the global outbreak of COVID-19 (also known as the coronavirus). Some economists and major investment banks have expressed concern that the continued spread of the virus globally could lead to a prolonged period of world-wide economic downturn. These disruptions in the capital markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the capital markets. Such disruptions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and future market disruptions and/or illiquidity could negatively impact us. These unfavorable economic conditions could increase our funding costs and limit our access to the capital markets, and could result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us in the future. These events could limit our investments, our ability to grow and could negatively impact our operating results and the fair values of our debt and equity investments.\nEvents outside of our control, including public health crises, could negatively affect our portfolio companies, our investment adviser and the results of our operations.\nPeriods of market volatility could occur in response to pandemics or other events outside of our control. We, GC Advisors, and the portfolio companies in which we invest in could be affected by force majeure events (i.e., events beyond the control of the party claiming that the event has occurred, such as acts of God, fire, flood, earthquakes, outbreaks of an infectious disease, pandemic or any other serious public health concern, war, terrorism, labor strikes,\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nmajor plant breakdowns, pipeline or electricity line ruptures, failure of technology, defective design and construction, accidents, demographic changes, government macroeconomic policies, social instability, etc.). Some force majeure events could adversely affect the ability of a party (including us, GC Advisors, a portfolio company or a counterparty to us, GC Advisors, or a portfolio company) to perform its obligations until it is able to remedy the force majeure event. In addition, force majeure events, such as the cessation of the operation of equipment for repair or upgrade, could similarly lead to the unavailability of essential equipment and technologies. These risks could, among other effects, adversely impact the cash flows available from a portfolio company, cause personal injury or loss of life, including to a senior manager of GC Advisors or its affiliates, damage property, or instigate disruptions of service. In addition, the cost to a portfolio company or us of repairing or replacing damaged assets resulting from such force majeure event could be considerable. It will not be possible to insure against all such events, and insurance proceeds received, if any, could be inadequate to completely or even partially cover any loss of revenues or investments, any increases in operating and maintenance expenses, or any replacements or rehabilitation of property. Certain events causing catastrophic loss could be either uninsurable, or insurable at such high rates as to adversely impact us, GC Advisors, or portfolio companies, as applicable. Force majeure events that are incapable of or are too costly to cure could have permanent adverse effects. Certain force majeure events (such as war or an outbreak of an infectious disease) could have a broader negative impact on the world economy and international business activity generally, or in any of the countries in which we invest or our portfolio companies operate specifically. Such force majeure events could result in or coincide with: increased volatility in the global securities, derivatives and currency markets; a decrease in the reliability of market prices and difficulty in valuing assets; greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; increased risk of default (by both government and private issuers); further social, economic, and political instability; nationalization of private enterprise; greater governmental involvement in the economy or in social factors that impact the economy; less governmental regulation and supervision of the securities markets and market participants and decreased monitoring of the markets by governments or self-regulatory organizations and reduced enforcement of regulations; limited, or limitations on, the activities of investors in such markets; controls or restrictions on foreign investment, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital; inability to purchase and sell investments or otherwise settle security or derivative transactions (i.e., a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates of inflation, which can last many years and have substantial negative effects on credit and securities markets as well as the economy as a whole; recessions; and difficulties in obtaining and/or enforcing legal judgments.\nAdditionally, a major governmental intervention into industry, including the nationalization of an industry or the assertion of control over one or more portfolio companies or its assets, could result in a loss to us, including if the investment in such portfolio companies is canceled, unwound or acquired (which could result in inadequate compensation). Any of the foregoing could therefore adversely affect the performance of us and our investments.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China, and spread to additional countries. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared a global emergency. At various times during the course of the pandemic, orders have been issued and lifted restricting movement within a number of large metropolitan areas, including in some instances, orders to shelter in place. The outbreak of COVID-19 and its related negative public health developments adversely affected workforces, customers, suppliers, economies and financial markets globally. The length of any resulting economic downturn and any additional waves of the disease that could exacerbate or further prolong any downturn are impossible to predict and could affect operations of GC Advisors business, including by harming GC Advisors ability to manage our investments. In addition, portfolio companies and our investments in such companies could be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic or any other pandemic, including by supply disruptions, decreases in consumer demand, loss of personnel either to sickness or movement restrictions, and the resulting global market and economic disruptions. These adverse effects could cause losses in value of our investments, adversely affecting investors.\nWe could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results.\nWe could experience fluctuations in our quarterly operating results due to a number of factors, including the interest rate payable on any borrowings and the interest rate payable on the debt securities we acquire, the default rate on such securities, the number and size of investments we originate or acquire, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets and general economic conditions. In light of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of our performance in future periods.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nPolitical uncertainty could adversely affect our business.\nU.S. and non-U.S. markets could experience political uncertainty and/or change that subjects investments to heightened risks, including, for instance, risks related to elections in the U.S., the large-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia that began in February 2022, or the effect on world leaders and governments of global health pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. These heightened risks could also include: increased risk of default (by both government and private issuers); greater social, trade, economic and political instability (including the risk of war or terrorist activity); greater governmental involvement in the economy; greater governmental supervision and regulation of the securities markets and market participants resulting in increased expenses related to compliance; greater fluctuations in currency exchange rates; controls or restrictions on foreign investment and/or trade, capital controls and limitations on repatriation of invested capital and on the ability to exchange currencies; inability to purchase and sell investments or otherwise settle security or derivative transactions (i.e., a market freeze); unavailability of currency hedging techniques; and slower clearance. During times of political uncertainty and/or change, global markets often become more volatile. There could also be a lower level of monitoring and regulation of markets while a country is experiencing political uncertainty and/or change, and the activities of investors in such markets and enforcement of existing regulations could become more limited. Markets experiencing political uncertainty and/or change could have substantial, and in some periods extremely high, rates of inflation for many years. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates typically have negative effects on such countries economies and markets. Tax laws could change materially, and any changes in tax laws could have an unpredictable effect on us, our investments and our investors. There can be no assurance that political changes will not cause us or our investors to suffer losses.\nThe impact of Brexit on our investments is uncertain and could adversely affect our business.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom, or the UK, ended its membership in the European Union, or the EU, referred to as Brexit. Following the termination of a transition period, the UK and the EU entered into a trade and cooperation agreement to govern the future relationship between the parties, which was provisionally applied as of January 1, 2021 and entered into force on May 1, 2021 following ratification by the EU. With respect to financial services, the agreement leaves decisions on equivalence and adequacy to be determined by each of the U.K. and E.U. unilaterally in due course. As a result, certain UK licensed entities are unable to provide regulated services in a number of EU jurisdictions from the end of December 2020, absent regulatory relief or other measures implemented by individual countries. Such agreement is untested and could lead to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of exacerbated volatility in both the United Kingdom and in wider European and global markets for some time. The longer term economic, legal, political and social implications of Brexit are unclear at this stage. Brexit has led to ongoing political and economic uncertainty and periods of increased volatility in both the UK and in wider European markets for some time. Brexit could lead to calls for similar referendums in other European jurisdictions, which could cause increased economic volatility in the European and global markets. This mid- to long-term uncertainty could have adverse effects on the economy generally and on our ability to earn attractive returns. In particular, currency volatility could mean that our returns are adversely affected by market movements and could make it more difficult, or more expensive, for us to execute prudent currency hedging policies. Potential decline in the value of the British Pound and/or the Euro against other currencies, along with the potential further downgrading of the UKs sovereign credit rating, could also have an impact on the performance of certain investments made in the UK or Europe.\nNew or modified laws or regulations governing our operations could adversely affect our business.\nWe and our portfolio companies are subject to regulation by laws at the U.S. federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations, as well as their interpretation, could change from time to time, including as the result of interpretive guidance or other directives from the U.S. President and others in the executive branch, and new laws, regulations and interpretations could also come into effect. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration could support an enhanced regulatory agenda that imposes greater costs on all sectors and on financial services companies in particular. Any such new or changed laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, and political uncertainty could increase regulatory uncertainty in the near term.\nThe effects of legislative and regulatory proposals directed at the financial services industry or affecting taxation, could negatively impact the operations, cash flows or financial condition of us or our portfolio companies, impose additional costs on us or our portfolio companies, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or our portfolio companies or otherwise adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies. In addition, if we\nTALE OF CONTENTS\ndo not comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could lose any licenses that we then hold for the conduct of our business and could be subject to civil fines and criminal penalties.\nWe invest in securities of issuers that are subject to governmental and non-governmental regulations, including by federal and state regulators and various self-regulatory organizations. Companies participating in regulated activities could incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations. If a company in which we invest fails to comply with an applicable regulatory regime, it could be subject to fines, injunctions, operating restrictions or criminal prosecution, any of which could materially and adversely affect the value of our investment.\nAdditionally, changes to the laws and regulations governing our operations, including those associated with RICs, could cause us to alter our investment strategy in order to avail ourselves of new or different opportunities or result in the imposition of corporate-level taxes on us. Such changes could result in material differences to our strategies and plans and could shift our investment focus from the areas of expertise of GC Advisors to other types of investments in which GC Advisors could have little or no expertise or experience. Any such changes, if they occur, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the value of your investment. If we invest in commodity interests in the future, GC Advisors could determine not to use investment strategies that trigger additional regulation by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or the CFTC, or could determine to operate subject to CFTC regulation, if applicable. If we or GC Advisors were to operate subject to CFTC regulation, we could incur additional expenses and would be subject to additional regulation.\nOn October 21, 2014, U.S. risk retention rules adopted pursuant to Section 941 of Dodd-Frank, or the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, were issued and became effective with respect to collateralized loan obligation, or CLOs, on December 24, 2016. The U.S. Risk Retention Rules require the sponsor (directly or through a majority-owned affiliate) of a debt securitization subject to such rules, such as CLOs, in the absence of an exemption, to retain an economic interest, or the Retention Interest, in the credit risk of the assets being securitized in the form of an eligible horizontal residual interest, an eligible vertical interest, or a combination thereof, in accordance with the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. Due to the interplay of the 1940 Act restrictions on principal and joint transactions and the U.S. Risk Retention Rules, we sought no-action relief to ensure that we could engage in CLO financing under the 1940 Act and the risk retention rules mandated by Section 941 of Dodd-Frank. On September 7, 2018 we received a no-action letter from the staff, or the Staff, of the Division of Investment Management of the SEC that states that the Staff would not recommend that the SEC take any enforcement action under Section 57(a) of the1940 Act, or Rule 17d-1 under the 1940 Act against us or GC Advisors if we were to acquire CLO equity as a Retention Interest in the manner described in a letter submitted to the Staff on behalf of us.\nHowever, the no-action relief we received did not address whether or not the CLO transactions described therein would satisfy the requirements of the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. As a general matter, available interpretive authority to date addressing the U.S. Risk Retention Rules applicable to CLOs is limited, and there is limited judicial decisional authority or applicable agency interpretation that has directly addressed any of the risk retention approaches taken with respect to CLOs. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the applicable federal agencies will agree that any CLO transaction we undertake, or the manner in which we hold any retention interests, complies with the U.S. Risk Retention Rules. If we ever determined that undertaking CLO transactions would subject us or any of our affiliates to unacceptable regulatory risk, our ability to execute CLOs could be limited or otherwise curtailed. Given the more attractive financing costs associated with these types of debt securitization as opposed to other types of financing available (such as traditional senior secured facilities), this would, in turn, increase our financing costs. Any associated increase in financing costs would ultimately be borne by our common stockholders.\nOver the last several years, there also has been an increase in regulatory attention to the extension of credit outside of the traditional banking sector, raising the possibility that some portion of the non-bank financial sector will be subject to new regulation. While it cannot be known at this time whether any regulation will be implemented or what form it will take, increased regulation of non-bank credit extension could negatively impact our operations, cash flows or financial condition, impose additional costs on us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.\nAs a publicly traded company, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses, including costs associated with the periodic reporting requirements applicable to a company whose securities are registered under the Exchange Act, as well as additional corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules implemented by the SEC.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nOur compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act involves significant expenditures, and non-compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act would adversely affect us and the market price of our common stock.\nUnder current SEC rules, we are required to report on our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules and regulations of the SEC. As such, we are required to review on an annual basis our internal control over financial reporting, and on a quarterly and annual basis to evaluate and disclose changes in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, we incur expenses that could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to make distributions. This process also results in a diversion of managements time and attention. We cannot ensure that our evaluation, testing and remediation process is effective or that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective. In the event that we are unable to maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related rules, we and the market price of our securities would be adversely affected.\nTechnological innovations and industry disruptions could negatively impact us.\nTechnological innovations have disrupted traditional approaches in multiple industries and can permit younger companies to achieve success and in the process disrupt markets and market practices. We can provide no assurance that new businesses and approaches will not be created that would compete with us and/or our portfolio companies or alter the market practices in which GC Advisors and its affiliates and us have been designed to function within and on which we depend on for our investment return. New approaches could damage our investments, disrupt the market in which we operate and subject us to increased competition, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of investments.\nWe are highly dependent on information systems and systems failures could significantly disrupt our business, which could, in turn, negatively affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to pay distributions.\nOur business depends on the communications and information systems of GC Advisors and its affiliates. GC Advisors and the Administrator are heavily reliant on the information technology infrastructure, processes and procedures of Golub Capital, which has devoted significant resources to developing effective and reliable information technology systems. Information technology changes rapidly, however, and Golub Capital could fail to stay ahead of such advances. Moreover, Golub Capital could find itself a target of cyberattacks, including cyber espionage, malware, ransomware, and other types of hacking. If any of the Golub Capital information technology systems do not operate properly or are disabled, whether as a result of tampering or a breach of network security systems or otherwise, we and Golub Capital could suffer, among other consequences, financial loss, disruption of businesses and reputational damage and, in the case of Golub Capital, liability to clients. While steps have been taken to mitigate the risk and impact of such attacks, no system is fully attack-proof, and a cyberattack could have an adverse impact on us.\nIn addition, Golub Capitals operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in its computer systems and networks. Although Golub Capital takes protective measures, its computer systems, software and networks could be vulnerable to unauthorized access, theft, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have an impact on security. We, GC Advisors and the Administrator rely on third-party service providers for certain aspects of their business. Any interruption or deterioration in the performance of these third parties or failures of their information systems and technology could impair the quality of the operations and could affect their reputation, which could have an adverse effect on us.\nA data breach could negatively impact our business and result in significant penalties.\nGC Advisors is subject to numerous laws in various jurisdictions relating to privacy and the storage, sharing, use, processing, disclosure and protection of information that we and our affiliates hold. The EUs General Data Protection Regulation, the Cayman Islands Data Protection Law, 2017, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 are recent examples of such laws, and GC Advisors anticipates new privacy and data protection laws will be passed in other jurisdictions in the future. In general, these laws introduce many new obligations on GC Advisors and its affiliates and service providers and create new rights for parties who have given us their personal information, such as investors and others.\nBreach of these laws could result in significant financial penalties for GC Advisors and/or us. As interpretation of these laws evolves and new laws are passed, GC Advisors could be required to make changes to its business practices, which could result in additional risks, costs and liabilities to us and adversely affect investment returns.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nWhile GC Advisors intends to comply with its privacy and data protection obligations under the privacy and data protection laws that are applicable to it, it is possible that GC Advisors will not be able to accurately anticipate the ways in which regulators and courts will apply or interpret these laws. A violation of applicable privacy and data protection law could result in negative publicity and/or subject GC Advisors or us, to significant costs associated with litigation, settlements, regulatory action, judgments, liabilities and/or penalties.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents may adversely affect our business or the business of our portfolio companies.\nThe operations of us, Golub Capital, any third-party service provider to us or Golub Capital and our portfolio companies are susceptible to risks from cybersecurity attacks and incidents due to reliance on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in relevant computer systems and networks. An adverse event that threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of the information resources of us or our portfolio companies, or a cyber incident, may be an intentional attack or an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to the information systems of us, Golub Capital or our portfolio companies for purposes of misappropriating assets, stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. Cyber-attacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber security incidents and cyber-attacks have been occurring globally at a more frequent and severe level and will likely continue to increase in frequency in the future. The result of these incidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, liability for stolen assets or information, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs, litigation and damage to business relationships.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. As our and our portfolio companies reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to information systems of ours, Golub Capital and our portfolio companies. Although Golub Capital takes protective measures, these measures, as well as an increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber incident, do not guarantee that a cyber incident will not occur and/or that the financial results, operations or confidential information of ours or our portfolio companies will not be negatively impacted by any such incident. Cybersecurity risks require continuous and increasing attention and other resources, which attention diverts time and other resources from other activities of ours, Golub Capital and our portfolio companies. There is no assurance that any efforts to mitigate cybersecurity risks undertaken by us, Golub Capital or our portfolio companies will be effective. Network, system, application and data breaches as a result of cybersecurity risks or cyber incidents could result in operational disruptions or information misappropriation that could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and financial condition of us and of our portfolio companies.\nOur business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to stockholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder the execution of our investment strategy or impact our stock price.\nStockholder activism, which could take many forms, including making public demands that we consider certain strategic alternatives, engaging in public campaigns to attempt to influence our corporate governance and/or our management, and commencing proxy contests to attempt to elect the activists representatives or others to our board of directors, or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in the business development company space recently. While we are currently not subject to any stockholder activism, due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we could in the future become the target of stockholder activism. Stockholder activism could result in substantial costs and divert managements and our board of directors attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such stockholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future and adversely affect our relationships with service providers and our portfolio companies. Also, we could be required to incur significant legal and other expenses related to any activist stockholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\nTALE OF CONTENTS Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments\nNone. Item 2. Properties\nProperties\nWe do not own any real estate or other physical properties materially important to our operation. Our headquarters are located at 200 Park Avenue, 25th Floor, New York, NY 10166 and are provided by Golub Capital LLC pursuant to the Administration Agreement. We believe that our office facilities are suitable and adequate to our business. Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe, GC Advisors and Golub Capital LLC could, from time to time, be involved in legal and regulatory proceedings arising out of their respective operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, each of us, GC Advisors and Golub Capital LLC do not believe it is currently subject to any material legal proceedings.

As of November 16, 2022, we had 816 stockholders of record.\nDistributions\nOur distributions, if any, are determined by the board of directors. We elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we must distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes each tax year of an amount at least equal to 90% of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of our net long-term capital losses, or investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. In addition, we are subject to ordinary income and capital gain distribution requirements under U.S. federal excise tax rules for each calendar year. If we do not meet the required distributions we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible federal excise tax on the undistributed amount.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nThe following table reflects the cash distributions, including dividends and returns of capital per share that we have declared on our common stock.\nRecord Dates Payment Date\nDistributions\nDeclared\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2022\nSeptember 2, 2022 September 29, 2022 $ 0.30\nJune 3, 2022 June 29, 2022 0.30\nMarch 4, 2022 March 29, 2022 0.30\nDecember 10, 2021 December 30, 2021 0.30\nTotal $ 1.20\nFiscal year ended September 30, 2021\nSeptember 8, 2021 September 29, 2021 $ 0.29\nJune 11, 2021 June 29, 2021 0.29\nMarch 5, 2021 March 30, 2021 0.29\nDecember 11, 2020 December 30, 2020 0.29\nTotal $ 1.16\nOn November 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per share, which is payable on December 29, 2022 to holders of record as of December 9, 2022.\nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders. As a result, if our board of directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who participate in our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.\nSale of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nNone.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nStock Performance Graph\nThis graph compares the stockholder return on our common stock from September 30, 2016 to September 30, 2022 with that of the NASDAQ Financial 100 Stock Index and the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index. This graph assumes that on September 30, 2016, $100 was invested in our common stock, the NASDAQ Financial 100 Stock Index, and the Standard & Poors 500 Stock Index. The graph also assumes the reinvestment of all cash distributions prior to any tax effect. The graph and other information furnished under this Part II Item 5 of this annual report on Form 10-K shall not be deemed to be soliciting material or to be filed with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under, or to the liabilities of Section 18 of, the Exchange Act. The stock price performance included in the below graph is not necessarily indicative of future stock performance.\nFees and Expenses\nThe following table is being provided to update, as of September 30, 2022, certain information in our registration statement on Form N-2 (File No. 333-265509). The following table is intended to assist you in understanding the costs and expenses that an investor in shares of our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. However, we caution you that some of the percentages indicated in the table below are estimates and may vary. Actual costs and expenses incurred by investors in shares of our common stock may be greater than the percentage estimates in the table below. The following table excludes one-time fees payable to third parties not affiliated with GC Advisors that were incurred in connection with the Debt Securitizations, but includes all of the applicable ongoing fees and expenses of the Debt Securitizations. Whenever reference to fees or expenses paid by us or Golub Capital BDC, or that we will pay fees or expenses, our common stockholders will indirectly bear such fees or expenses.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\nStockholder transaction expenses:\nSales load (as a percentage of offering price) 0 % (1)\nOffering expenses (as a percentage of offering price) 0 % (2)\nDividend reinvestment plan expenses None (3)\nTotal stockholder transaction expenses (as a percentage of offering price) 0 %\nAnnual expenses (as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock):\nManagement fees 2.90 % (4)\nIncentive fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement 0.70 % (5)\nInterest payments on borrowed funds 3.51 % (6)\nOther expenses 0.49 % (7)\nAcquired fund fees and expenses 0 %\nTotal annual expenses 7.60 % (8)\n(1)In the event that the securities to which any applicable prospectus relates are sold to or through underwriters or agents, a corresponding prospectus supplement will disclose the applicable sales load.\n(2)In the event that we conduct an offering of our securities, the related prospectus supplement will disclose the estimated amount of total offering expenses (which may include offering expenses borne by third parties on our behalf), the offering price and the offering expenses borne by us as a percentage of the offering price.\n(3)The expenses associated with the dividend reinvestment plan are included in Other expenses. See Dividend Reinvestment Plan.\n(4)Our management fee is calculated at an annual rate equal to 1.375% and is based on the average adjusted gross assets (including assets purchased with borrowed funds and securitization-related assets, leverage, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit with custodian but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and is payable quarterly in arrears. See Item 1. Business - Management Agreements - Investment Advisory Agreement - Management Fee, as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. The management fee referenced in the table above is annualized and based on actual amounts incurred by us during the year ended September 30, 2022, excluding the one-time waiver recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2022 of $1.9 million. The estimate of our annualized base management fees based on actual expenses for the year ended September 30, 2022 assumes net assets of $2,545 million and leverage of $3,094 million, which reflects our net assets and leverage as of September 30, 2022.\nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2018 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \"collection period\" refers to the period commencing on the third business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the third business day prior to such payment date.\nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the GCIC 2018 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the GCIC 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2018 GCIC Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period generally refers to a quarterly period commencing on the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nThe collateral management fees described above are less than the management fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and are paid directly by the 2018 Issuer and GCIC 2018 Issuer, as applicable, to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. Accordingly, the 1.375% base management fee paid by us to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement on all of our assets, including those indirectly held through each of the 2018 Issuer and the GCIC 2018 Issuer, is reduced, on a dollar for dollar basis, by an amount equal to the 0.25% and 0.35% fees paid to GC Advisors by the 2018 Issuer and GCIC 2018 Issuer, respectively.\nFor purposes of this table, the SEC requires that the Management fees percentage be calculated as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stock, rather than total assets, including assets that have been funded with borrowed monies, because common stockholders bear all of this cost. If the base management fee portion of the Management fees percentage were calculated instead as a percentage of our total assets, our base management fee portion of the Management fees percentage would be approximately 1.30% of total assets.\n(5)The incentive fee referenced in the table above is based on actual amounts of the income component of the incentive fee incurred during the year ended September 30, 2022, and the capital gains component payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement as of September 30, 2022. For the year ended September 30, 2022, there was $17.8 million incurred of the income component of the incentive fee and as of September 30, 2022, there was no capital gains component payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. We have structured the calculation of the incentive fee to include a fee limitation such that no incentive fee will be paid to GC Advisors for any quarter if, after such payment, the cumulative incentive fees paid to GC Advisors since the effective date of our election to become a business development company would be greater than 20.0% of our cumulative pre-incentive fee net income per share. For a more detailed discussion of the calculation of the incentive fee, see Item 1. Business - Management Agreements - Income and Capital Gains Incentive Fee Calculation as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC.\nTALE OF CONTENTS\n(6)Interest payments on borrowed funds is based on our cost of funds on our outstanding indebtedness for the year ended September 30, 2022, which consisted of $692.6 million of indebtedness outstanding under Revolving Credit Facilities, $1,446.9 million of principal outstanding less unamortized premium and / or unaccreted original issue discount on our unsecured notes and $954.2 million of principal outstanding less unaccreted discount recognized on the assumption of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization in the Merger in notes issued through the Debt Securitizations. For the year ended September 30, 2022, the annualized cost of funds for our total debt outstanding, which includes all interest and amortization of debt issuance costs on the Debt Securitizations, was 3.0%. Debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with our Debt Securitizations. These fees also include a structuring and placement fee paid to Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC for its services in connection with the initial structuring of the 2018 Debt Securitization and legal fees, accounting fees, rating agency fees and all other costs associated with the 2018 Debt Securitization and GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization.\n(7)Includes our overhead expenses, including payments under the Administration Agreement based on our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator, and any acquired fund fees and expenses that are not required to be disclosed separately. See Item 1. Business - Management Agreements - Administration Agreement, as well as any amendments reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. Other expenses are estimated based on the annualized amounts incurred for the year ended September 30, 2022.\n(8)Total annual expenses as a percentage of consolidated net assets attributable to common stock are higher than the total annual expenses percentage would be for a company that is not leveraged. We borrow money to leverage our net assets and increase our total assets. The SEC requires that the Total annual expenses percentage be calculated as a percentage of net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period), rather than the total assets, including assets that have been funded with borrowed monies. The reason for presenting expenses as a percentage of net assets attributable to common stockholders is that our common stockholders bear all of our fees and expenses.\nExample\nThe following example demonstrates the projected dollar amount of total cumulative expenses that would be incurred over various periods with respect to a hypothetical investment in our common stock. This example and the expenses in the table above should not be considered a representation of our future expenses, and actual expenses (including the cost of debt, if any, and other expenses) may be greater or less than those shown.\nYou would pay the following expenses on a $1,000 investment 1 year 3 Years 5 years 10 years\nAssuming a 5% annual return (assumes no return from net realized capital gains or net unrealized capital appreciation) $69 $203 $332 $634\nAssuming a 5% annual return (assumes return entirely from realized capital gains and thus subject to the capital gain incentive fee) $79 $230 $373 $694\nThe foregoing table is to assist you in understanding the various costs and expenses that an investor in our common stock will bear directly or indirectly. While the example assumes, as required by the SEC, a 5% annual return, our performance will vary and may result in a return greater or less than 5%. The incentive fee under the Investment Advisory Agreement, which, assuming a 5% annual return, would either not be payable or have an immaterial impact on the expense amounts shown above, is not included in the example. Under our Investment Advisory Agreement, no incentive fee would be payable if we have a 5% annual return. If we achieve sufficient returns on our investments, including through the realization of capital gains, to trigger an incentive fee of a material amount, our expenses, and returns to our investors, would be higher. The example assumes that all dividends and other distributions are reinvested at net asset value. Under certain circumstances, reinvestment of dividends and other distributions under our dividend reinvestment plan may occur at a price per share that differs from net asset value. See Dividend Reinvestment Plan for more information.\nTALE OF CONTENTS Item 6. Reserved Item 7.

This annual report on Form 10-K contains statistics and other data that have been obtained from or compiled from information made available by third-party service providers. We have not independently verified such statistics or data.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a business development company and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nOur shares are currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol GBDC.\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by investing primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest in second lien and subordinated loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in U.S. middle-market companies. We intend to achieve our investment objective by (1) accessing the established loan origination channels developed by Golub Capital, a leading lender to U.S. middle-market companies with over $55 billion in capital under management as of July 1, 2022, (2) selecting investments within our core middle-market company focus, (3) partnering with experienced private equity firms, or sponsors, in many cases with whom Golub Capital has invested alongside in the past, (4) implementing the disciplined underwriting standards of Golub Capital and (5) drawing upon the aggregate experience and resources of Golub Capital.\nOur investment activities are managed by GC Advisors and supervised by our board of directors of which a majority of the members are independent of us, GC Advisors and its affiliates.\nUnder the Investment Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to pay GC Advisors an annual base management fee based on our average adjusted gross assets as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. The Investment Advisory Agreement was most recently approved by our board of directors in May 2022. Under the Administration Agreement, we are provided with certain administrative services by the Administrator, which is currently Golub Capital LLC. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse the Administrator for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by the Administrator in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement.\nWe seek to create a portfolio that includes primarily one stop and other senior secured loans by primarily investing approximately $10.0 million to $75.0 million of capital, on average, in the securities of U.S. middle-market companies. We also selectively invest more than $75.0 million in some of our portfolio companies and generally expect that the size of our individual investments will vary proportionately with the size of our capital base.\nWe generally invest in securities that have been rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. These securities, which are often referred to as junk, have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal. In addition, many of our debt investments have floating interest rates that reset on a periodic basis and typically do not fully pay down principal prior to maturity, which may increase our risk of losing part or all of our investment.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, our portfolio at fair value was comprised of the following:\nAs of September 30, 2022 As of September 30, 2021\nInvestment Type Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments Investments at\nFair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\nSenior secured $ 472,873 8.7 % $ 784,805 16.0 %\nOne stop 4,668,609 85.7 3,882,314 79.3\nSecond lien 23,240 0.4 41,857 0.9\nSubordinated debt 3,815 0.1 172 0.0 *\nEquity 277,819 5.1 185,738 3.8\nTotal $ 5,446,356 100.0 % $ 4,894,886 100.0 %\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nOne stop loans include loans to technology companies undergoing strong growth due to new services, increased adoption and/or entry into new markets. We refer to loans to these companies as recurring revenue loans.1 Other targeted characteristics of recurring revenue businesses include strong customer revenue retention rates, a diversified customer base and backing from growth equity or venture capital firms. In some cases, the borrowers high revenue growth is supported by a high level of discretionary spending. As part of the underwriting of such loans and consistent with industry practice, we adjust our characterization of the earnings of such borrowers for a reduction or elimination of such discretionary expenses, if appropriate. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, one stop loans included $659.1 million and $527.8 million, respectively, of recurring revenue loans at fair value.\n1 As of November 10, 2022, we have updated terminology from late stage lending to recurring revenue to better reflect the commercial activity of our business.\nEquity investments include investments in preferred equity of portfolio companies structured to have all or a majority of their expected return from contractual rates of return payable based on the original investment. We refer to these investments as yield oriented preferred equity investments. As of September 30, 2022, we had yield oriented preferred equity investments with a total cost basis of $142.5 million with a weighted average contractual rate of approximately 11%, or the Yield Oriented Preferred Return. The Yield Oriented Preferred Return is included in net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had debt and equity investments in 331 and 296 portfolio companies, respectively.\nThe following table shows the weighted average income yield and weighted average investment income yield of our earning portfolio company investments, which represented nearly 100% of our debt investments, as well as the total return based on our average net asset value, and the total return based on the change in the quoted market price of our stock and assuming distributions were reinvested in accordance with our dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, in each case for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nWeighted average income yield (1)(2)\n7.4% 7.4%\nWeighted average investment income yield (3)\n8.0% 7.9%\nTotal return based on average net asset value (4)\n5.9% 13.7%\nTotal return based on market value (5)\n(14.8)% 28.9%\n(1)Represents income from interest and fees, excluding amortization of capitalized fees, discounts and purchase premium (as described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements), divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio company investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(2)The income yield presented for the year ended September 30, 2022 excludes the one-time recognition of $2.0 million of previously deferred interest income resulting from the repayment and refinancing of former non-accrual loans, which are included in the calculation of the investment income yield for the year ended September 30, 2022. The income yield was 7.5% for the year ended September 30, 2022 when including the $2.0 million of interest income\n(3)Represents income from interest, fees and amortization of capitalized fees and discounts, excluding amortization of purchase premium (as described in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements), divided by the average fair value of earning portfolio investments, and does not represent a return to any investor in us.\n(4)Total return based on average net asset value is calculated as (a) the net increase/(decrease) in net assets resulting from operations divided by (b) the daily average of total net assets. Total return does not include sales load.\n(5)Total return based on market value assumes distributions are reinvested in accordance with the DRIP. Total return does not include sales load.\nRevenues: We generate revenue in the form of interest and fee income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on portfolio company investments that we originate or acquire. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, one stop, second lien or subordinated loans, typically have a term of three to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. In some\ncases, our investments provide for deferred interest payments or PIK interest. The principal amount of loans and any accrued but unpaid interest generally become due at the maturity date.\nIn addition, we generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. For additional details on revenues, see Critical Accounting Policies-Revenue Recognition. We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment or derivative instrument, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and derivative instruments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nExpenses: Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to GC Advisors under the Investment Advisory Agreement and interest expense on our outstanding debt. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\ncalculating our NAV (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\nfees and expenses incurred by GC Advisors payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments, which fees and expenses include, among other items, due diligence reports, appraisal reports, any studies commissioned by GC Advisors and travel and lodging expenses;\nexpenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\nofferings of our common stock and other securities;\nadministration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the Administration Agreement (including payments based upon our allocable portion of the Administrators overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs);\nfees payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments in portfolio companies, including costs associated with meeting financial sponsors;\ntransfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\nU.S. federal and state registration and franchise fees;\nall costs of registration and listing our shares on any securities exchange;\nU.S. federal, state and local taxes;\nindependent directors fees and expenses;\ncosts of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\ncosts of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\ncosts associated with individual or group stockholders;\ncosts associated with compliance under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\nour allocable portion of any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\ndirect costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\nproxy voting expenses; and\nall other expenses incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business.\nWe expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.\nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for the 2018 Issuer under a collateral management agreement, or the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.25% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, the term \"collection period\" refers to the period commencing on the third business day prior to the preceding payment date and ending on (but excluding) the third business day prior to such payment date.\nGC Advisors, as collateral manager for Golub Capital Investment Corporation CLO II LLC, or the GCIC 2018 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, is entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the GCIC 2018 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2018 GCIC Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period generally refers to a quarterly period commencing on the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nPrior to the redemption of the 2020 Notes and the termination of the documents governing the 2020 Debt Securitization on August 26, 2021, GC Advisors served as collateral manager for Golub Capital BDC CLO 4 LLC, or the 2020 Issuer, under a collateral management agreement, or the 2020 Collateral Management Agreement, and was entitled to receive an annual fee in an amount equal to 0.35% of the principal balance of the portfolio loans held by the 2020 Issuer at the beginning of the collection period relating to each payment date, which is payable in arrears on each payment date. Under the 2020 Collateral Management Agreement, the term collection period generally referred to a quarterly period commencing on the day after the end of the prior collection period to the tenth business day prior to the payment date.\nCollateral management fees were paid directly by the 2020 Issuer and are paid directly by the 2018 Issuer and GCIC 2018 Issuer to GC Advisors and are offset against the management fees payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The 2018 Issuer paid Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2018 Debt Securitization. Before we acquired the GCIC 2018 Issuer as part of our acquisition of GCIC (as defined in the GCIC Acquisition section below), the GCIC 2018 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the initial structuring of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization. The 2020 Issuer paid Wells Fargo Securities, LLC structuring and placement fees for its services in connection with the structuring of the 2020 Debt Securitization. Term debt securitizations are also known as CLOs, and are a form of secured financing incurred by us, which are consolidated by us and subject to our overall asset coverage requirement. The 2018 Issuer and GCIC 2018 Issuer also agreed to pay ongoing administrative expenses to the trustee, collateral manager, independent accountants, legal counsel, rating agencies and independent managers in connection with developing and maintaining reports, and providing required services in connection with the administration of the 2018 Debt Securitization and GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization and collectively the Debt Securitizations, as applicable.\nWe believe that these administrative expenses approximate the amount of ongoing fees and expenses that we would be required to pay in connection with a traditional secured credit facility. Our common stockholders indirectly bear all of these expenses.\nGCIC Acquisition\nOn September 16, 2019, we completed our acquisition of GCIC pursuant to the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding share of GCICs common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.865 shares of our common stock (with GCICs stockholders receiving cash in lieu of fractional shares of our common stock). As a result of the Merger, we issued an aggregate of 71,779,964 shares of our common stock to former stockholders of GCIC.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe spread of COVID-19, which was identified as a global pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020, resulted in governmental authorities imposing restrictions on travel and the temporary closure of many corporate offices, retail stores, restaurants, healthcare facilities, fitness clubs and manufacturing facilities and factories in affected jurisdictions. While restrictions, business closures and other quarantine measures have been lifted in certain states in the United States and other countries, COVID-19 outbreaks have led and could lead to the re-introduction of such restrictions. As a result, we are unable to predict the duration of business and supply chain disruptions, the\nextent to which COVID-19 will continue to affect our portfolio companies operating results or the impact COVID-19 may have on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and GC Advisors continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and guidance from U.S. and international authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities, and future recommendations from such authorities may further impact our business operations and financial results. Due to certain resurgences of COVID-19 and the threat of new variants of COVID-19, we remain cautious and concerned about the on-going impacts to the U.S. economy from COVID-19.\nLIBOR Transition\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, announced its intention to cease sustaining the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, by the end of 2021.\nAs of January 1, 2022, USD LIBOR is available in five settings (overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month). The IBA has stated that it will cease to publish all remaining USD LIBOR settings immediately following their publication on June 30, 2023. As of January 1, 2022, all non-USD LIBOR reference rates in all settings ceased to be published.\nIn April 2018, the New York Federal Reserve Bank began publishing its alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR. The Bank of England followed suit in April 2018 by publishing its proposed alternative rate, the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA.\nEach of SOFR and SONIA significantly differ from LIBOR, both in the actual rate and how it is calculated, and therefore it is unclear whether and when markets will adopt either of these rates as a widely accepted replacement for LIBOR.\nAs such, when LIBOR is discontinued, if a replacement rate is not widely agreed upon or if a replacement rate is significantly different from LIBOR, it could cause a disruption in the credit markets generally. Such a disruption could also negatively impact the market value and/or transferability of our portfolio company investments. Furthermore, disruptions related to loans and/or other debt financing securitizations (CLOs) in the marketplace could have a material adverse effect on the ability of GC Advisors or its affiliates to enter into loans in the future in accordance with our investment strategy and have a material adverse effect on us. We could also be materially and adversely impacted to the extent GC Advisors or its affiliates are unable to successfully implement an acceptable replacement rate in leverage utilized by us or if there is a prolonged period of mismatch on the interest rates payable on our leverage and our portfolio investments as a result of the discontinued publication of LIBOR results in a decrease in our net investment income and distributions we are able to pay to our stockholders.\nIn anticipation of the discontinuation of LIBOR, we have assessed our current debt facilities for our exposure to LIBOR. Effective September 2, 2022, the JPM Credit Facility was amended to replace LIBOR with SOFR as an interest rate benchmark. The notes offered in the 2018 Debt Securitization and GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization currently utilize a reference rate to three-month USD LIBOR. We may seek to amend or refinance the Debt Securitizations prior to June 30, 2023, the cessation date for three-month USD LIBOR. The 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes accrue fixed-rate interest and will not be affected by any discontinuation of LIBOR. We expect any new debt facilities will reference a benchmark interest rate other than LIBOR, such as SOFR.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 18, 2022, our board of directors declared a quarterly distribution of $0.33 per share, which is payable on December 29, 2022 to holders of record as of December 9, 2022.\nOn November 18, 2022, our board of directors approved amended and restated bylaws that revise Section 2.8 of the bylaws regarding the preparation of voting lists in advance of stockholder meetings to conform to recent amendments to the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding preparation of such lists.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe comparison of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 can be found in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 located within Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nConsolidated operating results for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nYear ended Variances\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 2022 vs. 2021\n(In thousands)\nInterest income $ 373,829 $ 309,832 $ 63,997\nAccretion of discounts and amortization of premiums 24,679 21,399 3,280\nGCIC acquisition purchase premium amortization (15,632) (30,793) 15,161\nDividend income 684 1,713 (1,029)\nFee income 4,242 4,974 (732)\nTotal investment income 387,802 307,125 80,677\nTotal net expenses 191,611 139,453 52,158\nNet investment income before taxes 196,191 167,672 28,519\nIncome tax 72 - 72\nNet investment income after taxes 196,119 167,672 28,447\nNet realized gain (loss) on investment transactions excluding purchase premium 20,642 8,297 12,345\nNet realized gain (loss) on investment transactions due to purchase premium (266) (392) 126\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions excluding purchase premium (77,796) 134,061 (211,857)\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions due to purchase premium 15,898 31,185 (15,287)\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions (41,522) 173,151 (214,673)\n(Provision) benefit for taxes on realized gain on investments (302) - (302)\n(Provision) benefit for taxes on unrealized appreciation on investments (855) (543) (312)\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations $ 153,440 $ 340,280 $ (186,840)\nAverage earning debt investments, at fair value $ 5,061,410 $ 4,236,042 $ 825,368\nNet income can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation. As a result, quarterly and year-to-date comparisons of net income may not be meaningful.\nOn September 16, 2019, we completed our acquisition of GCIC. The acquisition was accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805-50, Business Combinations - Related Issues. Under asset acquisition accounting, where the consideration paid to GCICs stockholders exceeded the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the premium paid by us was allocated to the cost of the GCIC assets acquired by us pro-rata based on their relative fair value. Immediately following the acquisition of GCIC, we recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the GCIC assets acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on our Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on such loans acquired through their ultimate disposition. The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity securities acquired from GCIC and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, we will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the equity securities acquired.\nAs a supplement to our GAAP financial measures, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful for the reasons described below:\nAdjusted Net Investment Income - excludes the amortization of the purchase price premium from net investment income calculated in accordance with GAAP;\nAdjusted Net Investment Income Before Accrual for Capital Gain Incentive Fee - Adjusted Net Investment Income excluding the accrual or reversal for the capital gain incentive fee under GAAP;\nAdjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) - excludes the unrealized loss resulting from the purchase premium write-down and the corresponding reversal of the unrealized loss resulting from the amortization of the premium on loans or from the sale of equity investments from the determination of realized and unrealized gain/(loss) determined in accordance with GAAP; and\nAdjusted Net Income - calculates net income and earnings per share based on Adjusted Net Investment Income and Adjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss).\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet investment income after taxes $ 196,119 $ 167,672\nAdd: GCIC acquisition purchase premium amortization 15,632 30,793\nAdjusted Net Investment Income $ 211,751 $ 198,465\nNet gain (loss) on investment transactions $ (41,522) $ 173,151\nAdd: Realized loss on investment transactions due to purchase premium 266 392\nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation on investment transactions due to purchase premium (15,898) (31,185)\nAdjusted Net Realized and Unrealized Gain/(Loss) $ (57,154) $ 142,358\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations $ 153,440 $ 340,280\nAdd: GCIC acquisition purchase premium amortization 15,632 30,793\nAdd: Realized loss on investment transactions due to purchase premium 266 392\nLess: Net change in unrealized appreciation on investment transactions due to purchase premium (15,898) (31,185)\nAdjusted Net Income $ 153,440 $ 340,280\nWe believe that excluding the financial impact of the purchase premium in the above non-GAAP financial measures is useful for investors as this is a non-cash expense/loss and is one method we use to measure our results of operations. In addition, we believe that providing the Adjusted Net Investment Income Before Accrual for Capital Gain Incentive Fee is a useful non-GAAP financial measure as such accrual is not contractually payable under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nAlthough these non-GAAP financial measures are intended to enhance investors understanding of our business and performance, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered an alternative to GAAP.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income increased from the year ended September 30, 2021 to the year ended September 30, 2022 by $80.7 million primarily due to an increase in the average earning debt investments balance of $825.4 million and a decrease of the GCIC acquisition purchase price premium amortization.\nThe annualized income yield by debt security type for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nSenior secured 6.4% 6.1%\nOne stop 7.5% 7.7%\nSecond lien 9.0% 11.5%\nSubordinated debt 12.1% 12.0%\nIncome yields on senior secured loans increased for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to rising LIBOR and SOFR rates during the second half of the 2022 fiscal year. Income yields on one stop loans decreased for the year ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the year ended September 30, 2021, primarily due to lower fee income and the general trend of interest rate compression on new investments during the first three quarters of the 2022 fiscal year. Our loan portfolio is partially insulated from a drop in floating interest rates, as over 98.0% of the loan portfolio at fair value is subject to an interest rate floor. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the weighted average base rate floor of our loans was 0.83% and 0.90%, respectively. The decrease in our portfolios weighted average base rate floor is primarily due to the majority of our new portfolio company investments originating with base rate floors ranging between 0.00% and 0.75%.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we have second lien investments in three portfolio companies and subordinated debt investments in two portfolio companies as shown in the Consolidated Schedule of Investments. Due to the limited number of second lien and subordinated debt investments, income yields on second lien and subordinated debt investments can be significantly impacted by the addition, subtraction or refinancing of one investment.\nFor additional details on investment yields and asset mix, refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Portfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield section below.\nExpenses\nThe following table summarizes our expenses for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended Variances\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 2022 vs. 2021\n(In thousands)\nInterest and other debt financing expenses $ 82,041 $ 55,536 $ 26,505\nAmortization of debt issuance costs 7,337 10,203 (2,866)\nBase management fee, net of waiver 71,962 57,858 14,104\nIncome incentive fee 17,756 3,214 14,542\nCapital gain incentive fee - - -\nProfessional fees 3,607 3,992 (385)\nAdministrative service fee 7,188 7,227 (39)\nGeneral and administrative expenses 1,720 1,423 297\nNet expenses $ 191,611 $ 139,453 $ 52,158\nAverage debt outstanding $ 2,935,846 $ 2,184,010 $ 751,836\nInterest Expense\nInterest and other debt financing expenses, including amortization of debt issuance costs, increased from the year ended September 30, 2021 to the year ended September 30, 2022 by $23.6 million, primarily due to an increase in average debt outstanding of $751.8 million as well as rising LIBOR and SOFR rates on borrowings from our floating rate debt facilities. For more information about our outstanding borrowings for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, including the terms thereof, see Note 7. Borrowings in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the effective average interest rate, which includes amortization of debt financing costs, amortization of discounts on notes issued and non-usage facility fees, on our total debt was 3.0% and 3.0%, respectively.\nThe effective annualized average interest rate stayed consistent for the year ended September 30, 2022 compared to the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to the issuance of the additional 2026 Notes and the additional 2024 Notes in October 2021 at a price resulting in a yield to maturity of 2.667% and 1.809%, respectively, that was offset by rising interest rates on our borrowings from floating rate debt facilities.\nManagement Fee\nThe base management fee, net of waiver, increased from the year ended September 30, 2021 to the year ended September 30, 2022 due to an increase in average adjusted gross assets from 2021 to 2022, partially offset by the management fee waiver described below.\nEffective April 1, 2022, GC Advisors changed its practice of retaining administrative agent fees earned in respect of co-investment transactions in which we participate. In connection with this change, for the three months ended March 31, 2022, GC Advisors voluntarily and irrevocably waived $1.9 million* of base management fees related to certain administrative agent fees received by GC Advisors prior to this change. The waiver had the net economic effect of providing us an amount equal to our pro rata portion of administrative agent fees earned by GC Advisors from our borrowers.\nIncentive Fees\nThe incentive fee payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement consists of two parts: (1) the Income Incentive Fee and (2) the Capital Gain Incentive Fee. The Income Incentive Fee increased by $14.5 million from the year ended September 30, 2021 to the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily as a result of an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and a greater rate of return on the value of our net assets driven by net funds growth and the impact of rising LIBOR and SOFR rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022. As we remained in the catch-up provision of the calculation of the Income Incentive Fee for the year ended September 30, 2021 and for the first three quarters of the year ended September 30, 2022, an increase in Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income caused a corresponding increase in the Income Incentive fee. During the quarter ended September 30, 2022, we were fully through the catch up and the Income Incentive Fee was equal to 20% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income.\nThe Income Incentive Fee as a percentage of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was 8.3% and 1.9% for the year ended September 30, 2022 and the year ended September 30, 2021, respectively.\nAs of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement. In accordance with GAAP, we are required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there was no capital gain incentive fee accrual calculated in accordance with GAAP. Any payment due under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year. No Capital Gain Incentive Fees as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement or any prior investment advisory agreements, as applicable, have been payable since December 31, 2018.\nFor additional details on unrealized appreciation and depreciation of investments, refer to the Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses section below.\nProfessional Fees, Administrative Service Fee, and General and Administrative Expenses\nIn total, professional fees, the administrative service fee, and general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million from the year ended September 30, 2021 to the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily due to a decrease in professional fees. In general, we expect certain of our operating expenses, including professional fees, the administrative service fee, and other general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of our total assets during periods of growth and increase as a percentage of our total assets during periods of asset declines.\nThe Administrator pays for certain expenses incurred by us. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash.\nTotal expenses reimbursed to the Administrator during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 were $6.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, included in accounts payable and other liabilities were $2.0 million and $2.5 million, respectively, of expenses paid on behalf of us by the Administrator.\n*The net economic effect represents $6.5 million of GBDCs pro rata portion of administrative agent fees retained by GC Advisors since the exemptive relief issued to GBDC and its affiliates on February 27, 2017, reduced by $4.6 million of the additional incentive fees GC Advisors would have earned on the pro rata portion of administrative agent fees.\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses\nThe following table summarizes our net realized and unrealized gains (losses) for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended Variances\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 2022 vs. 2021\n(In thousands)\nNet realized gain (loss) on investments $ 19,549 $ 13,324 $ 6,225\nForeign currency transactions (253) (5,419) 5,166\nForward currency contracts 1,080 - 1,080\nNet realized gain (loss) on investment transactions $ 20,376 $ 7,905 $ 12,471\nUnrealized appreciation on investments 53,327 183,514 (130,187)\nUnrealized (depreciation) on investments (110,133) (23,339) (86,794)\nUnrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies (37,335) 3,917 (41,252)\nUnrealized appreciation (depreciation) on forward currency contracts 32,243 1,154 31,089\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions $ (61,898) $ 165,246 $ (227,144)\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2022, we had a net realized gain of $20.4 million primarily attributable to recognized realized gains on the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies and the gain on the settlement of a forward currency contract, partially offset by recognized realized losses on the restructure, sale, or write-off on multiple portfolio companies and net realized losses recognized due to the repayment of non-U.S. dollar dominated debt.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, we had a net realized gain of $7.9 million, primarily attributable to net realized gains from the sale of equity investments in multiple portfolio companies, that was partially offset by recognized realized losses on the restructure, sale, or write-off on multiple portfolio companies and net realized losses recognized due to the repayment of non-U.S. dollar dominated debt.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had $53.3 million in unrealized appreciation on 159 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $110.1 million in unrealized depreciation on 234 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from better than expected performance of our portfolio companies. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2022 primarily resulted from decreases in the fair value in the majority of our portfolio company investments due to wider credit spreads in the market during the last two quarters of the 2022 fiscal year and the reversal of unrealized appreciation recognized in connection with realized gains on the sale of portfolio company investments. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we had net unrealized depreciation of $37.3 million on the translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies that were partially offset by $32.2 million of unrealized appreciation on forward currency contracts, which resulted from the U.S. dollar appreciation primarily compared to the U.K. pound sterling and Euro.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we had $183.5 million in unrealized appreciation on 272 portfolio company investments, which was offset by $23.3 million in unrealized depreciation on 79 portfolio company investments. Unrealized appreciation for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily resulted from better than expected performance of our portfolio companies and continued reversal of depreciation recognized due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unrealized depreciation for the year ended September 30, 2021 primarily resulted from the amortization of discounts, negative credit related adjustments that caused a reduction in fair value and the reversal of the net unrealized appreciation associated with the sale of portfolio company investments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we experienced a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of $63.3 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $416.5 million, primarily driven by fundings of portfolio investments of $1.88 billion, offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $1.26 billion and net investment income of $196.1 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $353.1 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $1.29 billion, offset by repayments of debt of $741.2 million and distributions paid of $155.2 million and purchases of common stock under the DRIP of $36.4 million.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we experienced a net increase in cash, cash equivalents, foreign currencies, restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies of $60.8 million. During the period, cash used in operating activities was $306.0 million, primarily driven by fundings of portfolio investments of $2.08 billion, offset by proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments of $1.59 billion and net investment income of $167.7 million. Lastly, cash provided by financing activities was $366.9 million, primarily driven by borrowings on debt of $3.36 billion, offset by repayments of debt of $2.82 billion, distributions paid of $139.1 million, and purchases of common stock under the DRIP of $14.7 million.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $117.3 million and $175.6 million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign currencies of $6.8 million and $5.5 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, restricted cash and cash equivalents of $56.4 million and $61.8 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, and restricted foreign currencies of $0.0 million and $1.4 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies are available to fund new investments, pay operating expenses and pay distributions. Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies can be used to pay principal and interest on borrowings and to fund new investments that meet the guidelines under our debt securitizations or credit facilities, as applicable.\nRevolving Debt Facilities\nJPM Credit Facility - On February 11, 2021, we entered into the JPM Credit Facility, which, as of September 30, 2022, allowed us to borrow up to $1.24 billion at any one time outstanding, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had outstanding debt under the JPM Credit Facility of $692.6 million and $472.1 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, subject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, we had $544.9 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of remaining commitments and $544.9 million and $2.9 million of availability, respectively, on the JPM Credit Facility.\nAdviser Revolver - On June 22, 2016, we entered into the Adviser Revolver, which, as amended, permitted us to borrow up to $100.0 million at any one time outstanding as of September 30, 2022. We entered into the Adviser Revolver in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis and have in the past repaid, and generally intend in the future to repay, borrowings under the Adviser Revolver within 30 to 45 days from which they are drawn. As of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had no amounts outstanding on the Adviser Revolver.\nDebt Securitizations\n2018 Debt Securitization - On November 16, 2018, we completed the 2018 Debt Securitization. The Class A, Class B and Class C-1 2018 Notes are included in the September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt, and the Class C-2, Class D and Subordinated 2018 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had outstanding debt under the 2018 Debt Securitization of $408.2 million.\nGCIC 2018 Debt Securitization - Effective September 16, 2019, we assumed as a result of the Merger, the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization. The Class A-1, Class A-2 (Class A-2-R GCIC 2018 Notes after refinancing on December 21, 2020) and Class B-1 GCIC 2018 Notes are included in the September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as our debt, and the Class B-2, Class C and Class D GCIC 2018 Notes and the Subordinated GCIC 2018 Notes were eliminated in consolidation. As of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had outstanding debt under the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization of $546.0 million.\nDue to the interplay of the 1940 Act restrictions on principal and joint transactions and the U.S. risk retention rules adopted pursuant to Section 941 of Dodd-Frank, as a business development company, we sought and received no action relief from the SEC to ensure we could engage in CLO financings in which assets are transferred through GC Advisors.\n2024 Notes\nOn October 2, 2020, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes. On October 15, 2021, we issued an additional $100.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2024 Notes. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had $500.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively, of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes, respectively.\n2026 Notes\nOn February 24, 2021, we issued $400.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes. On October 13, 2021, we issued an additional $200.0 million in aggregate principal of the 2026 Notes. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had $600.0 million and $400.0 million, respectively, of outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes, respectively.\n2027 Notes\nOn July 27, 2021, we issued $350.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Notes, all of which remained outstanding as our debt as of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nEquity Distribution Agreement\nOn May 28, 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement, or the Equity Distribution Agreement, in connection with the launch of an at the market program to sell up to $250.0 million of shares of our common stock. An at the market offering is a registered offering by a publicly traded issuer of its listed equity securities that allows the issuer to sell shares directly into the market at market prices. As of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there have been no common stock issuances under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nAsset Coverage, Contractual Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Liquidity Considerations\nAs of September 30, 2022, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least 150% after such borrowing. Prior to February 6, 2019, in accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least 200% after such borrowing. We currently intend to continue to target a GAAP debt-to-equity ratio between 0.85x to 1.25x. As of September 30, 2022, our asset coverage for borrowed amounts and GAAP debt-to-equity ratio was 181.7% and 1.22x, respectively.\nIn August 2022, our board of directors reapproved a share repurchase program, or the Program, which allows us to repurchase up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the NAV per share as reported in our then most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Program is implemented at the discretion of management with shares to be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. We did not make any repurchases of our common stock during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $224.6 million and $340.7 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, total commitments of $224.6 million included $35.6 million of unfunded commitments on revolvers. There is no guarantee that these amounts will be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers, subject to the terms of each loans respective credit agreement. A summary of maturity requirements for our principal borrowings as of September 30, 2022 is included in Note 7 of our consolidated financial statements. We did not have any other material contractual payment obligations as of September 30, 2022. As of September 30, 2022, we believe that we had sufficient assets and liquidity to adequately cover future obligations under our unfunded commitments based on historical rates of\ndrawings upon unfunded commitments, cash and restricted cash balances that we maintain, availability under the Adviser Revolver and JPM Credit Facility, as well as ongoing principal repayments on debt investments. In addition, we generally hold some syndicated loans in larger portfolio companies that are saleable over a relatively short period to generate cash.\nIn addition, we have entered and, in the future, may again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for outstanding forward currency contracts as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against us, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and may realize a loss. We minimize market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future securities offerings and future borrowings, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, we cannot assure you that our efforts to raise capital will be successful. In addition, from time to time, we can amend or refinance our leverage facilities and securitization financings, to the extent permitted by applicable law. In addition to capital not being available, it also may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent we are not able to raise capital on what we believe are favorable terms, we will focus on optimizing returns by investing capital generated from repayments into new investments we believe are attractive from a risk/reward perspective. Furthermore, to the extent we are not able to raise capital and are at or near our targeted leverage ratios, we expect to receive smaller allocations, if any, on new investment opportunities under GC Advisors allocation policy and have, in the past, received such smaller allocations under similar circumstances.\nPortfolio Composition, Investment Activity and Yield\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, we had investments in 331 and 296 portfolio companies, respectively, with a total fair value of $5.4 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively.\nThe following table shows the asset mix of our new investment commitments for the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\n(In thousands) Percentage (In thousands) Percentage\nSenior secured $ 64,645 3.6 % $ 398,734 17.0 %\nOne stop 1,642,741 90.4 1,850,769 78.8\nSecond lien 640 0.0 * 29,899 1.3\nSubordinated debt 988 0.0 * 377 0.0 *\nEquity 108,200 6.0 67,901 2.9\nTotal new investment commitments $ 1,817,214 100.0 % $ 2,347,680 100.0 %\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2022, we had approximately $1,260.8 million in proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments.\nFor the year ended September 30, 2021, we had approximately $1,593.5 million in proceeds from principal payments and sales of portfolio investments.\nThe following table shows the principal, amortized cost and fair value of our portfolio of investments by asset class:\nAs of September 30, 2022(1)\nAs of September 30, 2021(2)\nPrincipal Amortized\nCost Fair\nValue Principal Amortized\nCost Fair\nValue\n(In thousands) (In thousands)\nSenior secured:\nPerforming $ 479,354 $ 496,870 $ 461,935 $ 796,269 $ 793,707 $ 781,962\nNon-accrual(3)\n39,834 21,346 10,938 20,047 9,813 2,843\nOne stop:\nPerforming 4,706,125 4,710,508 4,614,422 3,876,907 3,860,525 3,839,053\nNon-accrual(3)\n95,475 75,610 54,187 59,699 52,806 43,261\nSecond lien:\nPerforming 25,801 29,337 23,240 42,571 41,946 41,857\nNon-accrual(3)\n- - - - - -\nSubordinated debt:\nPerforming 3,869 3,814 3,815 172 171 172\nNon-accrual(3)\n- - - - - -\nEquity N/A 232,119 277,819 N/A 136,429 185,738\nTotal $ 5,350,458 $ 5,569,604 $ 5,446,356 $ 4,795,665 $ 4,895,397 $ 4,894,886\n(1)As of September 30, 2022, $587.7 million and $533.0 million of our loans at amortized cost and fair value, respectively, included a feature permitting a portion of the interest due on such loan to be PIK interest.\n(2)As of September 30, 2021, $502.1 million and $476.1 million of our loans at amortized cost and fair value, respectively, included a feature permitting a portion of the interest due on such loan to be PIK interest.\n(3)We refer to a loan as non-accrual when we cease recognizing interest income on the loan because we have stopped pursuing repayment of the loan or, in certain circumstances, it is past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or our management has reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected. See - Critical Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition.\nAs of September 30, 2022, we had loans in eight portfolio companies on non-accrual status, and non-accrual\ninvestments as a percentage of total debt investments at cost and fair value were 1.8% and 1.3%, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, we had loans in six portfolio companies on non-accrual status, and non-accrual investments as a percentage of total investments at cost and fair value were 1.3% and 1.0%, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the fair value of our debt investments as a percentage of the outstanding principal value was 96.6% and 98.2%, respectively.\nThe following table shows the weighted average rate, spread over the applicable base rate of floating rate and fees of investments originated and the weighted average rate of sales and payoffs of portfolio companies during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021:\nYear ended\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nWeighted average rate of new investment fundings 7.1% 6.7%\nWeighted average spread over the applicable base rate of new floating rate investment fundings 5.9% 5.8%\nWeighted average fees of new investment fundings 1.2% 1.2%\nWeighted average rate of sales and payoffs of portfolio investments 6.6% 6.9%\nAs of September 30, 2022, 97.9% and 98.1% of our debt portfolio at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans. As of September 30, 2021, 92.4% and 92.4% of our debt portfolio at amortized cost and at fair value, respectively, had interest rate floors that limit the minimum applicable interest rates on such loans.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the portfolio median earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, for our portfolio companies was $51.6 million and $41.1 million, respectively. The portfolio median EBITDA is based on the most recently reported trailing twelve-month EBITDA received from the portfolio company.\nAs part of the monitoring process, GC Advisors regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and rates each of them based on an internal system developed by Golub Capital and its affiliates. This system is not generally accepted in our industry or used by our competitors. It is based on the following categories, which we refer to as GC Advisors internal performance ratings:\nInternal Performance Ratings\nRating Definition\n5 Involves the least amount of risk in our portfolio. The borrower is performing above expectations, and the trends and risk factors are generally favorable.\n4 Involves an acceptable level of risk that is similar to the risk at the time of origination. The borrower is generally performing as expected, and the risk factors are neutral to favorable.\n3 Involves a borrower performing below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased somewhat since origination. The borrower could be out of compliance with debt covenants; however, loan payments are generally not past due.\n2 Involves a borrower performing materially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has increased materially since origination. In addition to the borrower being generally out of compliance with debt covenants, loan payments could be past due (but generally not more than 180 days past due).\n1 Involves a borrower performing substantially below expectations and indicates that the loans risk has substantially increased since origination. Most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Loans rated 1 are not anticipated to be repaid in full and we will reduce the fair market value of the loan to the amount we anticipate will be recovered.\nOur internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.\nFor any investment rated 1, 2 or 3, GC Advisors will increase its monitoring intensity and prepare regular updates for the investment committee, summarizing current operating results and material impending events and suggesting recommended actions.\nGC Advisors monitors and, when appropriate, changes the internal performance ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, GC Advisors and our board of directors review these internal performance ratings on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 5 internal performance rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021:\nAs of September 30, 2022 As of September 30, 2021\nInternal\nPerformance\nRating Investments\nat Fair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments Investments\nat Fair Value\n(In thousands) Percentage of\nTotal\nInvestments\n5 $ 252,572 4.6% $ 499,241 10.2%\n4 4,725,988 86.8 3,951,870 80.7\n3 398,625 7.3 395,208 8.1\n2 69,171 1.3 47,836 1.0\n1 - - 731 0.0*\nTotal $ 5,446,356 100.0% $ 4,894,886 100.0%\n* Represents an amount less than 0.1%.\nDistributions\nWe intend to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders as determined by our board of directors. For additional details on distributions, see Income taxes in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of our distributions from time to time. In addition, the asset coverage requirements applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act could limit our ability to make distributions. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences, including the possible loss of our ability to be subject to tax as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations can differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences are permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future.\nTo the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for any tax year, a portion of those distributions could be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders could be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should read any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains.\nWe have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, our stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our dividend reinvestment plan. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes in the same manner as cash distributions, stockholders participating in our dividend reinvestment plan will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nWe entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with GC Advisors. Mr. Lawrence Golub, our chairman, is a manager of GC Advisors, and Mr. David Golub, our chief executive officer, is a manager of GC Advisors, and each of Messrs. Lawrence Golub and David Golub owns an indirect pecuniary interest in GC Advisors.\nGolub Capital LLC provides, and other affiliates of Golub Capital have historically provided, us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement.\nWe have entered into a license agreement with Golub Capital LLC, pursuant to which Golub Capital LLC has granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Golub Capital.\nUnder the Staffing Agreement, Golub Capital LLC has agreed to provide GC Advisors with the resources necessary to fulfill its obligations under the Investment Advisory Agreement. The Staffing Agreement provides that Golub Capital LLC will make available to GC Advisors experienced investment professionals and provide access to the senior investment personnel of Golub Capital LLC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of GC Advisors investment committee will serve in such capacity. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided on a direct cost reimbursement basis. We are not a party to the Staffing Agreement.\nGC Advisors served as collateral manager to the 2020 Issuer under the 2020 Collateral Management Agreement and serves as collateral manager to the 2018 Issuer and the GCIC 2018 Issuer under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement and the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement, respectively. Fees payable to GC Advisors for providing these services offset against the base management fee payable by us under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nWe have entered into the Adviser Revolver with GC Advisors in order to have the ability to borrow funds on a short-term basis.\nDuring the third calendar quarter of 2022, the Golub Capital Employee Grant Program Rabbi Trust, or the Trust, purchased approximately $17.2 million, or 1,271,865 shares of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. Through the first three calendar quarters of 2022, the Trust purchased approximately $40.4 million, or 2,898,170 shares of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital. During calendar year 2021, the Trust purchased approximately $14.3 million, or 925,040 shares of our common stock, for the purpose of awarding incentive compensation to employees of Golub Capital.\nOn October 2, 2020, an affiliate of GC Advisors purchased $40.0 million of the 2024 Unsecured Notes. On October 8, 2020, the affiliate sold $15.0 million of the 2024 Unsecured Notes to an unaffiliated party. On May 21, 2021, the affiliate sold $25.0 million of the 2024 Unsecured Notes to an unaffiliated party which closed its position.\nGC Advisors also sponsors or manages, and expects in the future to sponsor or manage, other investment funds, accounts or investment vehicles (together referred to as accounts) that have investment mandates that are similar, in whole and in part, with ours. For example, GC Advisors presently serves as the investment adviser to GBDC 3, GDLC, GDLCU and GBDC 4, all of which are unlisted business development companies that primarily focus on investing in one stop and other senior secured loans. In addition, our officers and directors serve in similar capacity for GBDC 3, GDLC, GDLCU and GBDC 4. If GC Advisors and its affiliates determine that an investment is appropriate for us, GBDC 3, GDLC, GDLCU and GBDC 4, and other accounts, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, and pursuant to GC Advisors allocation policy, GC Advisors or its affiliates could determine that we should invest side-by-side with one or more other accounts. We do not intend to make any investments if they are not permitted by applicable law and interpretive positions of the SEC and its staff, or if they are inconsistent with GC Advisors allocation procedures.\nIn addition, we have adopted a formal code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and GC Advisors officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors under our valuation policy and process.\nValuation methods include comparisons of the portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, determination of the enterprise value of a portfolio company, discounted cash flow analysis and a market interest rate approach. The factors that are taken into account in fair value pricing investments include: available current market data, including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables; applicable market yields and multiples; security covenants; call protection provisions; information rights; the nature and realizable value of any collateral; the portfolio companys ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows and the markets\nin which it does business; comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public; comparable merger and acquisition transactions; and the principal market and enterprise values. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments can differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and differ materially from values that are ultimately received or settled.\nOur board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of GC Advisors responsible for credit monitoring. Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and GC Advisors. The audit committee of our board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. At least once annually the valuation for each portfolio investment, subject to a de minimis threshold, is reviewed by an independent valuation firm. The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith.\nDetermination of fair values involves subjective judgments and estimates. Under current accounting standards, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations, and any change in such valuations, on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe follow ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets or liabilities complexity. Our fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and may require significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and we consider factors specific to the asset or liability. We assess the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the year ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by us to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nValuation of Investments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of our board of directors to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of our valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. All investments as of September 30, 2022 with the exception of money market funds included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments) and forward currency contracts (Level 2 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs. All investments as of September 30, 2021, with the exception of money market funds included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and one portfolio company equity investment (Level 1 investments) and forward currency contracts (Level 2 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, we may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio companys EBITDA. A portfolio companys EBITDA may include pro-forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, we will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, we use a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, we may base our valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that we and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that we and others may be willing to accept. We generally use the midpoint of the bid/ask range as our best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If we were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, we may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.\nOur investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nPursuant to Rule 2a-5 under the 1940 Act, as recently amended, the board of directors of a registered investment company or BDC is permitted to delegate to a valuation designee, which could be its investment adviser, the responsibility to determine fair value of investments in good faith subject to the oversight of the board. Our board of directors has determined to continue its determination of fair value of our investments for which market quotations are not readily available in accordance with our valuation policies and procedures and has not designated GC Advisors or any other entity as a valuation designee.\nValuation of Other Financial Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair value of the 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of our remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\nRevenue Recognition:\nOur revenue recognition policies are as follows:\nInvestments and Related Investment Income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments. Premiums, discounts, and origination fees are amortized or accreted into interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. For investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not likely to be collectible. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, administrative agent fees, consulting fees and prepayment premiums on loans and record these fees as fee income when earned. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans as fee income. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Distributions received from limited liability company, or LLC, and limited partnership, or LP, investments are evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, we will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the cost basis of the investment.\nWe account for investment transactions on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We report changes in fair value of investments from the prior period that is measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and fluctuations arising from the translation of foreign exchange rates on investments in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-accrual: Loans may be left on accrual status during the period we are pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become past due 90 days or more on principal and interest or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected for possible placement on non-accrual status. We generally reverse accrued interest when a loan is placed on non-accrual. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon managements judgment. We restore non-accrual loans to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in our managements judgment, are likely to remain current. The total fair value of our non-accrual loans was $65.1 million and $46.1 million as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nIncome taxes: We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to be subject to tax as a RIC, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, as well as timely distribute to our stockholders dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. We have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from U.S. federal income taxes.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We may then be\nrequired to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not incur any U.S federal excise tax.\nWe have consolidated subsidiaries that are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a net tax expense of $1.2 million for taxable subsidiaries. For the year ended September 30, 2021, we recorded a net tax expense $0.5 million for taxable subsidiaries. For the year ended September 30, 2020, we did not record a net tax expense for taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2022, we recorded a net deferred tax liability, reported within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, of $1.4 million for taxable subsidiaries, primarily due to unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, we recorded a net deferred tax liability, reported within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, of $0.5 million for taxable subsidiaries, primarily due to unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries.\nBecause federal income tax regulations differ from GAAP, distributions in accordance with tax regulations may differ from net investment income and realized gains recognized for financial reporting purposes. Differences may be permanent or temporary. Permanent differences are reclassified within capital accounts in the financial statements to reflect their tax character. For example, permanent differences in classification may result from the treatment of distributions paid from short-term gains as ordinary income dividends for tax purposes. Temporary differences arise when certain items of income, expense, gain or loss are recognized at some time in the future. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Many of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates, and we expect that our loans in the future may also have floating interest rates. These loans are usually based on floating LIBOR, SOFR or another base rate and typically have interest rate reset provisions that adjust applicable interest rates under such loans to current market rates on a daily, monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual basis. The loans that are subject to floating LIBOR, SOFR or another base rate are also typically subject to a minimum base rate, or floor, that we charge on our loans if the current market rates are below the respective floors. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the weighted average floor on loans subject to floating interest rates was 0.83% and 0.90%, respectively. The Class A, B and C-1 2018 Notes issued in connection with the 2018 Debt Securitization have floating rate interest provisions based on three-month LIBOR that reset quarterly, as do the Class A-1 and B-1 GCIC 2018 Notes as issued as part of the GCIC 2018 Debt Securitization. The JPM Credit Facility has a floating interest rate provision that, as of September 13, 2022, is primarily based on an applicable base rate (as defined in Note 7) plus a spread that ranges from 1.75% to 1.875% plus a spread adjustment ranging between 0.11448% and 0.42826%. We expect that other credit facilities into which we enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions.\nAssuming that the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2022 were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter interest rate sensitivity as of such date, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates.\nChange in interest rates Increase (decrease) in\ninterest income(1)\nIncrease (decrease) in\ninterest expense Net increase\n(decrease) in\ninvestment income\n(In thousands)\nDown 200 basis points $ (104,470) $ (32,165) $ (72,305)\nDown 150 basis points (78,811) (24,124) (54,687)\nDown 100 basis points (52,882) (16,082) (36,800)\nDown 50 basis points (26,450) (8,041) (18,409)\nUp 50 basis points 26,475 8,041 18,434\nUp 100 basis points 52,951 16,082 36,869\nUp 150 basis points 79,426 24,124 55,302\nUp 200 basis points 105,902 32,165 73,737\n(1) Assumes applicable three-month base rate as of September 30, 2022, with the exception of SONIA and Prime that utilize the September 30, 2022 rate.\nAlthough we believe that this analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes as of September 30, 2022, it does not adjust for changes in the credit market, credit quality, the size and composition of the assets in our portfolio and other business developments, including borrowings under the Debt Securitizations, the JPM Credit Facility, Adviser Revolver, or other borrowings, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, we can offer no assurances that actual results would not differ materially from the analysis above.\nWe may in the future hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as interest rate swaps, futures, options and forward contracts to the limited extent permitted under the 1940 Act and applicable commodities laws. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: 42)\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of September 30, 2022 and 2021\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Net Assets for the Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Schedules of Investments as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nManagements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. (GBDC, and collectively with its subsidiaries, the Company, we, us, our and Golub Capital BDC) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nGolub Capital BDCs internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions recorded necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our policies and procedures also provide reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of Golub Capital BDC, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness as to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of Golub Capital BDCs internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued in 2013. Based on the assessment, management believes that, as of September 30, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nGolub Capital BDCs independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. This report appears on page 120.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company), including the consolidated schedules of investments, as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations, changes in its net assets, and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Companys management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our procedures included confirmation of investments owned as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, by correspondence with the custodians, the underlying investees and broker. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of investments using significant unobservable inputs and assumptions\nDescription of the Matter At September 30, 2022, the fair value of the Companys investments categorized as Level 3 investments within the fair value hierarchy (Level 3 investments) totaled $5,446,356 thousand. Management determines the fair value of the Companys Level 3 investments by applying the methodologies outlined in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements and using significant unobservable inputs and assumptions. Determining the fair value of the Level 3 investments requires management to make judgments about the valuation methodologies (i.e., market approach or income approach) and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions including, among others, EBITDA multiples, revenue multiples, and market interest rates for similar loans with similar credit profiles, used in determining the fair value measurements.\nAuditing the fair value of the Companys Level 3 investments was complex, as the unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company are highly judgmental, are sensitive to economic dislocations, and could have a significant effect on the fair value measurements of such investments.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Companys investment valuation process. This included controls over managements assessment of the valuation methodologies and significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in determining the fair value measurements of the Level 3 investments.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Companys valuation methodologies, testing the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of the Companys Level 3 investments, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the Companys valuation calculations. For each Level 3 investment, we reviewed the information considered by the Board of Directors relating to the Companys determination of fair value. For a sample of the Companys Level 3 investments, with the involvement of our valuation specialists, we independently developed fair value estimates and compared them to the Companys estimates. We developed our independent fair value estimates by using borrower financial information, which we compared to agreements or underlying source documents provided to the Company by the borrowers, and available market information from third-party sources, such as market spreads, market multiples, and leverage. In developing our independent fair value estimates, we considered the impact of current economic conditions on trends in borrower financial information and the resulting fair value estimates. We also evaluated subsequent events and other available information and considered whether they corroborated or contradicted the Companys year-end valuations.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Companys auditor since 2015.\nChicago, Illinois\nNovember 21, 2022\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Golub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated statements of financial condition, including the consolidated schedules of investments, of the Company as of September 30, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, changes in net assets, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2022, and the related notes and our report dated November 21, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nNovember 21, 2022\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\n(In thousands, except share and per share data)\nSeptember 30, 2022 September 30, 2021\nAssets\nInvestments, at fair value\nNon-controlled/non-affiliate company investments $ 5,374,594 $ 4,815,270\nNon-controlled affiliate company investments 57,689 61,379\nControlled affiliate company investments 14,073 18,237\nTotal investments, at fair value (amortized cost of $5,569,604 and $4,895,397, respectively)\n5,446,356 4,894,886\nCash and cash equivalents 117,290 175,593\nForeign currencies (cost of $7,021 and $5,145, respectively)\n6,847 5,497\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n56,416 61,824\nRestricted foreign currencies (cost of $0 and $1,442, respectively)\n- 1,429\nCash collateral held at broker for forward currency contracts -

For each, the Company has provided the spread over the applicable index and the weighted average current interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2021. Certain investments are subject to an interest rate floor. For fixed rate loans, a spread above a reference rate is not applicable. For positions with multiple outstanding contracts, the spread for the largest outstanding contract is shown. Listed below are the index rates as of September 30, 2021, which was the last business day of the period on which the applicable index rates were determined.

See Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\n(5)The negative fair value is the result of the capitalized discount on the loan or the unfunded commitment being valued below par. The negative amortized cost is the result of the capitalized discount being greater than the principal amount outstanding on the loan.\n(6)The entire commitment was unfunded as of September 30, 2021. As such, no interest is being earned on this investment. The investment may be subject to an unused facility fee.\n(7)Loan was on non-accrual status as of September 30, 2021, meaning that the Company has ceased recognizing interest income on the loan.\n(8)The investment is treated as a non-qualifying asset under Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act.

Organization\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. (GBDC and, collectively with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. GBDC has elected to be regulated as a business development company (BDC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act). In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, GBDC has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (RIC) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code).\nThe Companys investment strategy is to invest primarily in one stop (a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans and that are often referred to by other middle-market lenders as unitranche loans) and other senior secured loans of U.S. middle-market companies that are, in most cases, sponsored by private equity firms. The Company also selectively invests in second lien and subordinated (a loan that ranks senior only to a borrowers equity securities and ranks junior to all of such borrowers other indebtedness in priority of payment) loans of, and warrants and minority equity securities in, U.S. middle-market companies. The Company has entered into the Third Amended and Restated Investment Advisory Agreement dated as of September 16, 2019 (the Investment Advisory Agreement) with GC Advisors LLC (the Investment Adviser), under which the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company. Under an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement) the Company is provided with certain services by an administrator (the Administrator), which is currently Golub Capital LLC.\nOn September 16, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Golub Capital Investment Corporation (GCIC), a Maryland corporation, pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended, the Merger Agreement), dated as of November 27, 2018, by and among the Company, GCIC, Fifth Ave Subsidiary Inc., a Maryland corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the Investment Adviser, and, for certain limited purposes, the Administrator.\nOn January 1, 2020 the Company entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with RGA\nReinsurance Company (RGA), Aurora National Life Assurance Company (Aurora), Senior Loan Fund\n(SLF), and GCIC Senior Loan Fund LLC (GCIC SLF). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, RGA and Aurora\n(together the Transferors) agreed to sell their limited liability company (LLC) equity interests in SLF and GCIC\nSLF, respectively, to the Company, effective as of January 1, 2020. As a result of the Purchase Agreement, on\nJanuary 1, 2020, SLF and GCIC SLF became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company and the capital\ncommitments of the Transferors to SLF and GCIC SLF were terminated.\nNote 2. Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Updates\nBasis of presentation: The Company is an investment company as defined in the accounting and reporting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 946 - Financial Services - Investment Companies (ASC Topic 946).\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and related financial information have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for the financial information and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-K and Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications consisting solely of normal accruals that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nFair value of financial instruments: The Company applies fair value to all of its financial instruments in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement (ASC Topic 820). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nentity-specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Companys own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3.\nAny changes to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management and the Companys board of directors (the Board) to confirm that the changes are appropriate. As markets change, new products develop and the pricing for products becomes more or less transparent, the Company will continue to refine its valuation methodologies. See further description of fair value methodology in Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\nUse of estimates: The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nConsolidation: As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company. Accordingly, the Company consolidated\nthe results of the Companys wholly-owned subsidiaries Golub Capital BDC CLO III Depositor LLC (2018 CLO Depositor); Golub Capital BDC CLO III LLC (2018 Issuer); Golub Capital BDC Holdings, LLC (BDC Holdings); GCIC Holdings LLC (GCIC Holdings); GCIC CLO II Depositor LLC (GCIC 2018 CLO Depositor); GCIC CLO II LLC (GCIC 2018 Issuer); GCIC Funding II LLC (GCIC Funding II); prior to its dissolution on August 26, 2020, Golub Capital BDC CLO 2014 LLC (2014 Issuer); prior to its dissolution on August 26, 2021, Golub Capital BDC CLO 4 LLC (2020 Issuer); prior to May 10, 2021, the date of each of the following entitys dissolution, GC SBIC IV, L.P. (SBIC IV), GCIC Senior Loan Fund LLC and GCIC Senior Loan Fund II LLC; prior to March 23, 2022, the date of each of the following entitys dissolution, Golub Capital BDC CLO 4 Depositor LLC (2020 CLO Depositor), GC SBIC V, L.P. (SBIC V), Senior Loan Fund LLC and Senior Loan Fund II LLC; prior to its dissolution on September 16, 2022, Golub Capital BDC Funding II LLC (Funding II); and prior to September 27, 2022, the date of each of the following entitys dissolution, GCIC Funding LLC (GCIC Funding), Golub Capital BDC Funding LLC (Funding) and GC SBIC VI, L.P. (SBIC VI) . Prior to January 1, 2020, the Company did not consolidate its non-controlling interests in SLF, Senior Loan Fund II LLC (SLF II), GCIC SLF and GCIC Senior Loan Fund II (GCIC SLF II) (collectively, the Senior Loan Funds or SLFs). See further description of the Companys previous investments in the SLFs in Note 4. Investments.\nAssets related to transactions that do not meet ASC Topic 860 requirements for accounting sale treatment are reflected in the Companys Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as investments. Those assets are owned by special purpose entities, including BDC Holdings, 2018 Issuer, Funding II, GCIC Holdings and the GCIC 2018 Issuer that are consolidated in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The creditors of the special purpose entities have received security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of GBDC (or any affiliate of GBDC).\nCash and cash equivalents and foreign currencies: Cash, cash equivalents and foreign currencies are highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition. The Company deposits its cash in financial institutions and, at times, such balances exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies: Restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies include amounts that are collected and are held by trustees who have been appointed as custodians of the assets securing certain of the Companys financing transactions. Restricted cash and\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\ncash equivalents and restricted foreign currencies are held by the trustees for payment of interest expense and principal on the outstanding borrowings or reinvestment into new assets. In addition, for periods prior to the surrender of the applicable small business investment company (SBIC) licenses, restricted cash and cash equivalents included amounts held within the Companys SBIC subsidiaries. The amounts held within the SBICs were generally restricted to the originations of new loans by the SBICs and the payment of U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) debentures and related interest expense.\nForeign currency translation: The Companys books and records are maintained in U.S. dollars. Any foreign currency amounts are translated into U.S. dollars on the following basis:\n(1)Non-U.S. dollar transactions during the year are valued at the prevailing spot rates on the applicable transaction date and the related assets and liabilities are revalued at the prevailing spot rates as of year-end.\nNet assets and fair values are presented based on the applicable foreign exchange rates described above and fluctuations arising from the translation of assets and liabilities are included with the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on translation of assets and liabilities in foreign currencies on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nForeign security and currency transactions involve certain considerations and risks not typically associated with investing in U.S. companies. These risks include, but are not limited to, currency fluctuations and revaluations and future adverse political, social and economic developments, which could cause investments in foreign markets to be less liquid and prices more volatile than those of comparable U.S. companies or U.S. government securities.\nForward currency contracts: A forward currency contract is an obligation between two parties to purchase or sell a specific currency for an agreed-upon price at a future date. The Company utilized forward currency contracts to economically hedge the currency exposure associated with certain foreign-denominated investments. The use of forward currency contracts does not eliminate fluctuations in the price of the underlying securities the Company owns or intends to acquire but establishes a rate of exchange in advance. Fluctuations in the value of these contracts are measured by the difference in the exchange rates on the contract date and reporting date and are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) until the contracts are closed. When the contracts are closed, realized gains (losses) are recorded. Realized gains (losses) and unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on the contracts are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on forward currency contracts is recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition by counterparty on a net basis, not taking into account collateral posted which is recorded separately, if applicable.\nThe primary risks associated with forward currency contracts include failure of the counterparty to meet the terms of the contract and the value of the foreign currency changing unfavorably. These risks can exceed the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nRefer to Note 5 for more information regarding the forward currency contracts.\nRevenue recognition:\nInvestments and related investment income: Interest income is accrued based upon the outstanding principal amount and contractual interest terms of debt investments.\nLoan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and the Company accretes or amortizes such amounts over the life of the loan as interest income. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, interest income included $24,679, $21,399 and $16,437, respectively, of accretion of discounts. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received loan origination fees of $27,023, $34,215 and $13,072, respectively.\nFor investments with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the principal balance that generally becomes due at maturity, the Company will not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the PIK interest is not collectible. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nand 2020, the Company capitalized PIK interest of $21,506, $16,092 and $10,956, respectively, into the principal balance of certain debt investments.\nIn addition, the Company generates revenue in the form of amendment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, administrative agent fees, and prepayment premiums on loans. The Company records these fees as fee income when earned. All other income is recorded into income when earned.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, fee income included $3,040, $3,200 and $1,184, respectively, of prepayment premiums, which fees are non-recurring.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company received interest and fee income in cash, which excludes capitalized loan origination fees, in the amounts of $354,032, $301,687 and $312,933, respectively.\nDividend income on preferred equity securities is recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity securities is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies or on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Each distribution received from LLC and limited partnership (LP) investments is evaluated to determine if the distribution should be recorded as dividend income or a return of capital. Generally, the Company will not record distributions from equity investments in LLCs and LPs as dividend income unless there are sufficient accumulated tax-basis earnings and profits in the LLC or LP prior to the distribution. Distributions that are classified as a return of capital are recorded as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the investment.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded dividend income of $684 and $1,713, respectively, and return of capital distributions of $1,146 and $542, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2020, excluding the Company's investments in LLC equity interests in the SLFs, the Company recorded dividend income of $291 and return of capital distributions of $697. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company recorded dividend income of $1,905 and return of capital distributions of $4,375 from the Company's investments in LLC equity interests in the SLFs.\nInvestment transactions are accounted for on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. The Company reports current period changes in fair value of investments that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and foreign currency translation in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNon-accrual loans: A loan can be left on accrual status during the period the Company is pursuing repayment of the loan. Management reviews all loans that become 90 days or more past due on principal and interest, or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected, for possible placement on non-accrual status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Additionally, any original issue discount and market discount are no longer accreted to interest income as of the date the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans are recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon managements judgment. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in managements judgment, payments are likely to remain current. The total fair value of non-accrual loans was $65,125 and $46,104 as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively.\nPurchase accounting: The Merger was accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC 805 - Business Combinations - Related Issues (ASC Topic 805), also referred to as purchase accounting. Under asset acquisition accounting, acquiring assets in groups not only requires ascertaining the cost of the asset (or net assets), but also allocating that cost to the individual assets (or individual assets and liabilities) that make up the group. Per ASC Topic 805, assets are recognized based on their cost to the acquiring entity, which generally includes transaction costs of the asset acquisition, and no gain or loss is recognized unless the fair value of noncash assets given as consideration differs from the assets carrying amounts on the acquiring entitys books.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe cost of the group of assets acquired in an asset acquisition is allocated to the individual assets acquired or liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of net identifiable assets acquired other than non-qualifying assets (for example cash) and does not give rise to goodwill. To the extent that the consideration paid to GCICs stockholders exceeded the relative fair values of the net identifiable assets of GCIC acquired other than non-qualifying assets, any such premium paid by the Company was further allocated to the cost of the GCIC assets acquired by the Company pro-rata to their relative fair value, other than non-qualifying assets. As GCIC did not have any qualifying assets at the time of acquisition, the premium was allocated to non-qualifying assets, which are GCICs investments in loans and equity securities, including its investment in GCIC SLF. Immediately following the acquisition of GCIC, the Company recorded its assets at their respective fair values and, as a result, the purchase premium allocated to the cost basis of the GCIC assets acquired was immediately recognized as unrealized depreciation on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations. The purchase premium allocated to investments in loan securities will amortize over the life of the loans through interest income, with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation on the loans acquired from GCIC through their ultimate disposition. Amortization expense of purchase premium for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $15,632, $30,793 and $39,920, respectively. The purchase premium allocated to investments in equity securities will not amortize over the life of the equity securities through interest income and, assuming no subsequent change to the fair value of the equity securities acquired from GCIC and disposition of such equity securities at fair value, the Company will recognize a realized loss with a corresponding reversal of the unrealized depreciation upon disposition of the equity securities acquired from GCIC.\nThe Company's purchase of the equity interests in the Senior Loan Funds was accounted for under the asset acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805. As of January 1, 2020, the Company allocated the cost to acquire the net assets of the Senior Loans Funds to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the relative fair values of identifiable assets and liabilities. The total consideration transferred by the Company to acquire the Senior Loans Funds was $140,124, which was comprised of $17,011 paid to RGA and Aurora for their minority interests in the Senior Loan Funds and the derecognition of the Company's existing carrying cost of the investments in the Senior Loans Funds, as of January 1, 2020, of $123,113. As of January 1, 2020, the fair value of the net assets of the Senior Loan Funds was $136,088, which resulted in a $4,036 purchase premium that the Company recognized as realized loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIncome taxes: The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operates in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to its stockholders of an amount generally at least equal to 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid, for each tax year. The Company has made, and intends to continue to make, the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its stockholders.\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company can determine to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions and distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company may then be required to incur a 4% excise tax on such income. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. No U.S. federal excise tax was accrued or paid for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in conformity with ASC Topic 740 - Income Taxes (ASC Topic 740). ASC Topic 740 provides guidelines for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in financial statements. ASC Topic 740 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Companys tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax expense or tax benefit in the current year. It is the Companys policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. There were no material unrecognized tax benefits or unrecognized tax liabilities related to uncertain income tax positions through\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nSeptember 30, 2022. The Company's tax returns for the 2019 through 2021 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities.\nCertain of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. Income tax expense, if any, is included under the income category for which it applies in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDividends and distributions: Dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company can retain such capital gains for investment in its discretion.\nThe Company has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes and the Company declares a cash distribution, then stockholders who participate in the DRIP will have their cash distribution reinvested in additional shares of the Companys common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. The Company expects to use newly issued shares under the guidelines of the DRIP if the Companys shares are trading at a premium to net asset value. The Company can purchase shares in the open market in connection with the obligations under the plan, and in particular, if the Companys shares are trading at a significant discount to net asset value (NAV) and the Company is otherwise permitted under applicable law to purchase such shares, the Company intends to purchase shares in the open market in connection with any obligations under the DRIP.\nIn the event the market price per share of the Companys common stock on the date of a distribution exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share of the common stock, the Company will issue shares of common stock to participants in the DRIP at the greater of the most recently computed NAV per share of common stock or 95% of the current market price per share of common stock (or such lesser discount to the current market price per share that still exceeds the most recently computed NAV per share of common stock).\nShare repurchase plan: The Company has a share repurchase program (the Program) which allows the Company to repurchase the Companys outstanding common stock on the open market at prices below the Companys NAV as reported in its most recently published consolidated financial statements. The Board most recently reapproved the Program in August 2022 and the Program is implemented at the discretion of management. Shares can be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices, through open market transactions, including block transactions. The Program permits repurchases up to $150,000 of the Company's common stock. The Company did not make any repurchases of its common stock during each of the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nEquity Distribution Agreement: On May 28, 2021, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement (the Equity Distribution Agreement), by and among the Company, the Investment Adviser, Golub Capital LLC and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. (the Placement Agent), in connection with the sale by the Company of shares of its common stock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $250,000, in an at the market offering, in amounts and at times to be determined by the Company. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company from time to time, including, among others, market conditions and the market price of the Companys common stock. The Equity Distribution Agreement provides that the Company may offer and sell shares from time to time through the Placement Agent, or to it. Sales of the shares, if any, may be made in negotiated transactions or transactions that are deemed to be at the market, as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The Nasdaq Global Select Market or any similar securities exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on a securities exchange, at prices related to the prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. Pursuant to the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, the Placement Agent will receive a commission from the Company of up to 1.25% of the gross sales price of any shares sold through the Placement Agent under the Equity Distribution Agreement. Offering costs for the Equity Distribution Agreement are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when proceeds are received. During the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock under the Equity Distribution Agreement.\nDeferred debt issuance costs: Deferred debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with the Companys borrowings. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nCompany had deferred debt issuance costs of $17,211 and $17,850, respectively. These amounts are amortized and included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the estimated average life of the borrowings. Amortization expense for deferred debt issuance costs for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $7,337, $10,203 and $3,534, respectively.\nDeferred offering costs: Deferred offering costs consist of fees paid in relation to legal, accounting, regulatory and printing work completed in preparation of equity offerings. Deferred offering costs are charged against the proceeds from equity offerings when received. These amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nNote 3. Related Party Transactions\nInvestment Advisory Agreement: Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, GBDC. The Board most recently reapproved the Investment Advisory Agreement in May 2022. The Investment Adviser is a registered investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The Investment Adviser receives fees for providing services, consisting of two components, a base management fee and an Incentive Fee (as defined below).\nThe base management fee is calculated at an annual rate equal to 1.375% of average adjusted gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters (including assets purchased with borrowed funds and securitization-related assets, leverage, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit with custodian but adjusted to exclude cash and cash equivalents so that investors do not pay the base management fee on such assets) and is payable quarterly in arrears. Additionally, the Investment Adviser voluntarily excludes any assets funded with secured borrowing proceeds from the base management fee calculation. The base management fee is adjusted, based on the actual number of days elapsed relative to the total number of days in such calendar quarter, for any share issuances or repurchases during such calendar quarter. For purposes of the Investment Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents mean U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 270 days of purchase (which is different than the GAAP definition, which defines cash equivalents as U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within 90 days of purchase). To the extent that the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates provides investment advisory, collateral management or other similar services to a subsidiary of the Company, the base management fee will be reduced by an amount equal to the product of (1) the total fees paid to the Investment Adviser by such subsidiary for such services and (2) the percentage of such subsidiarys total equity, including membership interests and any class of notes not exclusively held by one or more third parties, that is owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company.\nThe Investment Adviser served as collateral manager under the 2014 Collateral Management Agreement (as defined in Note 7) and the 2020 Collateral Management Agreement (as defined in Note 7) and serves as collateral manager under the 2018 Collateral Management Agreement (as defined in Note 7) and the GCIC 2018 Collateral Management Agreement (as defined in Note 7). Fees payable to the Investment Adviser for providing these services are offset against the base management fee payable by the Company under the Investment Advisory Agreement.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Investment Adviser irrevocably waived $1,904 of base management fees. After taking into account the waiver by the Investment Adviser, the base management fee\nincurred was $71,962 rather than $73,866 for the year ended September 30, 2022.\nDuring the year ended September 30, 2021, the Investment Adviser irrevocably waived $4,000 of base management fees. After taking into account the waiver by the Investment Adviser, the base management fee incurred was $57,858 rather than $61,858 for the year ended September 30, 2021.\nThe Company has structured the calculation of the Incentive Fee to include a fee limitation such that an Incentive Fee for any quarter can only be paid to the Investment Adviser if, after such payment, the cumulative Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser, calculated on a per share basis, since April 13, 2010, the effective date of the Companys election to become a BDC, would be less than or equal to 20.0% of the Companys Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income (as defined below).\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe Company accomplishes this limitation by subjecting each quarterly Incentive Fee payable under the Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation (as defined below) to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap). Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is equal to the difference between (a) 20.0% of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share (as defined below) and (b) Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share (as defined below). To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any quarter, no Incentive Fee would be payable in that quarter. If, for any relevant period, the Incentive Fee Cap calculation results in the Company paying less than the amount of the Incentive Fee calculated above, then the difference between the Incentive Fee and the Incentive Fee Cap will not be paid by GBDC and will not be received by the Investment Adviser as an Incentive Fee either at the end of such relevant period or at the end of any future period. Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share equals the sum of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share (as defined below) for each quarterly period since April 13, 2010. Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income Per Share equals the sum of (i) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (as defined below) and (ii) Adjusted Capital Returns for the applicable period, divided by (b) the weighted average number of shares of GBDC common stock outstanding during such period. Adjusted Capital Returns for any period is the sum of the realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate unrealized capital appreciation for such period; provided that the calculation of realized aggregate capital gains, realized aggregate capital losses, aggregate unrealized capital depreciation and aggregate unrealized capital appreciation shall not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation resulting solely from the purchase accounting for any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger. Cumulative Incentive Fees Paid Per Share is equal to the sum of Incentive Fees Paid Per Share since April 13, 2010. Incentive Fees Paid Per Share for any period is equal to the Incentive Fees accrued and/or payable to the Company for such period, divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock of GBDC during such period.\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the calendar quarter (including the base management fee, taxes, any expenses payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement, any expenses of securitizations and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.\nIncentive Fees are calculated and payable quarterly in arrears (or, upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date).\nThe income and capital gains incentive fee calculation (the Income and Capital Gain Incentive Fee Calculation) has two parts, the income component (the Income Incentive Fee) and the capital gains component (the Capital Gain Incentive Fee and, together with the Income Incentive Fee, the Incentive Fee). The Income Incentive Fee is calculated quarterly in arrears based on the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.\nFor the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Income Incentive Fee incurred was $17,756, $3,214 and $13,831, respectively.\nThe Investment Advisory Agreement excludes the impact of purchase accounting resulting from a merger, including the Merger, from the calculation of income subject to the Income Incentive Fee and the calculation of the Incentive Fee Cap. As a result, under the Investment Advisory Agreement, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation or any amortization or accretion of any purchase premium or discount to interest income solely from the purchase accounting for any premium or discount paid for the acquisition of assets in a merger, such as the premium to net asset value paid for the shares of GCIC common stock in the Merger. Because of the structure of the Income Incentive Fee, it is possible that an Incentive Fee is calculated under this formula with respect to a period in which the Company has incurred a loss. For example, if the Company receives Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a calendar quarter, the Income Incentive Fee will result in a positive value and an Incentive Fee will be paid even if the Company has incurred a loss in such period due to realized and/or\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nunrealized capital losses unless the payment of such Incentive Fee would cause the Company to pay Incentive Fees on a cumulative basis that exceed the Incentive Fee Cap.\nPre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Companys net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any Incentive Fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed hurdle rate of 2.0% quarterly.\nIf market interest rates rise, it is possible that the Company will be able to invest funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and make it easier for the Investment Adviser to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an Incentive Fee based on such net investment income.\nThe Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income used to calculate this part of the Incentive Fee is also included in the amount of its total assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds and securitization-related assets, unrealized depreciation or appreciation on derivative instruments and cash collateral on deposit with custodian) used to calculate the 1.375% base management fee annual rate.\nThe Company calculates the Income Incentive Fee with respect to its Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income quarterly, in arrears, as follows:\nZero in any calendar quarter in which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not exceed the hurdle rate;\n100% of the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter. This portion of the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) is referred to as the catch-up provision. The catch-up is meant to provide the Investment Adviser with 20.0% of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and\n20.0% of the amount of the Companys Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter.\nThe Capital Gain Incentive Fee equals (a) 20.0% of the Companys Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base (as defined below), if any, calculated in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), which commenced with the calendar year ending December 31, 2010, less (b) the aggregate amount of any previously paid Capital Gain Incentive Fees. The Companys Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base equals (1) the sum of (i) realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative positive basis from the date the Company elected to become a BDC through the end of each calendar year, (ii) all realized capital losses on a cumulative basis and (iii) all unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis less (2) all unamortized deferred debt issuance costs, if and to the extent such costs exceed all unrealized capital appreciation on a cumulative basis.\nThe cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Companys portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\nThe cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in the Companys portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\nThe aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Companys portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gain Incentive Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.\nRealized capital gains and losses include gains and losses on investments, foreign currencies, including gains and losses on borrowings in foreign currencies, derivative contracts and any income tax related to cumulative aggregate realized gains and losses. In accordance with GAAP, the Company also is required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nappreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Advisory Agreement, as applicable. If the Capital Gain Incentive Fee Base, adjusted as required by GAAP to include unrealized capital appreciation, is positive at the end of a period, then GAAP requires the Company to accrue a capital gain incentive fee equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of the actual Capital Gain Incentive Fees paid and capital gain incentive fees accrued under GAAP in all prior periods. If such amount is negative, then there is no accrual for such period. The resulting accrual under GAAP in a given period results in additional expense if such cumulative amount is greater than in the prior period or a reversal of previously recorded expense if such cumulative amount is less than in the prior period. There can be no assurance that such unrealized capital appreciation will be realized in the future. For the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company did not accrue a capital gain incentive fee. Changes in the accrual for the capital gain incentive fee are included in incentive fee in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there was no cumulative accrual of capital gain incentive fees under GAAP included in management and incentive fees payable on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there was no Capital Gain Incentive Fee payable as calculated under the Investment Advisory Agreement as described above. Any payment due for a Capital Gain Incentive Fee under the terms of the Investment Advisory Agreement is calculated in arrears at the end of each calendar year.\nAdministration Agreement: Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes the Company with office facilities and equipment, provides the Company with clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities and provides the Company with other administrative services as the Administrator, subject to review by the Board, determines necessary to conduct the Companys day-to-day operations. The Company reimburses the Administrator the allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, fees and expenses associated with performing compliance functions and the Company's allocable portion of the cost of its chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs. The Board reviews such expenses to determine that these expenses, including any allocation of expenses among the Company and other entities for which the Administrator provides similar services, are reasonable and comparable to administrative services charged by unaffiliated third party asset managers. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator also provides, on the Companys behalf, managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which the Company is required to provide such assistance and will be paid an additional amount based on the cost of the services provided, which amount shall not exceed the amount the Company receives from such portfolio companies.\nIncluded in accounts payable and other liabilities is $1,976 and $1,769 as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, respectively, for accrued allocated shared services under the Administration Agreement.\nOther related party transactions: The Administrator pays for certain unaffiliated third-party expenses incurred by the Company. Such expenses include postage, printing, office supplies, rating agency fees and professional fees. These expenses are not marked-up and represent the same amount the Company would have paid had the Company paid the expenses directly. These expenses are subsequently reimbursed in cash.\nTotal expenses reimbursed to the Administrator during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $6,240, $6,950 and $6,378, respectively.\nAs of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, included in accounts payable and other liabilities were $2,049 and $2,523, respectively, for expenses paid on behalf of the Company by the Administrator.\nThe Company is party to an unsecured revolving credit facility with the Investment Adviser (as amended, the Adviser Revolver) which, as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021 permits the Company to borrow a maximum of $100,000 and expires on June 15, 2025. Refer to Note 7. Borrowings for discussion of the Adviser Revolver.\nOn October 2, 2020, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser (the Affiliate) purchased $40,000 principal of the Companys 2024 Unsecured Notes (defined in Note 7) and on October 9, 2020, the Affiliate sold $15,000 principal of its position to an unaffiliated party. On May 21, 2021, the Affiliate sold the remaining $25,000 principal of the Companys 2024 Unsecured Notes to an unaffiliated party.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nNote 4.

Master Agreement (ISDA Master Agreement) with its derivative counterparty, Macquarie Bank Limited (Macquarie). The ISDA Master Agreement is a bilateral agreement between the Company and Macquarie that governs over the counter (OTC) derivatives, including forward currency contracts, and contains, among other things, collateral posting terms and netting provisions in the event of a default and/or termination event. The provisions of the ISDA Master Agreement permit a single net payment in the event of a default (close-out netting) or similar event, including the bankruptcy or insolvency of the counterparty.\nFor financial reporting purposes, cash collateral that has been pledged to cover obligations of the Company and cash collateral received from Macquarie, if any, is included in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition as cash collateral held at broker for forward currency contracts or cash collateral received from broker for forward currency contracts. The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with counterparties that it believes to be of good standing and by monitoring the financial stability of those counterparties.\nThe following table is intended to provide additional information about the effect of the forward currency contracts on the financial statements of the Company including: the fair value of derivatives by risk category, the location of those fair values on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, and the Companys gross and net amount of assets and liabilities available for offset under netting arrangements as well as any related collateral received or pledged by the Company as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022\nCounterparty Risk exposure category Unrealized appreciation on forward currency contracts Unrealized depreciation on forward currency contracts Net amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Collateral (Received) Pledged (1)\nNet Amount (2)\nMacquarie Bank Limited Foreign exchange $ 32,333 $ - $ 32,333 $ - $ 32,333\nAs of September 30, 2021\nCounterparty Risk exposure category Unrealized appreciation on forward currency contracts Unrealized depreciation on forward currency contracts Net amounts presented in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition Collateral (Received) Pledged (1)\nNet Amount (2)\nMacquarie Bank Limited Foreign exchange $ 2,716 $ (2,626) $ 90 $ - $ 90\n(1) The actual collateral pledged may be more than the amount shown due to over collateralization.\n(2)Represents the net amount due from/(to) counterparties in the event of default.\nThe impact of derivative transactions for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including realized and unrealized gains (losses) is summarized in the table below:\nRealized gain (loss) on forward currency contracts recognized in income\nRisk exposure category Year ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nForeign exchange $ 1,080 $ - $ -\nChange in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on forward currency contracts recognized in income\nRisk exposure category Year ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nForeign exchange $ 32,243 $ 1,154 $ (949)\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe following table is a summary of the average outstanding daily volume for forward currency contracts for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nAverage U.S. Dollar notional outstanding Year ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nForward currency contracts $ 254,118 $ 94,304 $ 36,396\nExclusion of the Investment Adviser from Commodity Pool Operator Definition\nEngaging in commodity interest transactions such as swap transactions or futures contracts for the Company may cause the Investment Adviser to fall within the definition of commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA) and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC) regulations. The Investment Adviser has claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the CEA and the CFTC regulations in connection with its management of the Company and, therefore, is not subject to CFTC registration or regulation under the CEA as a commodity pool operator with respect to its management of the Company.\nNote 6. Fair Value Measurements\nThe Company follows ASC Topic 820 for measuring fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters, or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied. These valuation models involve some level of management estimation and judgment, the degree of which is dependent on the price transparency for the assets or liabilities or market and the assets or liabilities complexity. The Companys fair value analysis includes an analysis of the value of any unfunded loan commitments. Assets and liabilities are categorized for disclosure purposes based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their value. The valuation hierarchical levels are based upon the transparency of the inputs to the valuation of the asset or liability as of the measurement date. The three levels are defined as follows:\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2: Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3: Inputs include significant unobservable inputs for the assets or liabilities and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the assets or liabilities. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information available and require significant management judgment or estimation.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an assets or a liabilitys categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021. The following section describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nInvestments\nLevel 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of each portfolio investment without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with approximately 25% (based on the number of portfolio companies) of the Companys valuations of debt and equity investments without readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. All investments as of September 30, 2022, with the exception of money market funds included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents (Level 1 investments) and forward currency contracts (Level 2 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs. All investments as of September 30, 2021, with the exception of money market funds included in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents and one portfolio company equity investment (Level 1 investments) and forward currency contracts (Level 2 investments), were valued using Level 3 inputs.\nWhen determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company takes into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio companys ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that affect the price at which similar investments are made and other relevant factors. The primary method for determining enterprise value uses a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio companys net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). A portfolio companys EBITDA can include pro forma adjustments for items such as acquisitions, divestitures, or expense reductions. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.\nIn addition, for certain debt investments, the Company bases its valuation on indicative bid and ask prices provided by an independent third party pricing service. Bid prices reflect the highest price that the Company and others may be willing to pay. Ask prices represent the lowest price that the Company and others may be willing to accept. The Company generally uses the midpoint of the bid/ask range as its best estimate of fair value of such investment.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that are ultimately received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded. The Companys investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe following tables present fair value measurements of the Companys investments and indicate the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair value as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021:\nAs of September 30, 2022 Fair Value Measurements Using\nDescription Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total\nAssets, at fair value:\nDebt investments(1)\n$ -

The Company uses EBITDA multiples and, to a lesser extent, revenue multiples on its debt and equity investments to determine any credit gains or losses. Increases or decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The Company uses market interest rates for loans to determine if the effective yield on a loan is commensurate with the market yields for that type of loan. If a loans effective yield was significantly less than the market yield for a similar loan with a similar credit profile, then the resulting fair value of the loan may have been lower.\nOther Financial Assets and Liabilities\nASC Topic 820 requires disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate such value. As a result, with the exception of the line item titled debt which is reported at cost, all assets and liabilities approximate fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition due to their short maturity. The fair value of the Company's 2024 Notes, 2026 Notes and 2027 Notes (as defined in Note 7. Borrowings) is based on vendor pricing received by the Company, which is considered a Level 2 input. The fair value of the Companys remaining debt is estimated using Level 3 inputs by discounting remaining payments using comparable market rates or market quotes for similar instruments at the measurement date, if available.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe following are the carrying values and fair values of the Companys debt as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021.\nAs of September 30, 2022 As of September 30, 2021\nCarrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value\nDebt $ 3,093,603 $ 2,902,210 $ 2,569,228 $ 2,594,368\nNote 7. Borrowings\nIn accordance with the 1940 Act, with certain limited exceptions, prior to February 6, 2019, the Company was allowed to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was at least 200% after such borrowing. On February 5, 2019, the Companys stockholders voted to approve the asset coverage requirement decrease to 150% from 200% in accordance with Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. Effective February 6, 2019, the reduced asset coverage requirement permits the Company to have a ratio of total consolidated assets to outstanding indebtedness of 2:1 as compared to a maximum of 1:1 under the 200% asset coverage requirement. As of September 30, 2022, the Companys asset coverage for borrowed amounts was 181.7%.\nDebt Securitizations:\nOn June 5, 2014, the Company completed a $402,569 term debt securitization (2014 Debt Securitization). The notes (2014 Notes) offered in the 2014 Debt Securitization were issued by the 2014 Issuer and are secured by a diversified portfolio of senior secured and second lien loans held by the 2014 Issuer. The 2014 Debt Securitization initially consisted of $191,000 of Aaa/AAA Class A-1 2014 Notes, $20,000 of Aaa/AAA Class A-2 2014 Notes and $35,000 of Aa2/AA Class B 2014 Notes. In partial consideration for the loans transferred to the 2014 Issuer as part of the 2014 Debt Securitization, the Company received and retained $37,500 of Class C 2014 Notes and $119,069 of LLC equity interests in the 2014 Issuer. On March 23, 2018, the Company and the 2014 Issuer amended the 2014 Debt Securitization to, among other things, (a) refinance the issued Class A-1 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $191,000 of Class A-1 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-1-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $191,000 that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, which is a decrease from the rate of three month LIBOR plus 1.75% of the previously outstanding Class A-1 2014 Notes, (b) refinance the Class A-2 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $20,000 of Class A-2 2014 Notes and issuing new Class A-2-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $20,000 that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 0.95%, which is a decrease from the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.95% of the previously outstanding Class A-2 2014 Notes, (c ) refinance the Class B 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $35,000 of Class B 2014 Notes and issuing new Class BR 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $35,000 that bear interest at a rate of three-month LIBOR plus 1.40%, which is a decrease from the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 2.50% of the previously outstanding Class B 2014 Notes, (d) refinance the Class C 2014 Notes by redeeming in full the $37,500 of Class C 2014 Notes and issuing new Class C-R 2014 Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $37,500 that bear interest at a rate of three month LIBOR plus 1.55%, which is a decrease from the rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.50% of the previously outstanding Class C 2014 Notes. The Class C-R 2014 Notes were retained by the Company.\nThrough April 28, 2018, all principal collections received on the underlying collateral could have been used by the 2014 Issuer to purchase new collateral under the direction of the Investment Adviser in its capacity as collateral manager of the 2014 Issuer and in accordance with the Companys investment strategy, allowing the Company to maintain the initial leverage in the 2014 Debt Securitization.\nOn August 26, 2020, in connection with a new term debt securitization, the 2014 Issuer redeemed the outstanding 2014 Notes pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing such 2014 Notes. Following such redemption, the agreements governed the 2014 Debt Securitization were terminated. The 2014 Notes would have otherwise matured on April 25, 2026.\nThe pool of loans in the 2014 Debt Securitization were required to meet certain requirements, including asset mix and concentration, collateral coverage, term, agency rating, minimum coupon, minimum spread and sector diversity requirements.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe interest charged under the 2014 Debt Securitization was based on three-month LIBOR.

Federal Income Tax Matters\nThe Company has elected to be treated and intends to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a result, the Company must distribute substantially all of its net taxable income each tax year as dividends to its stockholders.\nDividends from net investment income and distributions from net realized capital gains are determined in accordance with U.S. federal tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and those differences could be material. These book-to-tax differences are either temporary or permanent in nature. Reclassifications due to permanent book-tax differences have no impact on net assets.\nThe following permanent differences were reclassified for tax purposes among the components of net assets for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nYears ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nIncrease (decrease) in Paid in Capital in Excess of Par $ (750) $ (1,425) $ -\nIncrease (decrease) in Distributable Earnings (Losses) 750 1,425 -\nTaxable income generally differs from net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses and generally excludes unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investment transactions as investment gains and losses are not included in taxable income until they are realized.\nThe following table reconciles net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations to taxable income for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020:\nYears ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nNet increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations $ 153,440 $ 340,280 $ 54,872\nNet change in unrealized (appreciation) depreciation on investment transactions\n61,898 (165,246) 65,527\nOther income not currently taxable (7,574) (13,466) (5,573)\nExpenses not currently deductible 18,652 33,125 41,295\nOther income for tax but not book 5,846 8,215 9,092\nOther deductions/losses for tax not book (519) (5,295) (2,091)\nOther realized gain/loss differences 41,313 (2,762) 18,610\nTaxable income before deductions for distributions $ 273,056 $ 194,851 $ 181,732\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nThe tax character of distributions paid during the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nYears ended September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nOrdinary Income $ 204,806 $ 189,204 $ 190,874\nLong-Term Capital Gains - 5,648 4,691\nReturn of Capital - - 6,625\nThe tax basis components of distributable earnings/(accumulated losses) and reconciliation to accumulated earnings/(deficit) on a book basis for the years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nAs of September 30,\n2022 2021 2020\nUndistributed ordinary income - tax basis $ 39,466 $ - $ -\nUndistributed realized gains - tax basis 28,784 - -\nNet unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments (204,442) (82,787) (217,673)\nOther temporary differences 3,847 1,058 (10,909)\nTotal accumulated earnings (deficit) - book basis $ (132,345) $ (81,729) $ (228,582)\nCapital losses in excess of capital gains earned in a tax year may generally be carried forward and used to offset capital gains, subject to certain limitations. Capital losses incurred by the Company in tax years beginning after September 30, 2011 are not subject to expiration and retain their character as either short-term or long-term capital losses. As of September 30, 2022, the Company estimates that it will not have any capital loss carryforward available for use in subsequent tax years.\nFor tax purposes, the Company may elect to defer any portion of a post-October capital loss or late-year ordinary loss to the first day of the following fiscal year. As of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, the Company elected to defer $0 and $2,270 of ordinary losses, respectively. The Company did not elect to defer any short-term capital losses and long-term capital losses as of both September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company elected to defer short-term capital losses and long-term capital losses of $81 and $11,886, respectively.\nFor the tax year ended September 30, 2022, the Company estimates taxable income in excess of the distributions made from such taxable income during the tax year, and therefore, the Company has elected to carry forward the excess for distribution to stockholders in 2023. The amount carried forward to 2023 is estimated to be approximately $39,466 of ordinary income and $28,784 of long term capital gain, although these amounts will not be finalized until the 2022 tax returns are filed in 2023.\nAs of September 30, 2022, the federal tax cost of investments was $5,683,319 resulting in estimated gross unrealized gains and losses of $84,731 and $321,694, respectively.\nThe Company has consolidated subsidiaries that are subject to U.S. federal and state corporate-level income taxes. For the years ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recorded a tax expense for taxable subsidiaries of $1,229 and $543, respectively. For the year ended September 30, 2020, the Company did not record a tax expense for taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $1,398 for taxable subsidiaries, which is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The deferred tax liability primarily resulted from unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2021, the Company recorded a net deferred tax liability of $543 for taxable subsidiaries, which is included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The deferred tax liability primarily resulted from unrealized appreciation on the investments held at the taxable subsidiaries.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nNote 9. Commitments and Contingencies\nCommitments: As of September 30, 2022, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $224,581, including $35,643 of commitments on undrawn revolvers. As of September 30, 2021, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund investments totaling $340,702, including $42,216 of commitments on undrawn revolvers.\nIndemnifications: In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. The Companys maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as these involve future claims against the Company that have not occurred. The Company expects the risk of any future obligations under these indemnifications to be remote.\nOff-balance sheet risk: Off-balance sheet risk refers to an unrecorded potential liability that may result in a future obligation or loss, even though it does not appear on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The Company has entered and, in the future, may again enter into derivative instruments that contain elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. Refer to Note 5 for outstanding forward currency contracts as of September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Derivative instruments can be affected by market conditions, such as interest rate and foreign currency volatility, which could impact the fair value of the derivative instruments. If market conditions move against the Company, it may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the derivative instruments and may realize a loss. The Company minimizes market risk through monitoring its investments and borrowings.\nConcentration of credit and counterparty risk: Credit risk arises primarily from the potential inability of counterparties to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract. The Company has engaged and, in the future, may engage again in derivative transactions with counterparties. In the event that the counterparties do not fulfill their obligations, the Company may be exposed to risk. The risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparties or issuers of the instruments. The Companys maximum loss that it could incur related to counterparty risk on its derivative instruments is the value of the collateral for that respective derivative instrument. It is the Companys policy to review, as necessary, the credit standing of each counterparty.\nLegal proceedings: In the normal course of business, the Company is subject to legal and regulatory proceedings that are generally incidental to its ongoing operations. While there can be no assurance of the ultimate disposition of any such proceedings, the Company does not believe any disposition will have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements.\nGolub Capital BDC, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(In thousands, except shares and per share data)\nNote 10.
